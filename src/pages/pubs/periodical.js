          <i>On Common Ground&reg;</i> is published in print and online. It is
          concerned with the development of teachers and of their curricula
          through school-university partnerships. Its title, which derives from
          that of the first book on the Institute's work,{' '}
          <i>Teaching in America: The Common Ground</i>, is intended to suggest
          that university faculty and school teachers have a strong mutual
          interest in the improvement of teaching and learning in schools. Since
          2005 the periodical has focused on the work of the Yale National
          Initiative to strengthen teaching in public schools&reg;.

                  especially for its most high need students.” The issue also
