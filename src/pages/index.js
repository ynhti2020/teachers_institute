            <h2>About the Teachers Institute</h2>
            <p>
              The Yale-New Haven Teachers InstituteÂ® is an educational
              partnership between Yale University and the New Haven Public
              Schools designed to strengthen teaching and learning in local
              schools and, by example and direct assistance, in high-need schools across the country.
              Through the Institute, Yale faculty members and New Haven school
              teachers work together in a collegial relationship. The Institute
              is also an interschool and interdisciplinary forum for teachers to
              collaborate on new curricula.

            <h2>Curriculum Units by Teachers</h2>
            <p>
              Each teacher participating as a Fellow in an Institute seminar
              with a Yale faculty member studies the seminar subject and
              prepares a curriculum unit to be taught during the following year. In
              this way teachers deepen their knowledge of the subjects they
              teach and develop new curricular material to engage and educate
              the students in their school courses.
            </p>
