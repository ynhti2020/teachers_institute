<p>The National Demonstration Project, supported by a four-year grant of
$2.5 million from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, aims to demonstrate
the feasibility of adapting at other sites the approach to teachers’ professional
development that has been followed for more than two decades by the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute.  With its support four new Teachers Institutes,
serving urban school systems that enroll students who are mainly from low-income
and minority communities, are now in their second year.  There are
already signs that the National Demonstration Project is attaining a significant
success.
</p><p>From its beginning in 1978 the overall purpose of the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute has been to strengthen teaching and learning in local
schools and, by example, in schools across the country.  It places
equal emphasis on teachers’ increasing their knowledge of a subject and
on their developing teaching strategies that will be effective with their
students.  At the core of the program is a series of seminars on subjects
in the humanities and sciences.  Topics are suggested by the teachers
based on what they think could enrich their classroom instruction. 
In the seminars Yale faculty contribute their knowledge of a subject, while
the New Haven teachers contribute their expertise in elementary and secondary
school pedagogy, their understanding of the students they teach, and their
grasp of what works in the crucible of the classroom.  Successful
completion of a seminar requires that the teachers, with guidance from
a Yale faculty member, each write a curriculum unit to be used in their
own classroom and to be shared with others in the same school and other
schools through both print and electronic publication.
</p><p>Throughout the seminar process teachers are treated as colleagues. 
Unlike conventional university or professional development courses, Institute
seminars involve at their very center an exchange of ideas among teachers
and Yale faculty members.  The teachers admitted to seminars, however,
are not a highly selective group, but rather a cross-section of those in
the system, most of whom, like their urban counterparts across the country,
did not major in one or more of the subjects they teach.  The Institute’s
approach assumes that urban public school teachers can engage in serious
study of the field and can devise appropriate and effective curricula based
on this study.
</p><p>The National Demonstration Project has now established a group of such
Teachers Institutes from coast to coast.  Three-year Implementation
Grants have been awarded to:  Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon
University, in partnership with the Pittsburgh Public Schools; the University
of Houston, in partnership with the Houston Independent School District;
the University of New Mexico, in partnership with the Albuquerque Public
Schools; and the University of California at Irvine, in partnership with
the Santa Ana Unified School District.   At each site the magnitude
and the pattern of needs and resources differ from those in New Haven;
and yet at each site significant opportunities exist for devising an appropriate
scope and local strategies that, without departing from the basic principles
of the Teachers Institute, can meet those needs.
</p><p>In the second year of these Implementation Grants, it is already clear
that the approach of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute can be adapted
to such sites.  Teachers Institutes now exist in cities much larger
than New Haven, and in a variety of institutional contexts, with the participation
of liberal arts colleges, private universities, and state universities,
acting individually or in a consortium.    Institutions
that have long had departments or schools of Education are now devoting
a good deal of their energy to providing seminars for teachers in the liberal
arts and sciences.
</p><p><i>(image available in print form)</i>
</p><p><i><font size="-1">A meeting of teachers and directors of the five Teachers
Institutes in the Faculty Room of Connecticut Hall on Yale's Old Campus,
July 1999.</font></i>
</p><p>Within these Institutes the teachers are finding a greater creative
responsibility for their own curricula, and they are finding an opportunity
to exercise leadership and judgment in sustaining the program of seminars
that provides a continuing professional development.  The university
faculty members are also recognizing more fully their responsibility for
teaching at all levels in their own communities.  As this occurs,
both the school teachers and the university faculty members are discovering
their true collegiality in the ongoing process of learning and teaching. 
And they are realizing both the opportunities and the responsibilities
that follow from their membership in a larger community devoted to the
educational welfare of the young people of this nation.
</p><p>Each of the five existing Teachers Institutes serves an urban school
district that enrolls students who are mainly from low-income communities
and the majority of whom are members of ethnic or racial minorities. 
In New Haven 57 percent of the students in the district are African-American
and 28 percent are Hispanic.  In Pittsburgh, 56 percent of the students
are African-American.  In the participating schools in Houston, 30
percent of the students are African-American and 50 percent are Hispanic. 
In the participating schools in Santa Ana, more than 90 percent of the
students are Hispanic, and more than 70 percent have limited English. 
As the Teachers Institutes enable teachers to improve their preparation
in content fields, prepare curriculum units, and accept responsibility
for much of their own professional development, they are also helping large
numbers of minority students to achieve at higher levels by improving teaching
and learning.
</p><p>In sum, the National Demonstration Project is already showing in four
different cities larger than New Haven
</p><blockquote>• that a Teachers Institute serving approximately 20 schools
that enroll predominantly minority students can be rapidly inaugurated;
<p>• that such a Teachers Institute can immediately carry out a program
of 4-6 content-based seminars in the humanities and sciences, which increase
teachers’ knowledge, heighten their morale, encourage their use of new
technologies, and result in individually crafted curriculum units of substance
for use in classrooms;
</p><p>• that such Institutes will arouse the enthusiasm and support of significant
numbers of teachers and university faculty members;
</p><p>• that such Institutes can attract support—including pledges of continuing
support—from administrators of a private liberal arts college, a private
university emphasizing the sciences, a flagship state university, and a
major state university in a larger system;
</p><p>• that high-level administrators in school districts, superintendents
or their immediate subordinates, will be attracted by the idea of such
an Institute, will start thinking about the local means of scaling-up,
and will commit themselves to its long-term support;
</p><p>• and that the strategies employed in establishing the National Demonstration
Project, including National Seminars and observation of local seminars
in New Haven, are admirably suited for the process of further disseminating
the Yale-New Haven model and establishing a nation-wide network of Teachers
Institutes.</p></blockquote>
We hope that on its completion the National Demonstration Project will
have made amply clear the importance of the principles upon which these
Institutes are based. We also hope that it will have shown that new Teachers
Institutes can sustain themselves after the initial Grant.  If so,
it will have provided the foundation for the expansion of some Teachers
Institutes and the establishment of yet others in cities across the nation. 
And it will have shown that such Teachers Institutes can make a substantial
contribution to the most important kind of school reform in this nation—the
improvement of teaching itself.

<a name="b"></a><b>ESTABLISHING THE PROJECT</b>
<p>During 1997, with the support of a Planning Grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute had explored the feasibility
and desirability of establishing new Teachers Institutes at a number of
sites. The Planning Team assisting in this effort included James R. Vivian,
Director of the Institute; Carla Asher, Program Officer, DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund; faculty members from Yale University who had led Institute
seminars; teachers and an administrator from the New Haven School system
who had been Institute Fellows; and teachers, faculty members, and administrators
drawn from the Albuquerque, New Mexico school system, the University of
California at Irvine, and the University of Michigan.  The Teachers
Institute compiled a preliminary list of hundreds of schools and colleges
from which, since 1978, it had received requests for assistance. 
It then surveyed 33 sites to determine their interest in adapting the Institute
approach, sending to each both printed materials and videos to explain
the nature and process of the Institute.  It also developed a list
of categories within which adaptations of the Institute should fall. 
Visits were then made to five sites in order to communicate the nature
of the National Demonstration Project, to clarify and amplify the Institute’s
understanding of the issues involved in adapting its model, and to begin
to assess the desirability and feasibility of participation by those sites.
</p><p>Those visits and correspondence with additional sites led the Planning
Team to conclude that the time was right for the establishment of several
demonstration projects committed to the principles of collaboration that
the Institute had developed over the previous two decades.  
The Institute therefore proposed to the Fund in October 1997 a four-year
project that would constitute a major step toward the nationwide establishment
of such Teachers Institutes.  The Planning Team helped to prepare
a Request for Proposals that would specify the criteria essential to the
Institute approach, which would have to be met by any adaptation. 
Institute staff also developed the financial requirements and expectations
that would be part of the Request for Proposals.  The Institute’s
proposal to the Fund envisaged that, on the basis of proposals for eight-month
Planning Grants, a National Panel would recommend to the Director of the
Institute five or six sites that seemed most likely to deserve subsequent
three-year support and that should therefore receive Planning Grants. 
During the balance of 1998 the Institute would work closely with those
sites, providing a variety of assistance.  There would be a July Intensive
Session with National Seminars and other meetings to make possible first-hand
experience of the Institute’s policies and procedures.
</p><p>Three-year Implementation Grants would then be awarded to three sites,
by the same procedure as before. Those sites would work closely with the
Institute during the period from 1998 through 2001 as they prepared and
launched their own partnerships and their own annual seminars.  They
would maintain the Institute’s basic principles but would adapt their scopes
and strategies to fit their own resources and the needs of their specific
locations.  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute would collaborate
with the new Teachers Institutes to provide continuing Directors’ meetings,
a National Steering Committee of teachers, and a University Faculty Advisory
Committee, as well as another July Intensive Session in 1999, and three
October Conferences in 1999, 2000, and 2001 to share the ongoing challenges
and results.
</p><p>Because the ground would be prepared for a self-sustaining organization
at each of the demonstration sites, they could be expected to continue
their programs after the completion of the Grant period.  The National
Demonstration Project would not only benefit the teachers and students
in those communities; it would also establish a potentially expandable
network of Teachers Institutes that should have a significant impact upon
education reform throughout this nation.  The entire process would
be documented by persons at the Teachers Institute and at the demonstration
sites, and by an external evaluation to be commissioned by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund.
</p><p>After the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute was awarded the four-year
Implementation Grant by the Fund in March 1998, it invited fourteen sites
to submit proposals for 8-month Planning Grants.  It also activated
an Implementation Team, drawn from its Planning Team, which consists of
Yale faculty members, New Haven teachers, and New Haven school administrators. 
The Implementation Team was charged with making further site visits during
the term of the Grant and assisting with the organization of the National
Seminars and the holding of other sessions in New Haven.  In April,
at a voluntary Information Session in New Haven, the Teachers Institute
offered further explanations of its policies and procedures.  In June
a National Panel considered the applications for Planning Grants. 
On recommendation of the Panel and on the advice of the Program Officer
from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, the Institute awarded Planning
Grants to five applicants.  It then asked the sites that received
Planning Grants to send teams comprised of a Planning Director, university
faculty members, and teachers to the July Intensive Session in New Haven. 
During this ten-day event three National Seminars, other meetings, and
written projects for Planning Directors and university faculty members
enabled each site to assess the relevance of the New Haven experience to
its own needs and resources.
</p><p>In December, again on recommendation of the National Panel and on the
advice of the Program Officer of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund,
the Teachers Institute awarded Implementation Grants to the four partnerships
that had applied for them. The inclusion of four sites, instead of the
three originally envisioned in the Teachers Institute’s proposal to the
DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, was made possible in part by a supplementary
grant of $150,000 by the McCune Charitable Foundation.  These new
Teachers Institutes had all committed themselves to the basic principles
of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, as set forth in the Request for
Proposals and repeated in slightly condensed form in the Appendix to this
brochure.   They offered their first annual cycle of seminars
in 1999, and the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute began to work with them
on their plans for the coming years.  In 1999 all five Institutes
came together in New Haven for a January Orientation Session, another July
Intensive Session (on this occasion with four National Seminars), and an
October Conference to share their various areas of major accomplishment. 
In 2000, the new Institutes are offering their second annual cycle of seminars. 
All five Institutes are coming together in October for a second Annual
Conference to share their experiences.

<a name="c"></a><b>A NETWORK OF TEACHERS INSTITUTES</b>
<p>Each of the five Teachers Institutes now established has a distinctive
pattern of needs and resources.  Each is at a somewhat different stage
of development and illustrates a somewhat different pattern of relationship
to local resources, institutional apparatus, and state mandates. Each may
therefore serve as a somewhat different example for the establishment of
Teachers Institutes elsewhere in the United States.  All four of the
new Teachers Institutes are serving school systems that are considerably
larger than that of New Haven, and each must also deal with certain of
the serious problems associated with low-income communities and a high
proportion of racial and ethnic diversity.  They illustrate a variety
of institutional arrangements.  The institutions of higher education
include:  in Pittsburgh a partnership between a private university
focused upon the sciences and a small liberal arts college; in Houston
a state-supported urban university; in Albuquerque a flagship state university;
and in Irvine a university that is part of a larger state system and is
collaborating with the nearby school district of Santa Ana.  In contrast
to the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, the new Teachers Institutes will
show how a professional development program in the humanities and sciences
can exist in harmony with a school or department of Education.  They
also illustrate different ways of providing for a full-time directorship,
and they are adopting an array of different scopes and strategies directed
toward having a significant impact upon a large school district. 
The following sections of this brochure will provide basic information
about each Teachers Institute, sketch the programs being carried out during
2000, and describe more fully the arrangements for communication, dissemination,
documentation, and evaluation.

<a name="d"></a><b>THE YALE-NEW HAVEN TEACHERS INSTITUTE</b>
<p>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute brings the resources of Yale University
to an entire school district in which 44 schools serve nearly 20,000 students.  
More than 60 percent of the students come from families receiving public
assistance, and 85 percent are either African-American or Hispanic. 
There are about 1,000 teachers eligible for participation in the Institute. 
During its twenty-two years of existence, the Institute has offered 143
seminars to 522 individual teachers, many of whom have participated for
more than one year. Thus far the teachers have created 1,286 curriculum
units.  Currently, 33 percent of New Haven high school teachers of
subjects in the humanities and sciences, 33 percent of transitional school
teachers, 30 percent of middle school teachers, and 12 percent of elementary
school teachers have completed successfully at least one year of the Institute. 
Over the years, a total of 110 Yale faculty members, about half of whom
are current or recently retired members of the faculty, have participated
in the Institute by giving talks or leading one or more seminars. 
The founding Director of the Institute is James R. Vivian.
</p><p>For the duration of the Grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest
Fund, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute will have a dual relationship
to the four other Teachers Institutes.  It is both monitor of the
Grant and a senior colleague.  It offers technical assistance to the
other Teachers Institutes, convenes the October Conferences, maintains
the National Steering Committee and the National University Advisory Council,
sponsors the national periodical On Common Ground, and helps in other ways
to further the aims of the entire network of Teachers Institutes. 
At the same time, it encourages each of the other Teachers Institutes to
develop both a necessary independence and a collaborative spirit. 
Its aim is to assist in transforming the group of five Teachers Institutes
into a fully collaborative network that might in the future extend its
membership to include Institutes at yet other sites.
</p><p>In 2000, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute offered seven seminars
for 62 teachers: “Sound and Sensibility:  Acoustics in Architecture,
Music, and the Environment” (Robert E. Apfel, Robert Higgin Professor of
Mechanical Engineering); “The Chemistry of Photosynthesis” (Gary W. Brudvig,
Professor of Chemistry); “Women Writers in Latin America” (Sandra H. Ferdman-Comas,
Assistant Professor of Spanish and Portuguese); “Bioethics” (Arthur W.
Galston, Eaton Professor Emeritus of Botany and of Molecular, Cellular,
and Developmental Biology); “Crime and Punishment” (Ian Shapiro, Professor
and Chair of Political Science); “Constitutional and Statutory Privacy
Protections in the 21st Century” (Rogers M. Smith, Alfred Cowles Professor
of Government); and “Ethnicity and Dissent in American Literature and Art”
(Brian J. Wolf, Professor and Chair of American Studies and Professor of
English).

<a name="e"></a><b>THE PITTSBURGH TEACHERS INSTITUTE</b>
<p>The Pittsburgh Teachers Institute brings the resources of Chatham College
and Carnegie Mellon University to a selected portion of a school district
with 97 schools serving 39,000 students.  Chatham brings to the collaboration
with the Pittsburgh Public Schools the strengths of a small liberal arts
college; Carnegie Mellon brings those of a university with a strong program
in the sciences.  Both institutions have previously worked with the
schools—Carnegie Mellon, for example, sponsoring a program in the teaching
of science, and Chatham maintaining a program in teacher certification. 
This is the first occasion, however, when the two institutions have collaborated
on a project in partnership with the schools.
</p><p>This Teachers Institute works with 20 elementary, middle, and high schools,
representing the three regions of the district, which have volunteered
to take part.  It seeks to ensure that all curriculum units adhere
to the academic standards and core curriculum of the Pittsburgh Public
Schools.  Helen Faison, an experienced teacher and school administrator,
a former chair of the Education Department at Chatham College and a former
interim Superintendent of Schools, serves as Director.
</p><p>In 2000, this Institute offered six seminars for 48 teachers: 
“Pittsburgh Writers” (James Davidson, Adjunct Professor of English, Carnegie
Mellon  University); “Interdisciplinary Views of Pittsburgh History”
(Steffi Domike, Visiting Professor of Art, Chatham College); “Learning
Physics through Science Fiction” (Richard Holman, Professor of Physics,
Carnegie Mellon University); “American History through Art” (Elisabeth
Roark, Assistant Professor of Art, Chatham College); “Proof in Mathematics: 
Origin, Practice, Crisis” (Juan Jorge Schäffer, Professor of Mathematical
Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University); and “Religion in American Society”
(Janet Stocks, Director of Undergraduate Research and Associate Provost
of Academic Affairs, Carnegie Mellon University).

<p>In the fourth largest city in the United States, the Houston Teachers
Institute brings the resources of the University of Houston to the Houston
Independent School District, where 280 schools serve 212,000 students.. 
The Houston Teachers Institute builds upon the experience of the Common
Ground project at the University, directed first by James Pipkin and then
by William Monroe, which assisted high school teachers in expanding the
canon of literary texts that are taught in English classes.  The late
Michael Cooke, a Yale faculty member and participant in the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute, had served as an advisor for that project.
</p><p>The Houston Teachers Institute works with 20 self-selected middle and
high schools enrolling 31,300 students to establish a program that will
address the needs of an ethnically mixed student-body, a large proportion
of whom are non-English speaking.  Paul Cooke, who has been a Visiting
Assistant Professor of Political Science, serves as Director.
</p><p>In 2000, this Institute offered six seminars for 41 teachers: “Adolescence

Warming and Air Pollution” (James Lawrence, Associate Professor of Geoscience);
“Issues in Creativity” (David Jacobs, Professor of Art); “Critical Analysis
of Graeco-Roman Myths and Related Contemporary Issues” (Dora Pozzi, Professor

<a name="g"></a><b>THE ALBUQUERQUE TEACHERS INSTITUTE</b>
<p>To a selected portion of a district that serves 85,000 students in 122
schools and enrolls a high percentage of Hispanic students from low-income
families, the Albuquerque Teachers Institute brings the resources of the
University of New Mexico, the flagship state institution of higher education. 
The University has long worked with the schools through its Department
of Education and a variety of teacher training programs.
</p><p>The Albuquerque Teachers Institute seeks to focus upon the high attrition
rate in the schools, and has therefore selected 21 middle and high schools
where that problem is most serious.  It often seeks to establish the
relevance and interest of its program for both teachers and students by
focusing on Southwest-related themes, and it aims to develop curricula
that integrate content standards and rubrics for the assessment of student
achievement.  The Director of the Albuquerque Teachers Institute is
Doug Earick, a veteran teacher of science in the Albuquerque Public Schools.
</p><p>In 2000, this Institute offered six seminars for 51 teachers: 
“Atomic America:  Technology, Representation, and Culture in the 20th
Century” (Timothy Moy, Assistant Professor of History); “Human Decision-Making: 
Rational and Irrational” (Kate Krause, Assistant Professor of Economics);
“The Indo-Hispano Cultural Legacy of New Mexico” (Enrique Lamadrid, Assistant
Professor of Spanish and Portuguese); “Weighing Environmental Risks: 
Uncertainties and Variables” (David S. Gutzler, Associate Professor of
Climatology, Department of Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences); “The United
States of America:  The Ideal and the Reality” (Fred Harris, Professor
of Political Science); and “Literature and the Environment” (Gary Harrison,

<p>To Santa Ana, a city with 51 schools serving 59,000 students, a majority
of whom have only a limited knowledge of English, the UCI-Santa Ana Teachers
Institute brings the resources of the nearby University of California at
Irvine. The University has long worked in a variety of ways with school
systems in several neighboring districts, in large part now through its
Center for Educational Partnerships.
</p><p>The UCI-Santa Ana Teachers Institute focuses on 26 elementary, middle,
and high schools that represent all four areas of the Santa Ana system.
There is here a special opportunity to show that Institute curriculum units
work well in a mainly Hispanic environment where the majority of students
have little fluency in English.  The Director of the UCI-Santa Ana
Teachers Institute is Barbara Kuhn Al-Bayati, who has been the Liaison
Officer in the Center for Educational Partnerships at the University.
</p><p>In 2000 this Institute offered seven seminars for 70 teachers: 
“The Natural History of Orange County” (Peter J. Bryant, Professor of 
Developmental and Cell Biology); “U.S. Literary Culture and Globalization”
(John C. Rowe, Professor of English and Comparative Literature); 
“What Are the Chances of That?  Probability in Everyday Life” (Amelia
Regan, Assistant Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering); “The
Hardy Personality in Theory, Research, and Practice” (Salvatore Maddi,
Professor of Psychology and Social Behavior, and Deborah Khoshaba, Director,
Program Development and Training, Hardiness Institute); “Teaching Religion
Critically” (John H. Smith, Professor of  German); “Inventing America”
(Michael Clark, Professor of English and Comparative Literature; Jacobo
Sefami, Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; and Steven Topik, Professor
of History); and “Impacts of Computer and Networking Technologies on Education”
(Stephen D. Franklin, Assistant Director, Office of Academic Computing,
and Lecturer in Information and Computer Science).

<a name="i"></a><b>COMMUNICATION AND DISSEMINATION</b>
<p>This network of Teachers Institutes has already established an appropriate
network of communication.  A range of technical assistance, which
includes site visits, meetings of the Directors, and advice on specific
problems, is being provided to the new Teachers Institutes by the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute. Each year the new Teachers Institutes provide
reports, described in the section on Documentation and Evaluation, to the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.   There is also lateral communication
among the new Teachers Institutes and common work undertaken by all five
Institutes.
</p><p>The National Steering Committee, which consists of a teacher from each
Institute, takes a major initiative in planning this common work and encouraging
communication among teachers from the five sites.  It is complemented
by the National University Advisory Council, which consists of a faculty
member from each Institute.  There has been established an electronic
Teachers Institute Faculty Forum to facilitate communication among faculty
members from the five sites (<a href="mailto:tiff@yale.edu">tiff@yale.edu</a>),
and a similar forum is planned for the teachers.  The National Steering
Committee and the National University Advisory Council assisted a planning
committee in arranging the October Conference in 1999 and will do so again
in 2000 and 2001.  Those Conferences provide opportunity for sharing
of accomplishments and challenges across the sites.  If additional
funding can be obtained, the October Conference in 2001 and possibly another
such Conference in 2002 could become national in scope, bringing together
representatives from various sectors of the educational, funding, and policy-making
communities.  Such National Conferences would be an important step
in disseminating the results of the National Demonstration Project and
encouraging the establishment of a second phase of Teachers Institutes
in other cities.
</p><p><i>(image available in print form)</i>
</p><p><i><font size="-1">Representatives of the Pittsburgh Teachers Institute
at the First Annual Conference in New Haven, October 1999.</font></i>
</p><p>The Web site of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute already makes
available the publications of this Institute, including all of the curriculum
units that have been written.  Comparable Web sites have been established
by other Institutes and so provide further links among them.  
A developing electronic network is therefore linking the Institutes more
closely.  If additional funding can be obtained, the opportunity exists
for the establishment of a Web site dedicated to the National Demonstration
Project as an entity.  Such a Web site would be not only a communications
hub for the work of the Project but also an important continuing means
of disseminating its results to the nation.  If other Teachers Institutes
should be established, this Web site would be of even greater importance
as a national center of information on university-school partnerships.
</p><p>The periodical <i>On Common Ground</i> is potentially an important means
of disseminating the results of the National Demonstration Project. 
Number 9, for Winter 2000/2001, will contain articles by persons from each
of the sites on some aspect of the process of establishing a Teachers Institute
and meeting the needs of an urban school district.  If funding can
be obtained for further numbers, <i>On Common Ground</i> will be able to
provide a detailed account for a national readership of the opportunities
seized, the obstacles encountered and overcome, and the major accomplishments
of the four new Teachers Institutes.  Such an account would be invaluable
in the attempt further to expand this network of Teachers Institutes.

<a name="j"></a><b>DOCUMENTATION AND EVALUATION</b>
<p><a name="k"></a><b>Internal Documentation and Evaluation</b>
</p><p>Each of the new Teachers Institutes submits to the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute interim financial reports and annual narrative and financial
reports.  Each will also submit final narrative and financial reports. 
The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute submits to the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund annual narrative and financial reports, and will submit final
narrative and financial reports, all of which will synthesize and assess
the information provided by the sites.
</p><p>These reports describe the scope, strategy, demonstration goals, and
progress of the new Teachers Institutes.  They include evidence that
the new Institutes remain in accord with the basic principles of the Teachers
Institute approach.  They describe the curriculum units developed,
the relationship between participating school teachers and university faculty,
the nature and extent of leadership exerted by teacher-participants, the
incentives for university faculty members and school teachers to participate,
and the assistance from the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute that has
been needed, obtained, and used.  They include an analysis of the
participation of school teachers in Institute activities, using surveys
and other instruments developed by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
and modified as needed to make possible comparisons across the five partnerships. 
They analyze the factors contributing to, and hindering, the success of
the new Institutes, and the effects of those Institutes upon teacher empowerment,
curricular change, and other issues central to school reform.  They
also give an account of the progress made toward funding the new Institutes
beyond the period of this Grant.  At least once during the Grant period,
annual reports will also include surveys of the use of curriculum units
by Fellows and non-Fellows in the school systems.  The final report
from the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute will summarize the three-year
demonstration, make clear the most important outcomes, impacts, and lessons
learned, describe how the demonstration has changed and how we may address
the issues it has posed, and indicate the plans at each site for continuing
the partnership.
</p><p><a name="l"></a><b>External Evaluation</b>
</p><p>The DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund contracted with Policy Studies
Associates, a research and social policy firm based in Washington, D.C.,
to evaluate the National Demonstration Project.  The evaluation will
examine the implementation of Teachers Institutes at universities and their
partner schools participating in the project from 1999-2002.
</p><p>The Fund is supporting the National Demonstration Project and its evaluation
to accomplish two goals: to contribute to the professional development
of teachers by supporting partnerships between universities and public
school systems that draw upon the experiences of the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute; and to gather information that will enable others to decide
whether to build similar partnerships using their own resources. 
The Fund-commissioned evaluation will provide universities and public school
systems throughout the nation with answers to questions that they are likely
to have about the utility of the National Demonstration Project as a source
of ideas that they could use to create Teachers Institutes in their communities.
</p><p>Over the course of their work, researchers are focusing on examining
and documenting the following:
</p><blockquote>• The experiences and perceptions of teachers who participate
in the Institutes, as well as school administrators who interact with the
Institutes;
<p>• The recruitment process for participating teachers;
</p><p>• The educational partnerships between the university sites and their
partner-schools and districts;
</p><p>• The benefits that teachers gain from participating in the Institutes;
</p><p>• The cost of establishing a Teachers Institute;
</p><p>• Additional information to assist other interested universities and
school systems in establishing their own Teachers Institutes.</p></blockquote>

<a name="m"></a><b>EXPANSION AND AFFILIATION</b>
<p>The expansion of existing Teachers Institutes in large cities may occur
through a step-by-step process of scaling up, as more school teachers and
university faculty become interested in participating, and as increased
funding allows the offering of more seminars.  A Teachers Institute
may begin in this way to expand its scope of operation within a city. When
the resources of a single institution of higher education are not adequate
to meet the needs of a large school district, it may prove desirable to
expand the partnership.  There seems a possibility, for example, of
expanding the partnership between Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon University
to include other institutions in Pittsburgh.   It also may be
possible at some point for the Houston Teachers Institute to draw upon
faculty from other institutions of higher education in Houston.  But
there are also opportunities for other kinds of expansion within a given
scope.  Teachers Institutes may wish to establish Centers for Curriculum
and Professional Development in the schools, as has been done in New Haven,
which may bring to a larger number of classroom teachers the work of Fellows
in the Institute.  Through such Centers they may wish to establish
Academies in summer or after school, as has also been done in New Haven,
in which teachers may collaboratively shape and showcase a curriculum for
selected students on the basis of their work in the Institute.
</p><p>There are also different ways in which new Teachers Institutes might
be established at other sites.  Additional funding on a national level
could enable, in one or more phases, the expansion of the existing network
of Teachers Institutes.  This process would make it possible for the
new Institutes to receive technical assistance and collaborative support
from those already established.   Additional funding on a local
level might enable the establishment of a new Teachers Institute that would
be free-standing but would have the opportunity to affiliate itself with
the existing network.  By either route or both at once, more urban
school districts and institutions of higher education might join together
to form a yet larger network of Teachers Institutes that could become a
major force in the reform and revitalizing of teaching and learning in
this country.

<a name="n"></a><b>APPENDIX:  BASIC PRINCIPLES</b>
<p>The following principles, fundamental to the approach that has been
developed by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, are quoted with slight
condensation from the Request for Proposals for Implementation Grants and
Appendix B (“Project Reporting Guidelines”) in the Institute contracts.  
They are included here because they are the guiding principles for each
of the four new Teachers Institutes.  Although listed as separate
principles, they are interrelated elements of an organically unified approach.
</p><p>1)  The new Institute links an institution or institutions of higher
education to a school district (or districts) in which a significant proportion
of the students come from low-income communities.  It offers a distinctive
plan for an adaptation of the Institute’s approach, addressing an educational
problem that may be appropriately addressed by that approach.  The
size, scope, and emphasis of the adaptation depend upon the needs of the
district(s), the educational resources available, and the expected funding.
</p><p>2)  A continuing, full-time director (or, if approved, two half-time
directors) provided by the Institute serves as  convenor, administrator,
liaison between the district(s)  and the administration and faculty
of the institution(s) of higher education, and fund-raiser.  The director
reports to the chief officers of the institution(s) and the district(s),
and is able to recruit faculty from various parts of the institution(s)
of higher education.
</p><p>3)  The Institute is led in crucial respects by teachers in the
district(s), who play a major and indispensable role in the planning, organization,
conduct, and evaluation of the programs intended to benefit them and, through
them, their students.  They are involved in initiating and approving
decisions with respect to seminars offered, within the scope determined
as feasible and appropriate by university and school district administrators
and the director.  The seminars are special offerings designed to
address the Fellows’ interests and needs for further preparation and curriculum
development.  The Fellows are not students in university courses. 
Rather, they are considered full members of the university community during
the year in which they are taking a seminar.
</p><p>4)  There is a pool of teachers in the schools prepared to play
a leading role in planning, organizing, sustaining, and evaluating the
new Institute.  They are responsible for recruiting other teachers
into the program.  There is also a pool of faculty members from the
liberal arts and/or sciences in the institution(s) of higher education
who teach at the undergraduate and/or graduate levels and who are prepared
to lead seminars, advise in the shaping of curriculum, and endorse the
curriculum offered by the Institute.  If faculty members from departments,
schools, or colleges of Education are involved in the Institute’s program,
they should indicate their readiness to lead seminars that focus primarily
upon “content” rather than “pedagogy.”  All teacher-leaders and university
faculty members should understand the distinctive nature of such collaborative
work and should be eager and willing to participate in it.
</p><p>5)  Policies within the school district(s) pertaining to curriculum
and professional development (as established by the state, the school board,
the union, or specific administrators) must be conducive to the development
of the Institute, or at least not incompatible with it.
</p><p>6)  The curriculum will consist of intensive long-term seminars
in several disciplines on broadly defined topics (meeting over a period
of months) in which the seminar leader and the Fellows will study and discuss
certain common texts, objects, or places and each Fellow will prepare a
substantial “curriculum unit” that he or she intends to employ in the classroom
during the following year.  This curriculum unit will consist of an
essay on the material to be presented in the classroom and the pedagogical
strategies to be employed, followed by several lesson plans, which are
examples of those to be used by the teacher, and an annotated bibliography. 
The curriculum units may bear a variety of relationships to the general
topic of the seminar, appropriate to the grade-level and the aims of the
teacher.  They will have immediate application in the classroom, and
they will be consistent with the curricular guidelines provided by district
or school that are to be followed by the teacher.
</p><p>7)  Participating teachers from the institution(s) of higher education
and the  schools are considered professional colleagues working within
a collegial relationship.  Seminar leaders and Fellows understand
that all participants bring to the seminar important strengths, both experience
and knowledge, with respect to the seminar topic and/or its potential relevance
to the classroom.
</p><p>8)  Although the seminar leaders are primarily responsible for
presenting to the seminar the “content” or “knowledge” of one or more disciplines,
the seminar itself will at appropriate points involve consideration both
of that content and of the procedures necessary to present it in the classroom. 
That consideration, to which the Fellows will bring their own experience,
is important in establishing the collegiality in the seminar.
</p><p>9)  To strengthen teaching and learning throughout the schools,
the new Institute must involve a significant proportion of all teachers
within its designated scope and must therefore actively recruit teachers
who have not participated before.  The Institute must have a rationale
for the designated scope and make clear how it will involve a significant
proportion of the teachers within that scope.
</p><p>10)  Within its designated scope, the Institute encourages any
teacher to apply who has a teaching assignment relevant to a seminar topic,
can present a proposal for a curriculum unit relevant to that topic, and
will be assigned to teach a course in which  that unit can be used. 
It makes every effort to ensure that the pool of teachers applying to the
Institute represents a cross-section of all eligible teachers.  Its
program should attract teachers regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, academic
background, professional experience, and length of time in teaching.
</p><p>11)  In order to recognize the intensive, demanding, and professionally
significant nature of their participation in the seminars, the seminar
leaders will be provided with some remuneration, and the Fellows, who participate
on a voluntary basis, will be provided with some appropriate honorarium
and/or stipend.  This honorarium or stipend for participating school
teachers is not salary or wages and is therefore not to be viewed as subject
to any conditions of employment.
</p><p>12)  The institutional and district administrations are committed
to a continuing collaboration with each other during the Grant period on
the basis of this plan and also to its extension beyond the Grant period.
</p><p>13)  There will be ongoing financial support from both the institution(s)
of higher education and the school district(s).  They are committed
to provide or seek necessary supplementary funding for the duration of
the Grant, and have plans to seek entire funding thereafter.
</p><p>14)  Because each new Institute is a “demonstration site,” making
clear the advantages and difficulties of adapting the Institute approach
to another situation, there will be an explicit and visible relation between
the new Institutes and the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.
</p><p>15)  Each new Institute is committed to communicating with the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and with the other new Institutes, and
to disseminating their experience of the adaptation in various ways to
other potential and actual Institutes across the nation.  The means
of communication may include personal visits, e-mail, news groups, online
chats, text-based forums, etc., and will also include written accounts
by the new  Institutes for publication in<i> On Common Ground.</i>
</p><p>16 )  The new Institutes are committed to undertaking at their
own cost, in cooperation with the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, an
annual review of the progress of the project.  They assume responsibility
for their continuing self-evaluation, in cooperation with the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute.  They will provide the staff, the Implementation
Team of New Haven colleagues, and other documenters that may be sent by
that Institute and by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund with full
access to their activities and their documentation, including school and
university personnel and sites.  Each new Institute should anticipate
the possibility that significant failure to reach stated goals of the demonstration,
or to maintain it in accordance with the conditions agreed upon, could
result in the termination of the funding.  Each new Institute will
submit annual reports to the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute that provide:
</p><blockquote>•  a systematic description of the new Institute and its
activities, including ways that it has adapted the New Haven approach,
the process by which it was established, how that process has unfolded
over time, and the progress made toward the goals of the demonstration;
<p>•  evidence that the new Institute is faithful to each of the basic
principles of the New Haven approach;
</p><p>•  indication of the incentives at the new Institute for university
faculty members and school teachers to participate;
</p><p>•  the cost of operating the Institute, set forth in detail as
specified in the financial reporting requirements; a documentation of other
funds allocated to the Institute; and the availability of long-term funding
sources;
</p><p>•  an analysis of data on the participation of teachers in Institute
activities;
</p><p>•  a summary description of the curriculum units developed by participating
teachers, with information about the teachers’ use of the Units and any
other outcomes of their participation;
</p><p>•  an account of the assistance from the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute that was needed, obtained, and used;
</p><p>•  a description of the relationship between participating teachers
and university faculty;
</p><p>•  an analysis of the factors contributing to, and hindering, the
success of the new Institute;
</p><p>•  an analysis of the effects of the new Institute upon teacher
empowerment, curricular change, and other issues central to school reform;
</p><p>•  documentation of the partnership’s collaborative work with the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute (including responses to questionnaires
dealing with the July Intensive Session in 1999 and the October conferences
in 1999, 2000, and 2001);
</p><p>•  an account of the progress made toward the goal of funding the
Institute beyond the period of this Grant.</p></blockquote>
Using surveys and other instruments developed by the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute, each new Institute will document:  the number of teachers
who apply; the representativeness of those teachers vis-à-vis the
entire pool of teachers eligible to participate; teachers’ and faculty
members’ assessments of the new Institute; and the classroom use to which
teachers put the curriculum units.  The new Institutes will work with
the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute to make whatever changes in the instruments
may be needed to adapt them so that the results will be comparable across
the different demonstration sites.
<p>At least once during the grant period, an annual report will include
a survey of the use of curriculum units by Fellows and non-Fellows in the
school system.  Each report will also include a summary that sets
forth in brief compass the accomplishments and impact of the demonstration,
the impediments encountered, the unanticipated outcomes, and the lessons
learned thus far.
</p><p>The final narrative report will summarize the three-year demonstration
in terms of the items covered by the annual narrative reports and will
then answer the following questions:
</p><blockquote>1. What do you think are the most important outcomes, impacts,
and lessons learned from this project?
<p>2. How has it changed the way in which your institution or other institutions
may address these issues?
</p><p>3. What plans do you have for continuing the partnership at your site?
</p><p>4. Are there any other observations or reflections that you would now
like to make about your partnership’s work under this grant?</p></blockquote>
