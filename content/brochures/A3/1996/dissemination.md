The Institute continued during 1996 to disseminate its work by responding
to inquiries, publishing its periodical, producing a new videotape
program, and examining more systematic ways of working with schools and
universities located in other cities.
<h3>Publication of <i>On Common Ground
</i></h3>	
Requests for information about the operation of the
Institute in New Haven were often the direct result of someone viewing the
Institute s first videotape program, "Teaching On Common Ground," or
reading about the Institute in its periodical, <i>On Common Ground. </i>
During 1996 the Institute responded to numerous inquiries from individuals
representing diverse organizations that included, by way of example,
Rutgers University in New Jersey; Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania;
Mayville State University in North Dakota; Rollins College in Florida;
Morgantown Elementary School in West Virginia; Washington University in
St. Louis; Rudolf Steiner College in California; and The City of South
Charleston in West Virginia.  In several cases, the person making the
request indicated that he or she was exploring the establishment of a
program similar to the Teachers Institute for their own community.

With support in part from the Carnegie Corporation of New
York, the Institute published two numbers of the periodical during 1996.
Number 6 (Spring 1996) on "Educational Organization and Change" included
articles by Arthur Levine, President of Teachers College, Columbia
University; Sherry H. Penney, Chancellor of the University of
Massachusetts, Boston; Gene I. Maeroff, Senior Fellow at the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching; Sophie Sa, Executive Director
of the Panasonic Foundation; and by various other school and college
educators.  It also contained tributes to Fred M. Hechinger, former
Education Editor of <i>The New York Times,</i> and Ernest L. Boyer, who
was
President of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, both
long-time members of the Institute s National Advisory Committee.  The
Number inaugurated a new  Superintendents  and Principals  Forum,  which
will complement the continuing forum, "Voices from the Classroom."
<p>
Number 7 (Fall 1996), devoted to topics in "Diversity,
Partnership, and Community,"  included articles by Manuel N. Gomez, Vice
Chancellor of Student Services at the University of California at Irvine;
Howard R. Lamar, President Emeritus and Sterling Professor Emeritus of
History at Yale University; Richard H. Brodhead, A. Bartlett Giamatti
Professor of English and Dean of Yale College; James W. Pipkin, Dean of
Fine Arts at the University of Houston; Ronald Takaki, Professor of Ethnic
Studies Department at the University of California, Berkeley; and by
various other school and college educators.  More specifically, Vice
Chancellor Gomez argues that it "is al too tempting to lose faith in
education right now," but concludes that "partnership is the means by
which we can renew a national commitment to the health of American
democracy"   He adds, "Without educational partnerships between
institutions, the intellectual development of our students will continue
to atrophy."
</p></td></tr><tr><td>
In an article entitled "Encounter with a City,"  President
Lamar tells how he explored, with his seminar community of school
teachers, the history of that larger and continually changing urban
community, New Haven.  Dean Brodhead writes of his experience leading an
Institute seminar and tells of the dialectical interaction between
teachers in the university and those in the schools, through which both
can broaden and enrich their own understanding of a possible educational
community.  Bryan J. Wolf, Professor of American Studies and English at
Yale, tells how, through working in the Institute with school teachers, he
discovered ways in which he might refocus his own university teaching so
that it does ampler justice to the richness of racial and ethnic
communities in America.  "To teach a class with soul," he says, "is to tap
into the diversity of everyday American expressive life, catching that
life as it is transformed into art."  Janet Ray Edwards, Program Officer
in the Division of Research and Education at the National Endowment for
the Humanities, deals with the impelling national need of building
educational communities around issues of ethnic and cultural diversity.
Edwards suggests how adaptable is the approach of the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute to an array of different settings and thematic
emphases.  "Student Voices" in the Number includes a report by Reverend
Frederick J. Streets, Chaplain and Pastor at Yale University, on his work
as facilitator for a focus-group discussion with African-American high
school students.

To assist with the periodical, the Editorial Board for
<i>On Common Ground </i>met twice during the year.  The Board s role is
very much in keeping with the original conception of the periodical: that
is, that <i>On Common Ground </i>not be merely descriptive or promotional
of particular collaborative programs but that, instead, it provide a forum
for more thoughtful, provocative, and analytical writing about this
educational field.  The Board has been of invaluable assistance not only
in conceiving of the nature of the publication, but also in formulating
topics and approaching individuals to write articles for each number the
Institute publishes.  
<p>
Meeting in Santa Fe for two days in February 1996, the
Editorial Board addressed the contents, illustration, appearance, and
circulation of the periodical.  Each topic was approached from the
perspective of the varied constituencies among its readership.  A
particular focus of the meeting was school administrators' views on
school-university partnership and on the relation of partnerships to
school organization and change.  Board members Thomas Persing and Charles
Serns made informal presentations and then led discussion on this topic.
Excerpts from the discussion were printed in Number 6 as the "Principals'
and Superintendents' Forum,"  mentioned above, introducing this as a
regular element of the periodical. 
</p><p>
The Board discussed articles submitted and possible images
for Numbers 6 and 7, criteria for images used in the periodical, and
possible publication in book form of articles first published in <i>On
Common Ground, </i>and later revised and expanded for this purpose.  The
Board also decided that we should urge individuals who receive the
periodical to give their copy to libraries.

Meeting in New Haven on November 8-9, 1996, the Board discussed responses
to Number 6 and Number 7, both published since the February meeting of the
Editorial Board; the current circulation of the periodical; requests
received for quantity orders for meetings and other purposes; their
reflections on the seven numbers published to date; articles received, but
not yet published, and images collected but not previously used.  The
Board then focused on feature topics and possible articles and authors for
future numbers, as well as suggestions for the several departments that
were included in Numbers 1 through 7: "Voices from the Classroom,"
"Superintendents'  and Principals'  Forum,"  "Student Voices,"
"Responses" to
articles published in On Common Ground,  Book Reviews, and "From the New
Haven Experience."  Finally they reviewed comprehensively the list of
authors who have ever been approached to write for the periodical, with
particular attention paid to those who have not yet submitted a piece for
publication.	
<p>	
During 1996, the circulation of the periodical was
expanded to more than 12,000 individuals nationwide and included the
following, in addition to numerous teachers and administrators at Yale
University and in the New Haven Public Schools: the Chief State School
Officers; superintendents of school districts enrolling 5,000 or more
students; all college and university presidents and chancellors and chief
academic officers; deans and directors of education, continuing education,
and graduate programs at four-year institutions; directors of community
services and governmental relations at four-year institutions; heads of
many corporations, foundations, and professional organizations involved in
education reform; education policy-makers at both the federal and state
levels; members of the print and broadcast media who cover education; and
a growing list of individuals who have asked to receive it.  The
periodical was mailed also to individuals in schools and colleges across
the country with whom the Institute has worked since the inception of its
dissemination activities in the early 1980s.

In addition, a copy of the periodical was included in the registration
folder of all individuals attending the "National Conference on
School-College Collaboration of the American Association for Higher
Education," held in Washington, D.C. in November; and the "National
Conference on Educational Collaboration and Excellence" held at the
University of California at Berkeley in October.  Number 6 was provided in
quantity, for example, to the National Gallery of Art for use in their
summer program for school teachers; to the Washoe County School District
in Nevada for distribution among their curriculum coordinators; to St.
Mary College in Kansas for an advisory council meeting; to the San Diego
County office of Education for a collaborative meeting with area
chancellors and superintendents; to the University of California, Davis
for their "Leadership Institute for School Superintendents"; to the
Lincoln Public Schools in Nebraska for a meeting of the Executive Board of
the American Association of School Personnel Administrators (AASPA); to
the Southern Crescent Professional Education Council for the six school
systems located in the south metropolitan Atlanta area; and to Mayville
State University in North Dakota for a meeting involving campus faculty
and staff, superintendents, and elementary and secondary teachers at MaSU
and Valley City State University.

<h3>Videotape Program</h3>
When in October 1995 the Carnegie Corporation of New York renewed
its support for the periodical, the grant also provided for the production
of a second videotape program on the process of school teachers
participation in the Institute.  A first, short videotape program,
"Teaching on Common Ground," was  completed during 1995.  It is based on
numerous hours of interviews with Institute participants from the
University and the Schools, the Superintendent, principals, and others;
and on videotaping of teachers and students during the 1994 summer Academy
and the previous school year.  This video was previewed by several
audiences, including school teachers on the Institute Steering Committee,
Yale faculty members on the University Advisory Council, and members of
the Special Gifts Commitee, among others.  The response was generally
favorable and encouraged us to believe that additional videotape
productions would be worthwhile.  Many individuals who viewed the first
program suggested, in fact, that the Institute needs a companion video
that explains the structure and process of the Institute in more detail.
Their concern has been that viewers of the short program not conclude that
the highly positive results of Institute participation as depicted in
"Teaching on Common Ground" can be too readily achieved, but rather that
they are the product of an in-depth and long-term engagement among
University faculty members and public school teachers through a structured
process of seminars and curriculum writing. The viewers suggested that the
next production therefore should be more according to a script, and less
in a documentary style.  The first production was approached as a
documentary in order not to appear unduly promotional, but instead to
relate in a seemingly authentic manner the views of participants.
</td></tr><tr><td><i> (picture available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
The first video was distributed in the fall of 1995 to all
the Institute's school Representatives and Contacts in New Haven, and they
showed it throughout their schools in special meetings, regular faculty
meetings, magnet school meetings, and at other events.  They used the
video to heighten the visibility of the Institute in their schools and to
encourage teachers and administrators to view the Institute as being
designed to meet their needs.  The video was employed specifically--and
with apparently good result--to call attention to seminar plans for 1996
and to on-line and printed resources already available from the Institute.
In fact, as mentioned above, the Representatives attributed the unusually
large number of applicants to 1996 seminars in part to the impact of the
video.
<p>		
The next production, with a script written by Thomas R.
Whitaker, will describe the structure and process of the Institute while
it follows a few individual teachers through that entire process.  The
Institute is fortunate that Whitaker agreed to write the script as he has
led more Institute seminars than any other Yale faculty member.  We
selected seven teachers who were willing to devote the necessary time to
the project, and they were interviewed initially during the month
preceding their participation in an Institute seminar.  The video will
follow them from the initial stages of organizing the Institute as they
suggested the seminars they would like the Institute to offer, through
their own application and formulation of a provisional unit topic, through
participation in a seminar and writing a curriculum unit, into their own
school and the actual teaching of the unit developed through the seminar.
In this way, the video will show the Institute from the perspective of
teachers participating in it.

The second video will be designed to supplement the first,
but it will be coherent and complete enough to stand alone.  Ideally, it
will be about 27 minutes in length.  It will address teachers and
administrators in both schools and universities, in New Haven and in other
cities, as well as members of foundations and other funding organizations,
and, more generally, all those who are interested in the future of public
education in the United States.  Video #2 will provide exposition and
narrative that will make clear:
<ul>
<li>The history of the Institute, including its longevity and present
funding
</li><li>			
The organization of the Institute,
including the roles of the director, the Steering Committee, the
Representatives in the schools, the University Advisory Council and
Executive Committee, and the National Advisory Committee
</li><li>			
The process by which seminars are determined each
year, including conversations among teachers and between the director and
University faculty
</li><li>	
The uses of the talks directed to all Fellows of the Institute
</li><li>		
The seminar process, as it combines common reading
with the writing of individual curriculum units
</li><li>		
The process through which curriculum units are planned,
drafted, tested 	in the classroom, and completed
</li><li>		
The uses and results of the curriculum units in the New
Haven schools, with a sampling of student responses
</li><li>		
The benefits that school teachers, Yale faculty members,
and Yale as an institution receive from the Institute
</li><li>		
The role the Institute has played and continues to play in
Yale s interaction with New Haven
</li><li>
The importance of the Institute s approach for
strengthening teaching 	and learning in schools in other cities
</li></ul>
We believe that this video will be meaningful for various
audiences, but especially for New Haven teachers who have never
participated in the Institute and individuals at other institutions who
are exploring the establishment of similar programs.
