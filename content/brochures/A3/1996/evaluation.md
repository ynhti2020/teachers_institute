Numerous evaluations of the Teachers Institute demonstrate
that such collaborative programs can assist schools in specific ways, and
that the results are cumulative.1  As described below, 37 percent of New
Haven secondary school teachers of subjects in the humanities and sciences
have completed successfully at least one year of the Institute.  A number
have participated for two to seventeen years.  An increasing proportion of
current elementary school teachers, who were first admitted in 1990, have
also taken part.

In the fall of 1996, the Institute updated its ongoing
study of New Haven teachers who have been Fellows in terms of the
proportion of eligible teachers from each New Haven school and department
who have participated, the number of times Fellows have completed the
program, and whether Fellows have remained in teaching in New Haven.  This
study showed that, of the 417 individual New Haven teachers who have
completed the program successfully at least once between 1978 and 1996,
three fifths (59 percent) are currently teaching in New Haven.  An
additional thirty (7 percent) have assumed full-time administrative posts
in the school system.  Thus two thirds (66 percent) of all Fellows since
1978 are currently working in the New Haven Public Schools.  These
statistics are particularly encouraging because of the Institute s
determination to involve individuals who will continue to serve students
in our urban school district.

As Table 3 below shows, a considerable proportion of
eligible middle school teachers (37 percent) and high school teachers (37
percent) have participated in the Institute. With respect to the number of
years Fellows still teaching in New Haven have taken part in the
Institute, 40 percent have particpated once, 33 percent have taken part
either two or three times, and 27 percent have participated between four
and seventeen times.  On the other hand, of Institute Fellows who have
left the New Haven school system, 59 percent completed the program only
once, and 31 percent took part two or three times.  Only thirteen
individuals (10 percent) completed the program four or more times. Thus,
as an indication of its cumulative influence in the New Haven school
system and as potential evidence of its effects in retaining teachers in
New Haven the Institute has worked in the most sustained way with those
individuals who have chosen to remain in teaching in the New Haven Public
Schools.
