<tbody><tr><td>Beginning in the fall of 1995, the teachers who serve as the
Institute
Representatives and Contacts for their colleagues canvassed other
teachers throughout New Haven elementary, middle, and high schools to
determine the subjects they wanted Institute seminars to address in
1996. (Please see Appendix for lists of teacher leaders.)  The
Representatives met together twice monthly and communicated
individually with the school Contacts with whom they were responsible
for staying in close touch.<p>
In their evaluations, the 1996 Fellows indicated, as Chart 1
shows, that
the Institute Representative for their school had been helpful in numerous
ways:  by maintaining frequent contact with them, asking teachers for
thei views on seminar subjects for the following year, encouraging and
assisting teachers in the school to apply to the Institute, and promoting
the use of Institute-developed curriculum units in the school.</p>

As a result, almost three fifths (58 percent) of all Fellows said in the end
that they had, while the program was being planned, sufficient opportunity
to contribute possible topics for seminars.  From its inception, a tenet of
the Institute's approach has been to determine its offerings annually in
response to the needs for further preparation and curriculum development
that teachers themselves identify.  In 1996 this process resulted in the
Institute organizing six seminars.

<h3>	Content of the Seminars Offered </h3>
The following overviews of these seminars are based on the
descriptions their leaders provided and the Institute circulated in
advance.
</td></tr><tr><td>
<h4>		Multiculturalism and the Law</h4>
<p>
The United States has a greater diversity than any other
nation on earth--diversity in such matters as race, ethnicity, religion
and
even (with the possible exception of Israel) the proportion of its current
population born in other countries. Nonetheless, during most of our
national history, this country has understood itself to be "one nation"
from our national motto adopted at our founding, <i>e pluribus unum</i>
("from
many, one"), to the popular conception of a "melting pot" which was coined
in response to the extraordinary influx of immigrants in the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This unitary national
self-conception is, however, very much contested today. 
</p></td><td><hr/><i>The United States has a greater diversity than any other nation

earth.</i><hr/>
</td></tr><tr>
<td>
On race matters, many people are now questioning the assumptions that
guided the civil rights campaign culminating in the Supreme Court's 1954
decision in <i>Brown v. Board of Education </i>and congressional enactment
of the landmark Civil Rights Acts of the 1960s the assumptions that
justice demanded the end of racial segregation in all aspects of American
life, and that racial harmony would thereby be promoted. On religious
matters, many people are now questioning the Jeffersonian conviction that
there should be a rigid "wall of separation" between Church and State so
that there sould be no religious qualifications for holding public office
nor state support of any sort for religious practices; openly waged
conflict between religious fundamentalists and others about the "moral
content" of public school curricula is one contemporary indicator of this
dispute. These conflicts on racial or religious issues are not new in this
country; but there are also new forces pressing for recognition of
diversity in areas which have previously been unimaginable-- most notably,
regarding language usage (seeking to displace the once-dominant idea that
English is our sole approved national language) and regarding sexual
preference (seeking to displace the once-dominant idea that
heterosexuality is the sole approved status). These claims are themselves
vigorously contested.

</td></tr><tr><td>		The goal of this seminar was to explore the
competing conceptions of "cultural unity" and "diversity" which are so
passionately contested today. It focused particularly on ways that the law
has been enlisted on one side or the other of this debate and considered
such matters as (1) racial segregation in schools (exploring, for example,
whether current proposals to retain the distinct racial identity of
traditionally Black southern universities deserve different treatment from
the <i>Brown </i>principle condemning all public school race segregation);
(2) race-based affirmative action policies in employment, higher education
or public contracts; (3) religiously based claims to control public school
curriculum in such matters as the distribution of contraceptives or
teaching about sexual preferences, as well as religious claims for
exemptions from public education; (4) legal regulation of family matters
such as trans-racial adoptions and marriage for same-sex couples; (5)
treatment of immigrant populations within the U.S., including language
controversies both in public school bilingual education programs and in
general efforts to enact "English Only" as the official U.S. language;
(6)
issues of diversity in our criminal justice system in matters such as the
role of race in jury selection and in criminal prosecutions such as drug
offenses; (7) the proper role of race, religion or ethnicity in the
construction of voting districts.
</td><td><hr/><i> The goal was to explore the competing conceptions of "cultural
unity" and "diversity." </i>
<hr/>
</td></tr><tr><td>As for the seminar materials, Fellows read judicial opinions and
works by legal scholars and  also materials that would enrich their
understanding of the cultural issues that lie beneath these legal
materials, such as Henry Louis Gates  book <i>Colored People,</i> which
recounts  coming of age  in racially segregated West Virginia; Harlon
Dalton s book <i>Racial Healing, </i>which considers racial stereotypes
and barriers to honest conversation between Blacks and Whites in this
country; and Stephen Carter s book<i> The Culture of Disbelief, </i>which
explores the proper role of religious commitment and practice in our
public life.

<tbody><tr><td><h4>Race and Representation in American Film</h4>
<p>
Motion pictures, one of the preeminent forms of mass
entertainment and cultural representation in 20th Century America, have
engaged questions of ethnicity and race, of cultural communities, and of
interracial interactions on numerous levels.  Classical Hollywood cinema
(1915-1960) can be understood as participating in a conversation among
European-American ethnic groups which had Representatives inside the
industry and were also its targeted audiences in theaters.  African
Americans, Asians and other peoples of color were generally allowed only
to overhear this discourse.  However, alternative film making practices
did spring up outside these structures, particularly within the
African-American community where film makers such as Oscar Micheaux made
feature films from a Black perspective.

Felicia R. McKinnon, Gerene L. Freeman, Ida L. Hickerson, Mary Ellen
Brayton, Martha Savage, Steven F. Gray, and seminar leader Charles
Musser.) </i></font></td></tr><tr><td>
The conversation about race generated by the cinema
changed significantly in the late 1960s with the rise of such documentary
programs as <i>Black Journal </i>and <i>Les Realidades,</i> the popularity
of Black exploitation films (<i>Shaft </i>and <i>Sweet Sweetback s
Badasssss Song)</i> and Bruce Lee as the first Asian American star since
the coming of sound.  Today we are confronted with a New Black Cinema that
has commercial support from Hollywood, an Asian-American cinema (Ang Lee,
Wayne Wang), and a multiculturalism that includes the interracial romance
of Disney Productions (<i>The Jungle Book, Pocahontas)</i> and the
eclectic sports team fighting its way to victory, forging unity across
gender and race (<i>Mighty Ducks, The Big Green).</i>
<p>
The purpose of this seminar was to have a conversation
about race and the cinema, to gain some historical perspective on these
issues, and to speculate on the implications of a new wave of films that
in some respects seems a significant departure from past practice.  What
do they mean for us?  How do these films impact our students?  The hope
was that some of these films would have classroom applications.  But in
any case, Fellows would gain some perspective on what their students see
when they go to the movies.  The seminar consisted of four  clusters  of
three films each, selected from the following possible groupings.

<tbody><tr><td><b>Remaking America: Contemporary U.S. Immigration </b>
<p>
The United States, that "permanently unfinished" society, has once
again become a nation of immigrants.  In this remaking of America,
immigration restrictionists have grown fond of historian Arnold Toynbee s
contention that, "The same elements that build up an institution
eventually lead to its downfall."  In this seminar, Fellows considered a
range of controversial issues, such as whether immigrants are taking jobs
away from native-born Americans; whether they place an unfair burden on
public services; and whether American culture and society can accommodate
the large numbers of "new" immigrants who have arrived since the
mid-1960s.

While many Americans view immigrants as basically poor,
huddled masses, there is actually tremendous variation in the education
and skills that newcomers bring.  Indeed, the most educated <i>and </i>the
least educated groups in the United States today are immigrants.  The
seminar explored how this polarity both reflects differing historical
contexts promoting out-migration and contributes to contrasting modes of
socio-economic incorporation. While the number of new immigrants/refugees
arriving in the U.S. over the last few decades has been unprecedented, the
proportion of foreign-to-native born is moderate as compared to earlier
periods in U.S. history and to the demographic situation in other
industrial nations, such as Germany, France, and Canada.  Where the
contemporary situation in the U.S. <i>is different,</i> is in the ethnic
and racial origins of the immigrant and refugee populations.  The bulk of
newcomers are "people of color" and, as the seminar explored, their very
presence and "identity politics" contest the meanings, categories, and
practices of race in contemporary U.S. society.  Immigration
restrictionists decry newcomers who allegedly refuse to assimilate and are
thus, we are told, weakening the social and cultural fabric of American
society.  The seminar examined this contention as well as competing
theories of the social and cultural incorporation of contemporary
immigrants/refugees (e.g., assimilation, cultural pluralism, ethnic
separatism, transnationalism).

<h4>Environmental and Occupational Health: What We Know; How We Know; What
We Can Do</h4>
<p>
The first half of this seminar focused on our current
knowledge of how people get exposed to hazardous physical, chemical and
biological hazards, how they induce changes in health, and how we study
this relationship.  This was the "basic science" component of the seminar
and  began with discussion about the physical and chemical aspects of
human activity, especially in the workplace.  The following questions were
addressed:  How are the various things around us manufactured?  What
hazrds are created in the process?  The second challenge was to explore
the fundamental principles underlying the interaction of the human body
with these hazards.  This drew in basics of biology and medicine and to
some extent more physics and chemistry, developed to the level of
sophistication consistent with the individual teacher s background and
interest.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>
Once the seminar established the basic elements and
definitions, and felt comfortable with the theory, Fellows explored the
crucial issue of how scientists discover the relationship between these
hazards and the effects they cause.  While this demanded yet more
scientific reasoning, the primary tools were logic and reasoning, as well
as mathematics and statistics.		
</td><td><hr/><i> Fellows explored the crucial issue of how scientists discover

relationship between hazards and the effects they cause.
<hr/></i></td></tr><tr><td>
After the scientific basis for environmental and occupational diseases was
developed, the seminar switched attention to the social issues of
prevention and control.  First, Fellows discussed how the organizations
which create hazards must think and deal with them.  What are the
obligations of these corporations, and where do their true interests lie?
How might we expect them to behave, and how close to that expectation is
their actual behavior?  What role could government play in modifying that
behavior?

</i></font></td></tr><tr><td>
Next the seminar turned to that role of government,
discussing both the history of environmental controls and current debates.
Teachers were asked to role play positions as antithetical to their own as
possible, to force everyone to perceive the multifaceted nature of almost
every issue.  To the fullest extent possible the outstanding issues of our
time dioxin, Persian Gulf Syndrome, mercury and electromagnetic fields for
example were chosen for seminar discussions.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Finally, all controversy aside, the seminar finished with
the role of the individual.  How do we protect ourselves from harm?  What
must we know?  What are we to believe?  What should we teach our children
and when should we teach it?  By this stage in the seminar, the teachers
themselves were in a position to lead the discussion, as they prepared
their final project plans.

<h4>Genetics in the 21st Century: Destiny, Chance or Choice</h4>
The issues can be divided into three areas: what will be
learned from the human genome project, how the information will be used,
and how the public can be educated.
<p>
<i>What is the genome project learning about our genes?
Is there one "human genome?" 
</i></p><p>		
More than 100,000 human genes affect and control aspects
of development, growth, disease, perhaps even personality and behavior.
The structure of many genes has been defined, and we are learning how they
work.  The goal of constructing a map of the human genome is on the way to
being met and ever more genes are being placed on this map.  How does a
genetic map work?  The genome project is already finding some genetic
surprises.  Genes can change in structure in the process of being passed
from parent to child.  Sometimes whether or not a particular form of a
gene expresses itself depends on whether it was inherited from the mother
or the father.
</p><p>
<i>		How will genetic information be used?  Who will be allowed
to know what we each learn about our own genes?</i></p><p>
Many examples of interesting and important issues raise
such questions.  Several genes predispose to the development of cancer.
Should people be screened for these genes?  Employers will want to know
who is at risk for becoming sick and perhaps will want to discriminate
against people based on that information.  Society (that is, an informed
public) will need to decide how this information will be used and who will
have access to it.  Parents may want the genetically perfect child,
instead of just being concerned about recognized diseases.  Will that kind
of genetic engineering be possible or desirable?  Will we be able to "fix"
abnormal genes and cure genetic diseases?

<i>How can the public be educated about the new genetics?  
</i>
</td></tr><tr><td>		The question is important on the individual level
and the
societal level.  People will need to understand genes, how they work and
how they affect health and development to make personal decisions about
genetic testing and genetic treatments.  Understanding the new genetics
will help people to make good public policy decisions, examine laws, make
new laws, and decide how public money will be spent on research and on
public health.  The sooner students learn about genetics in school, the
better equipped they will be to use genetics in the 21st century.  They
may have to educate their parents!  Computer programs, dramatizations,
model building and learning to use electronic information sources were all
employed in the seminar to make this learning easier and more fun.

<tbody><tr><td><h4>		Outstanding Problems in Contemporary Astronomy and
Cosmology
</h4>
Astronomy in general, and Cosmology in particular, have
undergone a revolutionary expansion in the past four decades.  As a
consequence, we currently have a firm grasp on the basic structural and
dynamical properties both of the Universe as a whole, and of its
individual constituents.<p> 
However, as we continue to explore the details of these
properties of the Universe and its components, we sometimes come across
inconsistencies and/or features that do not fit within the edifice of
knowledge that we have slowly and carefully built up.  Although these
difficulties cause discomfort and unwelcome turmoil in the scientific
community, they are not all bad, since they compel us to examine extreme
possibilities that we would not consider otherwise. Thus, when one of
these problems is eventually solved, it advances our understanding of
nature further than what would be accomplished by more conservative
research.
</p></td></tr><tr><td> 
The original intent of the seminar was for Fellows to
discuss some of the outstanding mysteries or controversies in contemporary
Astronomy in general and Cosmology in particular:  the problem of the
missing solar neutrinos; the nature and distribution of dark matter in the
Universe; the discordant determination of the age of the universe from
different techniques, etc.  In order to comprehend the basis of the
various problems, the seminar began with a broad overview of the field of
Astronomy to provide the context necessary to understand the nature of
these controversies.  Subsequently, the seminar format evolved towards
extensive question, answer  and discussion sessions.
</td><td><hr/><i>The seminar focused on our current understanding of our place
within the Solar System, of the Solar System's location within the Milky
Way Galaxy, and some ideas about the origin of the Universe.<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
From these activities, it became clear that the present
controversies in the field were too esoteric, both in terms of the
interests and concerns of the Fellows, but especially with regard to the
interests of their students.  While many youngsters are curious about the
Solar System, the achievements of space vehicles (both manned and
unmanned), interstellar travel, and life in the Universe, they are not
likely to be excited about the nature of "dark matter," or the
discrepancy
between the age of the oldest stars, and the Hubble age of the Universe.
Similarly, educational requirements as stated in various state and
national standards also center around the Solar System, scaling processes,
Kepler s laws, and on terrestrial events related to Astronomy, such as the
seasons and mass extinctions.

As reflected in all the curriculum units that emerged from the seminar,
the seminar therefore focused on our current understanding of our place
within the Solar System, of the Solar System s location within the Milky
Way Galaxy, and some ideas about the origin of the Universe in terms of
the currently accepted Big-Bang theory.

The Fellow's  Application and Admissions Process
</h3>
Having worked with teachers in their respective schools
during the preceding months, the Institute Representatives met on January
9 to receive for distribution in all schools copies of the Institute
application form, brochure, and descriptions of the seminars being
offered.  At this meeting there was a general presentation on the subjects
of the seminars to ensure that all Representatives could accurately
explain to their colleagues the purpose of each seminar.
<p>
The following week the Institute held an open house for
prospective applicants where any teacher might learn more about the
planned seminars from the Representatives and from the seminar leaders who
attended and who conducted discussions in small groups with interested
teachers.  As one Fellow wrote about this process, "This program was a
very positive experience for me, especially with the assistance I had all
along the way with my school's Representative." 
</p></td></tr><tr><td>
One week later, on January 23, the Representatives met to
discuss their progress in working with prospective applicants and to hand
in their own completed applications.  The final application deadline for
teachers applying to the Institute was January 30.  This date was selected
so that teachers would apply in advance of the February school vacation;
in this way the office would have the period of the vacation to process
application materials for the upcoming review, and the review could be
completed during February to provide earliest possible notification to the
teachers who were accepted.

are directly related to school courses that he or she will teach.<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
There are four principal criteria for teachers to be
eligible for consideration as Fellows.  First, the applicant must be a
current New Haven school teacher who will be teaching in New Haven also
during the school year following Institute participation.  Second, the
teacher must agree to participate fully in the program by attending and
coming prepared to all scheduled meetings and by completing research and
meeting due dates in the preparation of an individual curriculum unit.
Third, the teacher must demonstrate in the application that his or her
specific interests are directly related to the seminar as it has been
described by the seminar leader.  Fourth, the applicant must also show
that the seminar and the curriculum unit that he or she proposes to write
are directly related to school courses that he or she will teach in the
coming school year.<p>
In addition, beginning in 1990 we decided to place a firm
limit of no more than twelve teachers in any seminar.  We have believed
that the small size of the seminars is indispensable both for the
collegiality of the Institute experience and for the individual attention
that each teacher s work in progress receives from the seminar leader and
from other teachers in the seminar.  The extraordinary amount of interest
in our 1996 offerings, however, led the Coordinators to reexamine this
policy.
</p></td></tr><tr><td>		During the planning process 114 teachers expressed
interest in participating in one of the seminars to be offered.  By the
application deadline, the Institute Representatives, assisted by the
school Contacts, had obtained applications from 91 elementary, middle, and
high school teachers in the humanities and in the sciences.  This was a 65
percent increase in applicants over 1995.  
</td><td><hr/><i> There was a 65 percent increase in applicants over 1995.

The application form calls for each interested teacher to specify the
subjects and grade levels they teach, the course or courses in which they
plan to introduce the material they study in the Institute, and their
willingness to meet each of the Institute s requirements for full
participation.  The applicants also write a brief essay describing why
they wish to participate in the seminar to which they are applying, and
how the curriculum unit they plan to write will assist them in their own
teaching.  Writing this short essay is, in effect, their first step in the
formulation of a curriculum unit through which they will bring the
material they study from the seminar into their own teaching.
<p>	
In the past, the application teachers submit have been
reviewed by three groups:  school supervisors, seminar leaders, and
seminar Coordinators.  The Public Schools  subject supervisors are given
an opportunity to examine the applications of the teachers they supervise
to determine whether or not each proposal is consistent with, and
significant for, the teacher s own development and for school curricula
generally.  
</p></td></tr><tr><td>		At the same time, the Institute seminar leaders
examine the applications for their relationship to the seminar subject.
This affords each seminar leader the opportunity, as well, to tailor or
enlarge the bibliography for the seminar so that it will address the
specific interests of the teachers who are accepted.  By conducting their
reviews in early February, the school administrators and seminar leaders
are able to provide timely information about any problems they find in the
applications. 
</td><td><hr/><i>For the first time, the applications were reviewed within the
applicant's own school, in keeping with plans to decentralize decisions

</i></td></tr><tr><td>
This year, for the first time, the applications were
reviewed also within the applicant s own school, in keeping with plans to
decentralize administrative functions and decision making within the
school district.  In each case, the Institute s Representative for the
school contacted the school principal to determine who should be involved
in this building-level review.  The intention was to increase awareness
within each school of the projects individual teachers wished to pursue in
Institute seminars and to afford an opportunity for the principal and
other educational leaders to examine the relationship between teachers
applications and school plans.  In this way, the teacher professional and
curriculum development the Institute provides might be connected more
closely to the school s particular needs, as determined within each
school.  As New Haven Public Schools Superintendent Reginald Mayo wrote to
principals, "We believe this is a highly promising way for ensuring that
the assistance that the Institute provides to individual teachers and to
teams of teachers has the best prospects for advancing each school s
academic plans."   Indeed, this was a valuable process.  Not only did it
inform the consideration of each application and provide each applicant
pertinent feedback, but Institute Representatives also reported that, in
many schools, it afforded a significant opportunity for them to talk with
their principal about the Institute.  It also gave principals and
leadership teams direct information on the relationship between teachers
projects and school plans.
</td></tr><tr><td>		As we have done in the past, the Institute formed
a group of teachers who served as Coordinators to assist with the
organization and smooth operation of the seminars.  Each Coordinator
participated as a Fellow in a different seminar, and they met together
weekly with the director.  They also served as an admissions committee.
They met after school on February 6 to conduct a first reading and
discussion of the applications to their respective seminars. They then
contacted individually all teachers whose applications needed to be
clarified or amplified.  On February 15 the Coordinators met again for a
full day, by taking professional leave, for their final consideration of
and decisions on the applications.  Because of the large number of
applicants, the Coordinators had to schedule two additional, lengthy
review sessions.  After much discussion, they decided, for this year only,
to increase the maximum size of the seminars from twelve to fifteen in
order to accommodate as many of the applicants as possible.

considered the findings of the school administrators and seminar leaders
and made recommendations to the director about which teachers the
Institute should accept.  By these means, the Institute seeks to ensure
that all Fellows participate in seminars that are consistent with their
interests and applicable in the school courses they teach.  As a result,
on March 1 the Institute accepted as Fellows 82 New Haven teachers the
largest number in fifteen years 45 in the humanities and 37 in the
sciences.  Consistent with the Institute s aim to serve the largest
possible proportin of all New Haven teachers, 37 (or 45 percent) of the
teachers accepted in 1996 were participating in the Institute for the
first time; 18 of these first-time Fellows were in the humanities and 19
were in the sciences.  A few Fellows were early participants in the
Institute who returned after an absence of numerous years.  On April 29
the New Haven Board of Education recognized the Fellows at its regular
meeting.

<h3>The Fellows Who Were Accepted
</h3>
Fellows came from all but one middle and one high school;
two-thirds of all elementary schools had teachers participating.  The
Institute first admitted elementary school teachers in 1990; this year two
fifths (39 percent) of all Fellows were elementary school teachers.
Almost one third (29 percent) were high school teachers and one third (32
percent) were middle school teachers.  In three cases, teams of Fellows
from a given school took part together in a seminar.  Five schools had
five or more Fellows; twelve schools had three or more.  Thus the
Institute s work this year was spread ever more widely throughout the
school district, while at the same time it was concentrated more
intensively in numerous schools.  Overall, about half of the Fellows were
41-50 years old; 37 percent were younger and 12 percent were older.  As
one Fellow wrote,"Our seminar was composed of a very divergent group of
people, ranging from kindergarten teachers to a Ph.D. teaching high
school.  We also had people who were teaching handicapped and severely
retarded children."   
</td></tr><tr><td>
As Chart 2 shows, one quarter of Fellows (23 percent) had
four or fewer years total experience in teaching.  The Institute attracted
a similar proportion (21 percent) of teachers with 20 or more years total
experience in teaching.  More than a third (39 percent) of the Fellows,
however, had four or fewer years of experience teaching in the New Haven
school system.  Illustrative of the need for the professional development
that the Institute provides, moreover, more than half (55 percent) of all
Fellows have been in their present teaching position four or fewer years;
four fifths (84 percent) have taught in their present position for nine
years or less.  Thus, even though half of the Fellows have 13 or more
years total teaching experience, half have 6 or fewer years experience in
their present position.  This helps to explain why many teachers say they
need to develop their knowledge in subjects they have been recently
reassigned to teach, or curricular materials for students of a different
age or background than the students they have taught before.

<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
Moreover, as in past years and as in the case in the
school system generally many of the 1996 Fellows did not major in college
or graduate school in the subjects they currently teach.  As Chart 3
shows, in no field did all Fellows teaching a subject have a graduate or
undergraduate degree in that subject.  In some fields, notably chemistry,
earth science and physics, no Fellows had a graduate or undergraduate
degree in a field they taught.

Chart 4 shows the subjects Fellows taught in the 1995-1996
year of their Institute participation.  Overall, three fifths (62 percent)
of Fellows in the humanities and four fifths (82 percent) of Fellows in
the sciences had not majored either in college or graduate school in one
or more of the subjects they taught in 1995-1996.
</td></tr><tr><td><i>(chart available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td>		It is understandable, therefore, that 1996
Fellows, when asked about the incentives that attracted them to
participate in the Institute, responded (as Chart 5 shows) that the most
important incentives were the opportunities to increase their mastery in
the subjects they teach (95 percent), to exercise intellectual
independence (96 percent), and to develop curricula to fit their needs
(100 percent) and materials to motivate their students (100 percent).  
</td></tr><tr><td><i>(chart available in print form)
</i></td><td><hr/><i>Among the most important incentives were the opportunities to

</i></td></tr><tr><td>
As past Institute studies have shown, Fellows are in most
respects highly representative of all New Haventeachers.  So, for example,
this year s Fellows, as Fellows before, reflect the gender and ethnicity
of all New Haven teachers, though there are large disparities overall in
the ethno-racial characteristics of New Haven teachers and their students.
(See Table 1)  Similarly, the Yale faculty members who have
led Institute seminars generally reflect the wider faculty at Yale.

<h3>Activities for Fellows</h3>
At the first organizational meeting of each seminar, held
on March 5, the seminar leader distributed an annotated bibliography on
the seminar subject and presented the syllabus of readings that he or she
proposed the seminar would consider.  The Fellows described the individual
curriculum units that they planned to develop.  This afforded the members
of each seminar an overview of the work they were undertaking together and
of the projects they would pursue individually.  The bibliographies both
introduced the seminar subject generally and guided Fellows as they began
research on their curriculum units.  As one wrote,  "The selection of
reference materials to read added richness and depth to the discussions
about [the seminar subject]."   Another said, "Our professor s
bibliography
included texts which were written clearly and were up-to-date so that they
could be easily adapted to our lessons."   Others said:
</td></tr><tr><td><blockquote>
The readings were well-chosen and the length of
assignments was fair.  The selections exposed us to a variety of issues .
. . .This was one seminar I looked forward to each week to discuss issues
brought out in the readings; the amount of money spent on books was
reasonable and each book was a worthwhile investment for me.
<p>
There were many required readings for the class, which I found to be
interesting and informative.  The lectures by our leader were good, and
clarified the readings.  The readings and lectures helped me to grow
intellectually, and to write my unit.

In contrast, some Fellows stressed how demanding they
found the reading to be.  One wrote,  I found that some of the readings
piqued [my] interest while the sheer volume of expected readings
disheartened me.   Another said,  It was difficult to keep up with the
reading, due to my teaching job responsibilities, particularly strenuous
at the end of the year. 
<p>
The seminar leaders also commented on what they perceived
were the Fellows  responses to the weekly readings.  One said:
</p><blockquote>		
Over the duration of the seminar it became clear to me
that most of the teachers were reading the assignments carefully and
critically.  This was reflected in a movement away from distracting
anecdotes, which often characterized the initial sessions, to powerful,
informed discussions of contemporary social problems, such as racism and
unemployment.  Several of the Fellows informed me that they appreciated
the bibliography I provided at the start of the course; it apparently
guided their subsequent reading and research.

individually with their seminar leader to discuss their projects.  The
Institute requires that Fellows schedule at least two such conferences as
part of the unit writing process; many Fellows, however, meet more
frequently with their seminar leader.  At the end of the program, most
Fellows (80 percent) said in the evaluation that they had ample
opportunity to discuss their choice of readings with the seminar leader.
Three seminar leaders commented on how they handled meetings: 
<blockquote>Meetings were 30-45 minutes, discussion covered general areas,
recommendations for reading, clarification of concepts they were confused
or stuck on, and areas particular to their units.  These meetings seemed
just to be expected by all of us, and we just scheduled them.
<p>

had long conversations on the phone.  I met with or talked to the members
at least two times, sometimes three or four.  I usually initiated the
meetings, though there were exceptions. </p><p>
I met with most of the Fellows at least two or three times individually
over the course of the Institute.  I stayed after class most weeks for
approximately one-half hour to discuss problems that individual Fellows
were encountering.  After the submission of the final draft several of the
Fellows asked to revise and resubmit their work.  I sent comments on these
to their home addresses, and each Fellow met with me in my office prior to
submitting his or her final unit.</p></blockquote>

During the period that preceded the regular weekly meetings,
Fellows continued their reading, both preparing for the upcoming seminar
discussions and working toward a brief prospectus of what their final
units would contain.  At the second seminar meeting on April 9, Fellows
submitted this prospectus, presented their revised unit topics, and began
to discuss the common readings.  The regular weekly seminar meetings began
on May 7; thereafter Fellows continued to develop their units in stages,
with a first draft submitted on May 21.  The weekly meetings of the
seminars continued through July 16, with Fellows submitting the second
draft of their units on July 9 and their completed units by August 1.  
<p>
In response to the comments of Fellows and seminar leaders
participating in 1994, the schedule and steps for writing a curriculum
unit were modified to place greater emphasis on the preparation and
revision of the first draft of the unit.  Many felt that the prospectus,
previously required to be submitted in late April, had become somewhat
redundant of the statement of revised unit topic due at the second seminar
meeting held in early April.  Beginning in 1995, Fellows were asked
therefore to submit the prospectus, together with a revised topic of the
unit and a list of appropriate readings, a the time of the second seminar
meeting.  Fellows then had a full six weeks to write a first draft.  The
due date for the second draft was also moved one week later into mid-July
to allow Fellows more time to address the comments they received on that
draft from other Fellows and from the seminar leader.  These adjustments
met with good response in 1995, and the great majority (87 percent) of the
Fellows agreed that unit writing deadlines occurred at the right time in
relation to the school calendar.   The Representatives decided the
Institute would therefore follow a similar schedule in 1996.  Again this
year, a high proportion of Fellows (78 percent) thought the writing
deadlines occurred at the right time.
</p><p>
The Institute attaches great importance to the process through which
Fellows develop their curriculum units, and many Fellows commented in
their evaluations about the various benefits they derived from following
this process.  As one wrote,  The deadlines, though sometimes difficult to
meet, provided the necessary impetus to get the job done.   At the
conclusion of the seminars, most Fellows indicated that the program
schedule (86 percent) and the guidelines for writing a unit (94 percent)
had been useful to them to a great or moderate extent.  As one Fellow
wrote,  "It was very helpful to have handouts with specific deadline
dates,
curriculum writing instructions, and information on available resources."
</p></td></tr><tr><td>
One of the reasons the Institute schedule overlaps the
school year by three months is to provide Fellows an opportunity to try
out with their own students the subject matter and strategies they are
considering including in the curriculum units they are developing.  As one
Fellow wrote,  "I began teaching part of my curriculum unit to my students
at the end of the last school year, and I found the students very
receptive."  A second Fellow commented on this advantage the schedule
affords:
<blockquote>
This year will be especially rewarding because most of my
unit lessons have been developed with many student-planned activities in
mind.  Having already  road-tested  certain lessons with this past year s
class, I m sure that this unit will become one of our favorites for years
to come. </blockquote>

This year about three quarters of Fellows said they tried out the
subject matter (70 percent) and the strategies (77 percent) of their units
in their classroom.  For those who did, most (80 percent) said this
influenced what they included in their final unit.
<p>
During the first two months of the program, which serve as
a reading period, all Fellows also met together on Tuesday afternoons for
a series of talks that were held after school.  As we have done in recent
years, the Representatives decided to invite some current and prospective
seminar leaders to deliver talks.  In this way all Fellows listen to
either an overview or an example of the work their colleagues are pursuing
in other seminars, while learning as well about seminars in which they
might wish to participate in a future year.  In addition, some faculty
members are invited to speak on topics the school Representatives believe
will be of particular interest to many Fellows.  The talks that University
faculty members gave were:  "The Resurgence of Scientific Racism"  by
Rogers
M. Smith, Professor of Political Science;  "Genetics in the 21st Century"
by Margretta R. Seashore, M.D., Professor of Genetics and of Pediatrics;
"Contemporary Migration to the United States: Myth and Reality"  by
Patricia
R. Pessar, Associate Professor of American Studies and of Anthropology;
"As a Woman, As Myself: Gender and the Lyric Voice"  by Marie Borroff,
Sterling Professor Emeritus of English; and "Documentary Film/TV and the
Rise of Multiculturalism, 1968-1975" by Charles Musser, Associate
Professor of Film Studies and of American Studies.

</i></font></td></tr><tr><td>For the past four years, the talks have met with
generally more favorable response than was the case in several prior
years.   They remai at times, however, controversial.  Echoing comments
from those earlier years, one Fellow wrote,  "The talks were, for the most
part, uninteresting and not related directly to my seminar topic.  There
were no Black presenters.  This is my second year, and there were none
last year either."  Another said, "The weakness of the Institute is the
lecture series at the beginning.  Some of the lectures were interesting
but others were very boring and had little to do with the seminar topic
that I was involved in.  I would have liked a lecture on the seminar topic
I was involved in."  Most Fellows, however, saw in the talks the purposes
for which they were organized.  They said that to a great or moderate
extent the talks were successful in providing them intellectual
stimulation (91 percent) and a sense of collegiality and common purpose
among Fellows (77 percent).  Two thirds (68 percent) said the talks were
successful in providing an overview of Fellows  work in the seminars.  The
great majority (85 percent) said the Institute scheduled the right number
of talks this year.  One Fellow wrote,  I found the lecture series to be
as interesting as in the past years.  In other words, very interesting and
informative.    Others said:
</td></tr><tr><td>
<blockquote>
I enjoyed many of the general discussions presented during
the first portion of the Institute.  I especially enjoyed the lecture
entitled  The Resurgence of Scientific Racism  and wished that more time
could have been allotted to the lecture.
<p>
I found the series of  talks  to be interesting and informative.  As a
result of several of the talks, I found myself reading more about the
particular subject.  In this way, the Institute strengthened my resolve to
be a life-long learner.
</p><p>
The series of speakers was fine.  I was much impressed with what was said
at the talks, the following discussions and the follow-up in the seminars.
At first, I questioned the need to participate in the talks segment of the
program.  Although many of the discussions were enlightening, I didn t
quite understand how they fit in with [my seminar].  After, however,
actually attending and actively participating in each talk segment, I
appreciated them.  I found it fascinating to learn of similar mind sets
and differing views and philosophies embraced by my colleagues and Yale
professors.  The talks opened doors for engaging dialogue, developing
relationships, and bringing to light areas often overlooked.</p></blockquote>

As we have also done in recent years, the Institute
scheduled a session on curriculum unit writing on April 30, a week before
the regular meetings of the seminars began.  At the beginning of the
program, as part of their admissions folder, all Fellows received
Institute guidelines and mechanical specifications for preparing
curriculum units, which outline the Institute writing process and the five
steps for Fellows formulating, reformulating, and enlarging their
individual units.  The discussion on April 30 had two main purposes.
First, all the Fellows met together for a general session during which a
panel of Coordinators spoke briefly about following the Institute process
for unit development, considering one s audience, using a computer to
write a unit and put it on-line, using the computer assistance the
Institute provides, and Fellows working together in writing and using
units.  Second, we divided all the Fellows into seminar groups, where each
Coordinator led a discussion of purposes and practices in writing
Institute curriculum units.  This afforded an opportunity for the numerous
first-time Fellows to learn about the guidelines and other aspects of
curriculum unit writing from experienced Fellows.  At the same time, it
encouraged Fellows who have participated before to share their experience,
and it allowed all the Fellows to discuss how the completed volume of
units might display a range of diverse teaching strategies and contain a
standard form of annotation.  By leading these discussions, the
Coordinators also identified themselves as being knowledgeable about the
requirements for, and approaches to, writing curriculum units, so that
other Fellows might seek their advice as they continued developing their
individual units during the remaining months of the program.

As described in more detail in the section on Program
Development, the Institute for the second time this year
offered computer assistance to the Fellows.  For two thirds of Fellows (67
percent) the availability of computer services through the Institute was
an incentive to their participation.  These services were provided by Yale
students working for the Institute and included help with the following:
getting started with computing; word-processing and file handling for the
preparation of curriculum units; setting up e-mail and access to the
Internet; using Institute curricular resources on-line; and using the
Internet in research and teaching.  Help was provided by e-mail, on the
telephone, and in person.  Fellows could meet with computer assistants by
making an appointment in advance to come to a small computer facility the
Institute established adjacent to its main office.  A majority of this
year s Fellows (58 percent) took advantage of this assistance, at least to
some extent.  Most who sought the computer assistants  help did so in
person (46 percent of all Fellows).  Some Fellows sought advice by phone
(28 percent) or by e-mail (10 percent).   Some Fellows who did not use the
computer explained why.  One wrote,"I did not use the computer assistance
because I had no need to.  I have my own computer and am computer
literate."  Another said, "I did not use the computer assistance for
various reasons.  I think that having computer assistance is a great idea.
However, between work, research, and family responsibilities, it was
difficult for me to set aside extra time to use the resources."  One who
made time to work with the computer assistants said, "I did use the
computer assistance because I needed help using the Internet and I do not
yet own a computer."  Others wrote of their advantages of the assistance
they received:
<blockquote>
The computer assistance was valuable to me because it was a learning
experience.  I did not know what was available and the staff was most
helpful.  I will certainly use the network in the future.  The resources
were valuable to my unit.
<p>
The two computer assistants patiently helped us access the Internet and
also they guided us how to access the completed curriculum units
previously submitted to the Institute.
</p><p>
I was glad the computer assistance was available.  I was starting from
ground zero.  I used the Institute computer assistance to get started and
went back for a second session.</p><p>
I found the computer assistance to be very helpful.  I had no knowledge or
experience on using the Internet and needed basic instruction in
connecting and working with the software needed.  I found the technicians
to be very helpful.  They explained in detail the steps I needed to take

explain things in terms that were easily understood by individuals with
limited computer skills.</p></blockquote>

director, which were held on the day after seminar meetings, they
discussed the progress of each seminar and gained an overview of the
program.  In addition, the Coordinators met with the seminar leaders
immediately before the program began to provide them information about the
teachers who had been accepted and to begin to define, in practical terms,
what their role would be in assisting with the conduct of the seminars.		
</td></tr><tr><td>
Both the seminar leaders and Fellows acknowledged in their
evaluations the essential role of the Coordinators.  In the final
evaluations, most Fellows (87 percent) agreed with the statement that the
Coordinator had provided teacher leadership without diminishing the
collegial rapport within the seminar.  Overall, almost all Fellows said
the Coordinators helped them by facilitating discussion of Fellows  work
in progress (90 percent), and by providing information about guidelines
and deadlines for unit writing (99 percent) and about use of University
facilities (97 percent).  Few Fellows found the Coordinators unhelpful in
any respect.  As two Fellows wrote:
<blockquote>
Our seminar Coordinator did a fine job of maintaining contact with
Fellows, serving as a connection between seminar leader and all Fellows,
keeping us informed of Institute requirements and responsibilities,
helping to maintain lively discussions in seminar.  The Coordinator was
highly supportive of the Fellows. 
<p>
The Coordinator kept in regular contact with me and was always available
to answer questions about anything about the Institute.</p></blockquote>
For one Fellow, the Coordinator s and other Fellows  supportive
assistance was apparently crucial:
<blockquote>
If it wasn t for my seminar Coordinator, other members of our team, and a
wonderful friend who s been doing the Institute for the last several
years, I probably would ve given up.  However, because of their support, I
persevered and I must say that my experience was more enjoyable than I
initially anticipated. </blockquote>
The Coordinators  role also assists the seminar leader and helps
to remove the leader from a hierarchical relationship to the Fellows.  As
one seminar leader said,  I greatly enjoyed collaborating with my seminar
Coordinator who was highly professional and supportive. 
<p>		
To maintain current information on the program and to
address any problems that arose, the Institute director met monthly with
the seminar leaders as a group.  This also afforded the seminar leaders,
four of whom were conducting an Institute seminar for the first time, an
opportunity to talk with each other about their approaches to, and
experiences in, their seminar.

<h3>Rewards for Fellows</h3>
The seminars have always been regarded as the core collaborative
experience of the Institute, and Fellows  comments about the seminars are
invariably rich and positive. In a typical statement  one Fellow said:
<blockquote>
The seminar was an excellent group.  Our readings and
discussions were timely, relevant and very enlightening.  The topics were
pertinent to all our curricula and experiences, as well as our future
classroom needs.  The guest lecturers added a personal touch and an
additional perspective to the readings.</blockquote>

Seminar leaders described their seminar in general terms:
<blockquote>		
The format of the seminar started with a couple of introductory lectures
followed by extensive question and answer and discussion sessions.  I
found this format useful in that it allowed me to focus on the Fellows
needs and interests rather than on my own ideas of what is interesting and
important. 
<p>
Our seminar was very interactive.  Most Fellows contributed ideas and
tried to balance general questions with ones specific to their units.
Some were more comfortable in the group than others in the beginning, but
a real group spirit developed within the first few meetings.
</p><p>
The seminars generally revolved around an in-depth discussion of the
readings and some brief, supplemental lecturing.  I very carefully
selected readings that would generate debate and structured the course so
that our ability to discuss issues in an informed manner would evolve
throughout. In contrast to my Yale seminars, occasionally Fellows went off
on tangents an I had to attempt to redirect the discussion.  On the other
hand, I enjoyed discussing . . . matters with adults who often expressed
more passion and compassion than my Yale undergraduates, who are often
loathe to lose their cool in front of their peers.  		
</p><p>
I have enjoyed my previous seminar experiences, but this session was a
particular delight.  More than in my previous seminars, this subject
matter was more vividly personal for each of the Fellows because of their
powerful views about and experiences of racial discrimination in our
society, and they and I both felt more confident about their  independent
authority  and knowledge compared to mine.  Thus we had wide-ranging and
rich discussions in the seminar which were illuminating and educational
for me and, I believe, for the Fellows too.</p></blockquote>
A theme in Fellows  comments this year, as in many past years, was the
appreciation and understanding they gained of their own and other cultures
as a result of what they read and the interaction they had with Fellows of
different backgrounds.  As one Fellow wrote, "Our discussions allowed us
all to share opinions and we learned from each other.  Our backgrounds
were diverse and our leader had great respect for that."  Another said, "I
feel that I gained a new and deeper appreciation and respect for people of
various cultures."  Two Fellows wrote:  
<blockquote>
Not only did I enjoy the instructor, but the mix of
teachers in the seminar was mentally and educationally stimulating as
well.  There were variations in everything from grade level to ethnic,
socio-economic, and environmental backgrounds.  This made for some very
interesting discussions in that it allowed us to see and accept
differences as well as provided us with opportunities to observe some of
the ways in which we were alike (standing firm on the same issues).  In an
age when people are divided on so many matters it was satisfying to
observe a level of harmonious spirit.  
<p>
The Institute had several strengths this year.  First, the Institute
brought together teachers from various backgrounds which allowed me to
meet, exchange ideas and socialize with people I might not usually meet.
Second, it gave seminar Fellows a chance to discuss the topic of race in
an intellectual atmosphere.  While our debates were sometimes heated, I
think we all gained an appreciation on how sensitive we need to be on this
issue and that we must teach our students to be just as sensitive.
</p></blockquote>		 
As has been the case since the Institute s inception, its participants and
staff are still sometimes asked whether the co-professionalism among Yale
faculty members and New Haven school teachers, for which the program is
widely known, is authentic.  The collegiality on which the Institute is
founded is perhaps best illustrated by the mutual respect between Fellows
and seminar leaders that the seminar experience engenders.  The comments
they made this year in this regard, including some already cited above,
are representative.  As one seminar leader wrote, "By this point [mid-way]
in our seminar, moreover, we had come to such a spirit of honesty and good
will that our discussions had become wonderfully open and mutually
educational."
</td></tr><tr><td>		
In turn, Fellows expressed their respect for their Yale colleagues.  In
typical comments, several wrote:
<blockquote>		
The seminar leader was friendly, likeable, and provided us with
stimulating discussion topics.  He allowed us the freedom of expression
and even dissent, which proved to be quite engaging.  There was never a
moment where I felt alienated for the ideas that I possessed.
<p>
The seminar leader is an honest, open man who offers his views and listens
to Fellows  points of view.  He is intrigued by others  views at times and
allows himself to grow from the new exposure.  As a leader he was
comfortable to be with.
</p><p>
The seminar leader provided us with very useful and practical information.
He was both informative and stimulating, allowing ample time for analysis
and discussion.  His candor and sense of humor was refreshing.  He
challenged us to view a problem in its entirety instead of focusing on the
issues we felt most comfortable with thus allowing us to expand our
understanding of the problem and the possible solutions. 
</p><p>
Really what the professor achieved was one of the best achievements that
we could ask of any professor in an institute to truly stimulate and
motivate us to learn more for ourselves.
</p><p>
I was very pleased with the professionalism and respect that was given to
me by [my seminar leader].  Our seminar was a model for cooperative
learning.  The teachers were empowered to voice their needs and concerns
[and the seminar leader] responded to the concerns and made adjustments to
her lectures to meet the needs of the teachers.  Such cooperation and
respect made the course very enjoyable and profitable to me.

The seminars afford Fellows an otherwise too rare
opportunity to talk and work with other teachers across the artificial
boundaries that often separate grade levels, schools, and disciplines.
Many Fellows this year spoke of the value of the Institute for them in
these respects.  One said simply, "The interaction between NHPS teachers
and the seminar leader as well as the interaction among the NHPS teachers
was super!!"  Another wrote,  As a first time Fellow,"I found many
strengths in the Institute.  Foremost, it provided an excellent forum for
teachers to work, collaborate, and converse with colleagues on a variety
of professionally related topics."  Others wrote:

the best teachers in the New Haven school system.  I realized that there

The most positive aspect of the seminar was the interaction with other New
Haven teachers.  Discussing seminar topics and school-related events
definitely heightened my sense of belonging to the New Haven School
System.  I was pleased to see so many other teacherswho wanted to improve

The interactions with other teachers was exceptional.  Talking to other

be invaluable.

The interaction in the group was at a high professional level.  There were

the reports of colleagues who had the opportunity of testing their
curriculum units during the period.

<h3>From Seminar Subject to Curriculum Unit
</h3>
Each Institute seminar must balance the complementary and
inseparable but at times competing demands for studying generally the
seminar subject and developing specifically applications of that knowledge
for school classrooms.  Each seminar approaches these demands somewhat
differently as seminar leaders strive to strike an appropriate balance.
</td><td><hr/><i> A sizeable majority of Fellows said that there had been a good
balance between general study of the seminar subject and work in progress
on their units.<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
In the end, a sizable majority of this year's Fellows (76 percent) said
that there had been a good balance in seminar between general study of the
seminar subject and Fellows  work in progress on their units. For some
Fellows, in fact, making connections between the seminar and their
classroom seemed natural, at times effortless.  As one wrote, "A good pace
was maintained throughout the seminar period, with all sessions being
equally valuable for support of the writing process and for maintaining
active interest in the seminar."  For some others, more time spent
discussing work in progress on the units would have been beneficial, and
the larger than usual size of the seminar tended sometimes to limit such
discussion.  One Fellow wrote, "This year's large group made for less
cohesiveness and collegiality.  The work in progress was limited new
teachers, as well as seasoned teachers, had problems adjusting to a larger
audience."  Another said:

In our seminar this year, there was not enough time for all the
participants to present their units before the final draft was submitted.
For a few teachers who were able to do their presentations there was again
very little time for comments, suggestions and open discussions of the
units.  I think teachers learn more from each other than from reading
books alone.  In future seminars, I suggest that sufficient time should be
allotted to discussing our individual units to get input from Fellow
teachers. 
</blockquote>
</td><td><hr/><i> "Teachers learn more from each other than from reading books
alone." <br/> -Institute Fellow
<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
Responses such as these probably argue for the Institute returning
in 1997 to the limit of no more than twelve Fellows in any seminar.
<p>
As mentioned above, the New Haven teachers who
participated as Fellows completed their curriculum units by August 1.
Their units were then compiled in a volume for each seminar, and in
October the volumes were deposited in the libraries of all elementary,
middle, and high schools so that New Haven teachers whether or not they
have been Fellows might use them in their own teaching.  As in the past,
the Institute prepared a Guide to the new units Fellows wrote, based on
synopses of the units by the authors and their recommendations of the
grade levels and school courses to which their units apply. 
</p><p>	
The Institute also updated the Index of all the 1,024
curriculum units contained in the 115 volumes of units the Institute has
published since its inception in 1978.  The Index and Guide, too, were
deposited in all school libraries and distributed to the teachers who
serve as Institute Representatives for the schools.  A full set of the new
curricular resources was provided to numerous school district
administrators who have responsibility for curricula systemwide.  At the
same time, the Representatives conducted an inventory to ascertain whether
each middle and high school has a complete set of all 115 volumes of units
and whether all elementary schools have each of the volumes that their
teachers believe are applicable at those grade levels.  
</p><p>
Although the Institute has, from the outset, furnished
each middle and high school a set of every year s units and although
elementary schools have been encouraged for the last seven years to
request any units their teachers might use a survey in 1994 revealed that
there were gaps in the unit collections in a number of schools.
Maintaining a library set of units has proved most difficult in those
schools that do not have a full-time librarian or, in some cases, even a
library.  In 1993-1994, the Institute therefore sought to determine the
best location for Institute material to be deposited in every New Haven
school, and in 1996 it continued to supply units missing from any
collection, insofar as the volumes were still in-print.  As described
below (page 59), we also pursued the creation of an electronic version
that makes the Institute s curricular resources more widely accessible. 
</p></td><td><hr/><i>The volumes were deposited in libraries of all schools so that
New
Haven teachers--whether or not they have been Fellows--might use them.<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
Both seminar leaders and Fellows commented favorably on
the units produced this year.  One seminar leader wrote, "I was pleased
with the seriousness of the Fellows  approach to their units; and it
seemed to me that each of them could serve as vehicles in their classrooms
for much useful discussion."  Others wrote:
<blockquote>
All of the Fellows drew successfully on the readings assigned in the
seminar.  In most cases a fair amount of additional research went into the
preparation of the unit; an a few clearly put a great deal of effort into
researching their unit topics.  
<p>
Some Fellows came in with a fairly detailed plan of what they wanted to
do, based on a previous teaching unit or other activity.  They refined and
expanded their ideas.  Some came in with only an idea and they have
developed it, expanded their understanding of [the seminar subject] and
the issues they wanted to present, and really developed over the course of
rewriting and refining the drafts.  Nearly all have moved substantially in
their understanding of [the subject].  The range of imagination has been
wide, and the ability to relate to the group of students they are teaching
obvious.
</p></blockquote>
Fellows also commented, in ways as diverse as their own classrooms, on the
value of the units they prepared. One wrote:
<blockquote>		
I would like to emphasize the published curriculum unit as being a strong
motivating factor for taking the Institute course.  Therein lies the
strength, in my opinion, of the Institute.  Although no small task, I have
found my units to flow quite naturally as I begin to put them together.
The finished products have given me a great sense of accomplishment.

<h3>Results for Participants</h3>
As in past years, Fellows in 1996 spoke of the results of their
Institute participation especially in terms of intellectual growth and
renewal.  Just as the opportunity to increase mastery of the subject one
teaches was an important incentive for most Fellows (82 percent) to take
part in the Institute, almost all (99 percent) said that they had gained
knowledge of their subject and confidence to teach it by participating in
their seminar.  Only one Fellow differed with the statement that the
seminar helped him or her grow intellectually and professionally.
<p>
As one Fellow wrote, "It was good to be with other
teachers who were actively trying to make their teaching more interesting
and current.  The best part was that I felt like I was using my brain
again.  I was just not studying only 7th and 8th grade material."  Another
said, "The information I received in the seminar, as well as my own
research, has helped me professionally as well as in my development as a
critical thinker generally."  Two other Fellows wrote:

<blockquote>
The Institute became a springboard for me to get back in
the classroom and realize the worth that I can contribute to intelligent
conversation, while continuing to challenge my never-ending thirst of
knowledge through research and lectures as well.
<p>
At first I had ambivalent feelings in pursuing this seinar because I felt
inadequate and "rusty"  after being away from a university setting for
quite a number of years.  Also I dreaded the thought of meeting deadlines
for papers and long lists of readings.  At any rate, all these
apprehensions were overshadowed when the seminar was in full swing because
every Tuesday afternoon I was looking forward to another two hours of
intellectual discussion with my fellow teachers and seminar leader.  There
was always something new to discuss.  In spite of our opposite views and
differences in opinions, the "mental exercise" was healthy and there was
always excitement.
</p></blockquote>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Numerous Fellows also described the Institute experience
as having increased their professional confidence and morale.  As one
Fellow said, "The Institute recognizes that often times teachers are
undervalued and underestimated by parents, administrators, and even
students.  The Institute allows teachers to feel a part of something
worthwhile." Two Fellows wrote:

enthusiastic about returning to school in the fall.  I feel that the
development of my unit allowed me to tailor reading and writing activities
to suit the needs of my students.  The unit gives me a solid foundation on
which to begin my year. 
</p></blockquote>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Fellows spoke, too, of the access to Yale facilities they
had gained from participation.  From the Institute s inception, all
Fellows have been full members of the University community, listed in the
directory of faculty and staff, and granted use of facilities and services
across the campus.  For most Fellows (89 percent) access to Yale's
academic facilities such as the library was an incentive for their
participation, and three fifths (60 percent) reported that membership in
the Yale community had been greatly or moderately useful to them.  As one
Fellow wrote, "I really feel that the selection of lecturers and the
access to the Yale community far outweighed any weaknesses that I could
ever possibly think about."  Another said, "The resources at Yale were
also most valuable.  The tours of libraries helped greatly and the Yale
staff was also there to answer questions."  Another wrote:
<blockquote>
The Institute puts New Haven teachers in direct contact
with the Yale community, which offers a kind of potential symbiosis for
developing pedagogy that is relevant to students with respect to the
community they live in, and with respect to the demands of higher
education.  Lastly, Yale offers a great deal by way of its
facilities--libraries, computer center, etc.
</blockquote>			
Nor do Fellows see the results of the Institute as being
limited to their own classrooms, or even to teachers who have participated
directly in seminars.  Every single Fellow said that he or she plans to
encourage and assist other teachers in using the unit he or she prepared;
half said they plan to do so with four or more other teachers.  Fellows
this year provided numerous and various accounts of the more extended
influence the Institute has had, and will have, for themselves and their
schools.  One said, "The concepts of the Institute are enforced when the
school is developing its Comprehensive School Plan for the year."  Others
wrote:
<blockquote>
Through two of our teachers having taken a film seminar in
1995, we now incorporate video and film more into the English and history
departments, as well as part of a weekly after school academy activity.
Through the relationship established with other Fellows, there is more
inter-school networking at the high school level.
<p>
After sharing the unit with several other teachers who did not participate
n an Institute seminar, they too are anxious to work with the unit to do a
collaborative project.  The students therefore will get added benefits
from teachers "talking the same talk." 
</p>
<p>
I am on the Curriculum Committee at my school.  I believe that my
involvement with the Genetics seminar will broaden my awareness in the
sciences.  I feel that we will be able to expand the curriculum to include
a variety of topics that up to now had not been thought of or addressed.
</p><p>
Our school is focusing on creating Science/Social Studies thematic units.
My involvement will help others to focus on clear objectives and
strategies for developing and evaluating these units.  It will also help
in the collaborative efforts, across grade levels, to integrate curriculum
aligned with national, state, and district goals.

Each year we are attentive to the responses of both first-time and
veteran participants because, on the one hand, we want a high proportion
of New Haven teachers to become Fellows and, on the other, want the
Institute to become a regular part of Fellows  professional lives.  Both
groups cite their own rewards.  One first-time Fellow wrote, "I have
always wanted to participate in the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, and
I am very pleased that I finally did.  I met a lot of fellow teachers from
other schools.  The class itself was very rewarding and provided me with a
new outlook on the subject."  Another wrote, "I received a great deal of

in past seminars."

For returning Fellows, the rewards of participation do not appear to
diminish over time, as the experience becomes cumulative, and not
repetitive or redundant.  In fact, at least some teachers report that the
benefits increase as one has more experience as a Fellow.  Five wrote:
<blockquote>
My curriculum writing was a more pleasurable experience
than last year s inaugural unit, mostly because I knew what was expected
and had a better sense of the time frame for each deadline.  I also felt
that it was easier to construct the unit, after knowing what the Institute
called for, as far as structure was concerned. 
<p>
To me the Institute is as strong as it has ever been and it continues to
provide the expertise that is needed for instructors in the New Haven
School System to work together and develop materials to enhance the
curriculum of the subject areas.

I have participated in the YNHTI many times.  My prior participation has
been enjoyable.  It has been a way of growing and keeping current in
subject content.  The fellowship with colleagues has been more than
inspirational.  The professors have really done a super job of helping the
participants (Fellows) to maintain professionalism.  Knowledge is power
and the process lends itself to the growth teachers need to be
professionals.

Seminar leaders, too, speak of what they gain from
participation not only in terms of their involvement in public education
and the University s home community, but also in terms of their own
scholarship and teaching.  Presenting what they wrote in their evaluations
is especially worthwhile because the Institute is often asked what are the
incentives and rewards for Yale faculty members who participate.  Seminar
leaders said:
<blockquote>
The experience has broadened my view of the community.
The Fellows ask some very basic questions, answers to which I just take
for granted.  Having to answer them clearly made me look at some very
basic concepts in a detailed and precise way concepts I have not thought
about in that way for a while.  That was useful for my own teaching, and
gave me some new pedagogical ideas.
<p>
Another positive aspect was to witness the development and implementation
of some curriculum units based on the seminar, which produced excitement
for the Fellow, his/her pupils, and for other members of the school.
Finally, some of the Fellows stated at the end of the seminar that the
experience had enriched their life and drastically changed the way they
view science in general, and [the seminar subject] in particular.  These
feedbacks make any effort worthwhile.  
</p><p>
While this seminar did not contribute directly to my scholarly work, it
was fabulously stimulating personally, and I think represents an important
level of contribution for Yale faculty.  It has certainly expanded my
horizons and sense of involvement in this community.

<tbody><tr><td><h3>Benefits for Students
</h3>
The ultimate purpose of the Institute is not only to strengthen
teaching in New Haven s public schools, but also in this way to improve
student learning throughout the schools.  The Institute intends to serve
students at all achievement and performance levels, and Fellows often
write their units for students at more than one level.  In fact, a similar
proportion of Fellows reported that they designed their new curriculum
unit for their "least advanced" students (61 percent), as designed their
unit or their "most advanced" students (59 percent).  Ninety-two percent
of Fellows designed their unit for "average" students.  The plans of four
Fellows illustrate the wide range of unit use in the schools:

I believe my unit will have a big effect on my teaching
next year.  Since I intend to use my unit to get marginal students
interested in college, I will begin the school year with it.
<p>	
My fourth-grade students will learn about the lives and music of
immigrants...in order to develop a more responsible behavior and
respectful attitude towards all peoples in our society.  They will gain
knowledge of what it means to be an immigrant, why people left their
countries, what was special about their countries, and how they adapted to
their new home.  The students will increase their understanding of
geography, history, and languages, and expand their comprehension of these
cultures through the different types of music from the Caribbean.
</p><p>I feel this curriculum unit and my participation in this Institute will
have a very positive effect on the blind and visually impaired students
that I teach.  This project allowed me to explore and research an area
that is greatly needed by my students.  It will provide them with the
information they need to understand genetics and their personal genetic
disorder.  In addition, their sighted peers will also have an opportunity
to learn about genetics, how traits and disorders are passed from
generation to generation and about genetic handicaps. It also will allow
them to understand that they are very alike and at the same time very
unique.  It will be a good introduction to handicapping disorders and will
introduce them to understanding the handicapped people they encounter.
</p><p>
In this coming year, I will be teaching this unit to my class of students
with special needs.  I believe that my science class will be the beginning
of an increased science curriculum at my school.  I will be exposing my
class to a subject that prior to my involvement with Yale, had not been
explored at my school for students with severe disabilities.
</p></blockquote>
To attempt to gauge the impact of this year s units in New Haven
classrooms, we asked Fellows about the number of students to whom they
planned to teach their new unit, and on how many days.  Half of the
Fellows responded that they would teach their unit to at least 55
students.  The chart below illustrates the length of time they planned to
teach the unit.  For all Fellows, then, the unit is a significant part of
their teaching plans.

Fellows this year were optimistic about the responses they
anticipated receiving from their students to the material they had studied
and developed in the Institute.  Importantly, most Fellows this year (93
percent) agreed that, as a result of Institute participation, they have a
higher expectation of their students  ability to learn about the seminar
subject.  Almost two out of five Fellows (37 percent) strongly agreed with
that conclusion.  Fellows spoke about the ways their own enthusiasm for a
subject would motivate students, and how they planned to involve students
more actively in classroom learning.  They wrote:
<blockquote>
My students should benefit because I believe the
curriculum I developed is more stimulating, more organized and well
thought out than before.  The unit is student-oriented, that is, written
to be read by students as well as teachers, with thought-provoking
questions and activities that will turn students on to learning.  
<p>
My participation in the Institute has afforded me the opportunity to
develop creative an thought provoking subject matter for my students.  It
has also allowed me the opportunity to present students with a
differentiated curriculum that develops higher level thinking skills.
</p><p>
My Institute experience has emphasized allowing students to work in
smaller groups, do research, share insights with one another, and write
coherently and persuasively.  These convictions have been buttressed
during the summer; I return to school believing that we must continue to
infuse these methods and skills into the school curriculum to a higher
degree than in the past.
</p><p>
Teaching students to recognize and appreciate our various cultures and
their impact on society is something that s very important.  Having
completed this unit I am better qualified to teach the subject matter and
can direct students to further inquiry.
</p><p>
This seminar I participated in hit a home run because it addressed the
student population I am currently teaching.  The readings and discussions
we had in class enabled me to understand my students better, plan out
lessons and incorporate strategies of effective learning experiences for
my students who have diverse cultural, ethnic and racial background.
</p></blockquote>

We also asked Fellows who had participated in the Institute in prior years
to report on student response they had actually observed when teaching
units they had developed previously in the Institute.  Their comments were
very much in the same vein as the results Fellows expected to achieve with
their new units.  Fellows wrote:
<blockquote>
My prior participation has affected my students in very positive ways.
The Institute experience has allowed me as a teacher to create units that
are student-centered.  By this I mean that topics and activities I choose
tend to be ones that I feel will motivate my students to be better
students and more informed about issues.  For example, in almost every
unit I have developed, there are debates, role-plays, mock trials or some
other activities oriented toward making learning fun, involving students
in the process of learning.  The Institute process is significant, because
there are other teachers who know what works in their classrooms and are
willing to share insights with me.  My current students seem to enjoy the
materials even more than my students did a decade ago.  Invariably, when
graduates return to visit, and we talk about classroom experiences they
remember, it is Institute learning activities and projects that often come
to mind as significant ones.

Again, as I have experienced in the past, I believe that my curriculum
unit will be highly motivating, both to me as a teacher and to my students
who will participate in the unit this coming school term.  My units in the
past have had nothing but positive effects in terms of stimulating my
children in the learning process across all curriculum areas.  I thrive on
creativity in my teaching experiences in the classroom and that is what my
units have been able to offer motivation through creative teaching.
<p>
This school term, I planned a special student-parent day where the
children presented their finished projects from my curriculum unit.  Along
with parents and students, Dr. Mayo and my principal were present for the
program.  I really did not anticipate Dr. Mayo to stay more than a few
minutes.  However, to the delight of myself and the children he stayed for
the hour program, giving very positive comments at the end of the
presentation.  I have had nothing but positive feedback whenever my units
were presented in a public program.

With  regard to the application of my curriculum unit in school, my 8th
grade writing students collaborated on writing a murder mystery play
entitled,  "The Mysterious Case of the Tarantula s Bite,"  that involves
the
audience in solving the case.  I collaborated with another 5th-grade
theater teacher, and our students performed the play for three other
5th-grade classes.  The play takes place in the library and is intended to
introduce 5th graders to the various aspects of the library and cataloging
systems by searching for clues.  Our production was a great success.

I taught my '95 unit--it was wonderful!  I enjoyed having something more
engaging to teach in the middle of the year. It was a much needed break
from the regular reading program.  My students were really happy with the
books provided to my classroom!

<h3>Participants  Conclusions Overall</h3>
We asked Fellows about the extent to which several features of the
Institute had been useful to them.  As shown in Chart 8 below, very few
Fellows said that any aspect of the Institute had not been useful.  In
fact, with the exception of the lecture series and membership in the Yale
community, no fewer than three quarters of Fellows said that each aspect
of the Institute had been useful to a great or moderate extent.  Half or
more responded that favorably to the lecture series (50 percent) and
membership in the Yale community (60 percent). They rated most favorably
the knowledge they gained, their seminar leader, the interaction with
other Fellows, Institute guidelines for writing a unit, and the program
overall.  
</td></tr><tr><td><i> (chart available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
For their part, seminar leaders reached the following
general conclusions about the Institute this year:
<blockquote>
Overall this has been a terrific personal experience.  I think the results
will be mixed, but that a substantial leap forward has occurred in the
challenge to upgrade awareness of children about the [seminar subject],
and in scientific literacy generally I feel even more confident that I ve
had a positive impact on these fine teachers.
</blockquote>
</td></tr><tr><td><i>(picture available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><i>The seminar on "Environmental and Occupational
Health." (Seminar leader Mark R. Cullen.)
</i></font></td></tr><tr><td>
<blockquote>
I think the Institute is a wonderful force for continued learning for
teachers; it is a model for continuing education because there is a
product at the end and the learning is very interactional and "hands-on." 
<p>
I certainly would tell other faculty members about the positive aspects of
the experience--getting to know the community better, teaching fellow
teachers and fellow adults.  I felt that I began to have a sense of what
was going on in the public schools, which I feel was important.  I think
it is an important thing for Yale to be doing and that the faculty should
support that.  I d also have to tell them that my involvement with the
Institute too a tremendous amount of time--far more than teaching summer
school.  Teaching at the Institute is a great honor, and should be
considered in that light.  Seminar leaders deal with real, down-to-earth
people who are trying to help our society in a grass-roots kind of way.
The future of our country is going to be shaped by what goes on in the
nation s public schools as much as in its universities.  It is one of the
most important things that Yale and Yale faculty can do.</p></blockquote>

At the end of a long journey, I am more convinced than when I began that
the Institute is a wonderful accomplishment for New Haven, Yale, and all
its participants.  As a member of the Yale faculty I enjoyed the
opportunity to bring my passion for my subject matter to another academic
community.  I am pleased to have collaborated with New Haven teachers to
ensure that more students have an enlightened view of the opportunities
and challenges that lay ahead as we become an increasingly multiracial,
multicultural nation.

Finally, we asked Fellows to sum up their overall conclusions
about the strengths and weaknesses of the Institute.  Their general
observations presented here complete the discussion of the Institute s
1996 program for Fellows.  
<blockquote>
My seminar group and leader were wonderful.  It was like a
warm family where opinions were expressed openly and confidently.  I
really enjoyed it and would hope to participate again in the future.
<p>
I felt personally there was a lot of healing that took place during the
seminar; feelings of hurt and anger were expressed openly and others were
very supportive and understanding.  In sum, one of the best seminars I
have attended.  If offered again, I would make time to participate.
</p><p>
The strength of the Institute was the organization and professionalism in
which the Institute was run.
</p><p>
Having been my first curricular unit, the whole experience has been very
exciting.  From the first phone call telling me that I was accepted, to
the lectures, to the seminar meetings, to all the reading and the writing
for the final unit, I have really enjoyed coming to the meetings and
discussing with other teachers our theme of study.
</p><p>
My Institute seminar experience was:  an exhausting, time-consuming
process involving much discipline and hard work;  an excellent opportunity
for intellectual stretching and professional development;  a challenging,
motivating time of risk-taking discussions and broadening perspectives,
leading to understanding and tolerance;  an awakening; energizing;
wonderfully stimulating and rewarding;  time well-spent, very well-spent.

In their evaluations, every single Fellow said he or she intended to
participate (84 percent), or might participate (16 percent), in the
Institute in one or more future years.  
<p>
In July and August the Institute identified the 71
teachers who would serve during the 1996-1997 school year as the Institute
Representatives and Contacts for their schools.  Representatives were
selected according to the recommendations of the teachers who served as
seminar Coordinators and conversations they had with individuals who have
served as Representatives in the past, other Institute Fellows, and in
some cases school principals.  Because the Representatives who served
during the 1995-1996 school year were widely regarded as effective, we
sought a high degree of continuity of Representatives.

</i></font></td></tr><tr><td>
At the same time, we slightly increasedthe size of the
Representatives group, (which had been expanded last year by almost half)
from 23 to 24 school Representatives.  These Representatives were well
distributed across New Haven schools with nine (38 percent) representing
elementary schools, eight (33 percent) representing middle schools, five
(21 percent) representing high schools, and two (8 percent) representing
transitional schools.  Whether or not they have a Representative, all
schools had one or more Contacts to serve as a conduit for information to
and from the Institute throughout the school year.  The main difference
between the Representatives and the Contacts is that the former attend
meetings every other week from September to March, receive an honorarium
for this work, and agree in advance to participate in the program they are
planning; Contacts, on the other hand, perform many of the same functions
but are not required to participate in bi-weekly meetings or to commit
themselves to Institute participation.  Through the Representatives and
Contacts, the Institute ensures that all teachers throughout the school
district may have an effective voice in shaping a program of curricular
and staff development in which they will then have the opportunity to take
part. 
<p>
The Representatives held their first meeting of the new
school year on September 10 and thereafter met twice monthly with the
director.  On September 24 the Institute held a reception for
Representatives and Contacts, so that they might become better acquainted
with one another and discuss plans for 1996-1997.  The meeting set the
stage for another productive year of their work together.  In the
intervals between their meetings the Representatives communicate by phone
and through school visits with the Contacts for whom they serve as liaison
to the Representatives  committee.  In these ways, their meetings compile
information from, and distribute information to,  teachers throughout all
New Haven elementary, middle, and high schools.
