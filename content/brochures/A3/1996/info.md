The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is an educational partnership
between Yale University and the New Haven Public Schools designed to
strengthen teaching and learning in local schools and, by example, in
schools across the country. Through the Institute, Yale faculty members
and school teachers work together in a collegial relationship. The
Institute is also an interschool and interdisciplinary forum for teachers
to collaborate on new curricula. Each participating teacher becomes an
Institute Fellow and prepares a curriculum unit to be taught the following
year. Teachers have primary responsibility for identifying the subjects
the Institute addresses.
