<center><h2>Foreword</h2></center>
<hr/>
The present report covers the offerings, organization, and operation of the
Institute's 1996 program for the New Haven teachers who participated as
Fellows.  It draws extensively from the evaluations written by Fellows
and seminar leaders at the conclusion of their participation.  The report
also summarizes the Institute's recent activity in program development
and national dissemination, and its current fund-raising goal.  The year
was a productive time for the Institute's work locally and nationally. <p>
Specifically, the report documents the increasing teacher interest in
Institute seminars, the content of the seminars the Institute offered in
the humanities and the sciences, the application and admissions process,
and participants' experience in the program.  With respect to long-range
planning and program development, it describes the progress made in
opening Institute Centers for Professional and Curricular Development in
the schools, conducting a summer Academy for New Haven students,
correlating Institute-developed curriculum units with new school-district
academic standards, producing a videotape program on the structure and
process of the Institute, placing Institute resources on-line, and providing
computer assistance to the Fellows.  </p><p>
It summarizes the Institute's work also in national dissemination, in
particular the publication of the periodical, <i>On Common Ground</i>, which was
assisted by the Editorial Board.  Finally, it describes the status of the
Institute's initiative for securing financial support, in particular the need
that remains for building a more adequate endowment for the Institute.
