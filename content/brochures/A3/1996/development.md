The ongoing development of the Institute is guided by teachers from the
Schools and the University, and by the National Advisory Committee.  In
August 1995 the Institute reconstituted the teacher Steering Committee, a
group of school teachers who have played leading roles in the Institute at
various times since its inception.  The Steering Committee was convened
first in 1993 to plan the further development of the Institute s work in
New Haven and to explore in specific terms the relationship between
Institute resources and the priorities established by the new Public
Schools administration.  The Steering Committee meets biweekly during
eleven months of the year.  Each member of the Committee assumes
responsibility for working outside these meetings on one or more of the
following areas:  a new videotape program depicting the process and
structure of the Institute s annual program; the relationship of
Institute-developed curriculum units to systemwide curricula; Institute
Centers for Professional and Curricular Development; Fellows' use of the
Institute's on-line resources and electronic communicaions; and Academies
for Fellows and other teachers to teach Institute-developed curricular
material to New Haven students in after-school, Saturday, and summer
programs.
<p>
In addition, in the fall the Institute convened an Ad Hoc Group consisting
of the four Steering Committee members who have been part of that process
continuously since its inception.  This group was asked to take stock of
the long-range plans that have been made and the new activities that have
been undertaken as a result of the work of the Steering Committee since it
was formed.  The Group met every Monday after school to examine the
several new ways of working the Steering Committee devised for the
Institute, to consider which of these should be continued, and to
construct the best organizational structure to ensure strong teacher
leadership throughout this work in the future.  By December the Group had
decided on the next steps the Institute should take in four areas:
</p><blockquote>
1.	The annotated reference list and chart of
Institute resources and New Haven curriculum standards for teaching about
diversity and community, developed in July by the Institute Curriculum
Committee
<p>
2.	The 1996 Academy where Fellows taught
Institute-developed curricula to New Haven students
</p><p>
3.	The already existing and newly developing
Institute Centers for Curriculum and Professional Development
</p><p>
4.	The Institute s partnership with Dwight Hall that
provides coordinated Yale student services in schools with Institute
Centers

<h3>University Advisory Council</h3>
Yale faculty members advise and assist the
Institute through the University Advisory Council and its Executive
Committee, both appointed by the Yale President.  The University Advisory
Council meets once each year, the Executive Committee twice each semester,
and the Council co-chairs meet and communicate frequently with the
director between meetings.  Members of the Executive Committee and the
Steering Committee meet jointly from time to time to share information
about their respective activity and to explore appropriate ways of working
together. 
<p>
During 1996 the Executive Committee met in March, April,
October, November and December.  These meetings concerned priorities and
plans for the Institute s work locally and nationally, in particular, the
Institute Centers in New Haven schools, and various possibilities for
working with other institutions nterested in adapting the Institute s
approach to their local conditions.  Members of the Steering Committee
participated in the April meeting, and in December the Executive Committee
held its meeting in the Institute Center at Career High School.  The
Executive Committee recommended to President Richard C. Levin the
appointment of several Yale faculty members as new members of the
University Advisory Council, each of whom accepted the President's
appointment: Margaret A. Farley, Stark Professor of Christian Ethics; A.
Patrick McCaughey, Director of the Center for British Art; and David
Pease, Dean of the School of Art.  The Executive Committee, acting as the
Institute's course of study committee, also approved the Institute's 1996
offerings so that the Institute might certify Fellows'  course of study to
institutions where they may be pursuing advanced degrees.

</i></font></td></tr><tr><td>
On April 11, the full University Advisory Council held its
third annual meeting with President  Levin. Co-chair Jules D. Prown opened
the meeting by describing the work of the Executive Committee of the
Council, as it has met during the year since the Council's last meeting.
Frederick J. Streets described the new partnership between the Teachers
Institute and Dwight Hall through which Yale undergraduates are paid to
serve as interns in four New Haven schools.  The students are responsible
for coordinating the provision of Yale volunteers in schools that are
developing Institute Centers for Professional and Curricular Development.
Thomas R. Whitaker spoke about the first Institute video, "Teaching on
Common Ground," that was intended to acquaint people in New Haven and
across the country with the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, which the
Council saw at its 1995 meeting.  He also described plans for a second
video, being supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York, for which
he has been engaged to write the script.  The new video will be designed
to supplement the first, but it will be coherent and complete enough to
stand alone.  It will address teachers and administrators in both schools
and universities, in New Haven and in other cities, as well as members of
foundations and other funding organizations, and, more generally, all
those who are interested in the future of public education in the United
States.  Whitaker also described the progress made in publishing the
periodical <i>On Common Ground.	</i>

President Levin then welcomed new members of the Council.  He said
that he appreciates the ways in which Council members assist the Institute
and that he wished to underscore how central and important the Institute
is to Yale and to its interaction with New Haven.  He said that the
Institute is an early model of university-school partnership that takes
what we know and do best at Yale and applies that knowledge effectively in
assisting local schools.  This is an activity for which Yale has a
demonstrated capacity, and he encouraged Council members to consider
participating also by leading an Institute seminar.  He said that these
seminars are a "two-way street,"  and that he knows that University
faculty
members also benefit themselves from the experience of leading the
seminars.

Levin then spoke of the event held in December 1995 when
the Institute celebrated the completion of two challenge grants for the
endowment of its operation in the humanities.  The President said that it
was a pleasure to remind the Council that those challenges, which had been
awarded several years earlier by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund
and the National Endowment for the Humanities, had been successfully
completed.  He said that James R. Vivian and colleagues in the Institute
had raised a portion of the matching funds the challenges required.  "To
demonstrate the commitment of the Officers to the Institute," he said, he
himself had  "topped off" the match by encouraging several key donors to
designate their generous gifts to the University for this precise purpose.

Vivian then reported on recent developments of the
Institute's work in New Haven and possible plans for assisting other
cities to develop Teachers Institutes through national seminars and
colloquia, consulting relationships with other institutions, and new
publications.  The Council commented on, and raised questions about, these
plans.

<h3> National Advisory Committee
</h3>	
A National Advisory Committee, composed of Americans
distinguished in the fields of education, private philanthropy, and public
policy, assists the Teachers Institute with the further dissemination,
evaluation, and development of its program.  New members are invited to
serve, from time to time, by the Yale President.  In advance of National
Advisory Committee meetings, members of the University Advisory Council
and the Steering Committee meet separately and together to discuss program
development and evaluation, national dissemination, and finance.  On each
of these and any other timely topics, they prepare papers that are
circulated to brief the Committee before the meetings.
<p>
As the Teachers Institute plays a leading role in the
national movement for university-school collaboration, the National
Advisory Committee assists in determining how to make the most effective
contribution to institutions and schools in other communities.  With
respect to evaluation, the Committee provides a variety of perspectives
that aid in examining what each constituency for such collaborative
programs would regard as the best evidence of their effectiveness.  Before
the National Advisory Committee met in New Haven on May 8 for a full day
of focused discussion, they received a detailed briefing paper providing
them background on the Institute s work since their last meeting.
</p><p>
Vivian opened the meeting with remarks about two of the
original members of the Committee who died since the Committee last met.
Because of their early prominence in advocating partnerships between
universities and schools in order to strengthen teaching and learning,
Fred M. Hechinger and Ernest L. Boyer were invited by President A.
Bartlett Giamatti in 1984 to become members of the Committee.  From that
time until their deaths in late 1995 they assisted and brought attention
to the Institute in numerous ways.  Morning sessions then focused on the
continuing development of the Institute program in New Haven and the
ongoing plans for the further dissemination of the Institute approach
across the country.  A panel of New Haven participants made brief
presentations on, and answered questions about, teams of the Fellows and
the seminars, the new Institute Centers, and the summer Academy.
Superintendent of New Haven Public Schools Reginald R. Mayo and Associate
Superintendent Verdell Roberts also took part.  Discussion turned in
particular to the involvement of the Institute and its Fellows in the
school s systems initiatives in curriculum and staff development, and ways
in which that role might be more amply documented.

After viewing the Institute video, "Teaching On Common Ground,"  the
Committee then focused on the existing and potential means for
dissemination of the Institute's work, including publication of the
periodical <i>On Common Ground.  </i>A luncheon afforded the opportunity
for more informal exchange among members of the Committee and Institute
participants from New Haven.
<p>
President Levin joined the Committee for the afternoon
session, which Gordon M. Ambach, Executive Director of the Council of
Chief State School Officers, opened by summarizing the results of the
Committee's meeting thus far.  The Committee noted how much progress had
been made in developing the Institute s programs in New Haven since the
Committee s last meeting.  Much of the discussion then concerned what
should be the appropriate balance between deepening the Institute's
efforts in New Haven and extending its reach to other cities.

<h3>Computer Resources and Assistance</h3>
From the Institute's inception, Fellows have been full
members of the Yale community with access to resources throughout the
University, including borrowing privileges at the libraries.  For several
years the Institute has been exploring how computing can provide an
effective instrument for enhancing its partnership because of the ways in
which computing overcomes the barriers of time and distance that can
impede collaboration, and because it is a non-hierarchical form of
communication and therefore quite consistent with the collegiality that is
a tenet of the Institute's approach.  In 1995 Fellows first became
eligible for Yale computer accounts; in 1996 a number of Fellows gained
Internet access in this way.  In addition, as described above,
the Institute engages undergraduate and graduate students who serve as
computer assistants to the Fellows, a role that is modeled to some extent
on that of the computer assistants in the undergraduate residential
colleges.
<p>
During 1996 the Institute made substantial progress in
creating an electronic version of its curricular and other material and in
promoting and facilitating electronic communication between schools and
the University. (Its Internet address, where the resources may be viewed,
is <a href="..\..\">http://teachersinstitute.yale.edu</a>.)  As the Institute
increases resources
on-line, these become available nationally to a much greater extent than
was possible when its dissemination depended heavily on printed material.
To call attention to this growing resource, the Institute s Web location
was advertised prominently on the cover of <i>On Common Ground.  </i>
</p></td><td><hr/><i>The Institute has been exploring how computing can provide an

</i></td></tr><tr><td>
In July, Institute computer assistants demonstrated the
Institute's electronic resources to groups of New Haven teachers and
administrators.  One such session was conducted in the electronic
classroom of Yale's Cross Campus Library and featured the unveiling of the
on-line version of the New Haven Public Schools' new Curriculum Framework
document.  Diane Garber, Director of Curriculum for New Haven Public
Schools, and William J. Derry, Coordinator of Library and Media, were both
in attendance.
<p>
By the end of 1996, the Institute s electronic resources
included all Numbers of <i>On Common Ground,</i>guides to all the
curriculum units written since 1978 which may be searched using key words,
the topical Index to these units, and approximately 200 of the individual
curriculum units in their entirety.  In 1996 the Institute urged Fellows
to submit their units on a diskette, as well as in printed form, and three
quarters of Fellows did so.  This accelerates the process of placing the
units on-line in that they do not have to be scanned and proofread first.
The curriculum units now on-line include all the units that have ever been
submitted on disk, together with a number that have been scanned and
processed through optical character recognition software.

During the summer, the Institute engaged a vendor to scan
all the remaining curriculum units.  This material then will be converted
into the proper electronic format and placed on-line. The Institute also
undertook to upgrade its Web space so as to increase the ease with which
teachers may search electronically for curriculum units that may prove
useful in their teaching.  At the same time, Web sites were constructed
for the Institute Center schools, all of which now have within their
Center a computer that connects to the Internet and provides ready access
to the Institute s electronic resources.

<h3>Teams of Fellows
</h3>
During the past three years especially, the Institute has
explored various new ways for working with inividual schools.  For
example, a team of four teachers from Beecher Elementary School
participated in the 1994 seminar in "Poetry" led by Paul H. Fry.  The
Fellows team developed related curriculum units that, using poetry as a
focus, were designed for students to gain a broader understanding of their
particular cultural group.  For a culminating activity students presented
a school-wide assembly in 1995 featuring poetry, drama, music, and dance
pertaining to their units of study. 
</td></tr><tr><td><i> (picture available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><i>Paul H. Fry and Jean E. Sutherland describing the
work of the 1994 Beecher Fellows' team at the National Advisory Committee
meeting.
</i></font></td></tr><tr><td>
The Beecher team's experience demonstrated how, by working
together, Fellows can magnify the results of their Institute participation
for their school.  In 1996 the Institute therefore encouraged teams of
teachers from any school to apply to take part together in an Institute
seminar.  In this way, they might develop complementary curriculum units
that envision teaching a seminar topic in an interdisciplinary and
inter-grade fashion.  Each team also would plan a culminating activity for
its work in the school during the year following seminar participation.
In 1996 Fellows teams from Beecher, as well as from Career High School and
Polly T. McCabe Educational Center, participated in the seminars on film,
astronomy, and environmental and occupational health, respectively.  It
was, in fact the strong interest of Career High School teachers in an
interdisciplinary offering related to health that led to that seminar,
into which teachers from other schools were also accepted.  The teams
prepared interrelated curriculum units for using film to teach about
negative stereotypes, astronomy to teach science and math, and several
disciplines to teach about the environmental consequences of war.  In
their evaluations, the Fellows who were team members spoke of the
advantages they saw in this form of participation:
<blockquote>
Two years ago, I participated in a team effort through the Institute which
proved to be highly successful, both in the classroom and for the entire
student body of our school.  Again, I feel that our team has great
potential for offering curriculums that will benefit a large portion of
our school s student population in individual classrooms and through
collaborative teaching.  I am very excited about getting together as a
team this fall and beginning our team effort for the coming school year
with a final gala in the spring of 1997.</blockquote>
</td><td><hr/><i> By working together as a team, Fellows can magnify the results
of
their Institute participation for their school.<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>
<blockquote>
I feel the unit I have written this year is a strong one and a valuable
one for my third grade pupils.  As part of a school team, I feel my
material will help students on other grade levels.  I also feel that the
units written by other team members will feed into the growth of my
classroom.  I also hope that the work of our team will positively affect
and involve other members of our staff and will draw parents into the
curriculum material we have developed.
<p>
When a team is involved, there is a better chance for that team to exert
influence on the school curricula.  In fact, change starts in the
classroom when a Fellow is writing a unit.  If there is more than one
Fellow working on one particular unit, more students are going to be
touched by this material and by the communication between the teachers.
This is what is happening in our school.  As we gain more experience
things get more clear and defined.  We are also more prepared to take
risks.
</p><p>
In my school as a whole, past Institute activities, which other staff
members and I have participated in and promoted, have helped to attract
seven of sixteen classroom teachers as Fellows this year.  We now have a
team  of five teachers who will present their units in an integrated
effort and, once space is available, we will officially apply as a "Center
school."   In many ways, we are already fuctioning in this capacity.

<h3>Institute Centers for Professional and Curricular Development
</h3>
With the New Haven Public Schools, the Institute in 1996 undertook
a new program designed to broaden and deepen its long-standing efforts to
strengthen teaching and learning in the schools.  The Institute offered
several elementary, middle, and high schools the opportunity to establish
an Institute Center for Professional and Curricular Development within
their buildings.  At a Board of Education meeting on May 28, the Institute
and the Schools formally announced the establishment of five Centers.  The
New Haven Public Schools Director of Curriculum introduced the topic to
the Board, and the leading teacher in each school Center briefly described
the Academic Plan for their Center to the Board.  According to Verdell
Roberts, Associate Superintendent of Schools,  "The interaction among
teaching professionals in the Centers will promote collegiality, staff
development, self growth, and creativity in the classroom.  This is a
terrific way to assure that Institute resources will directly benefit many
more of our students."   Each Center houses a complete set of the
Institute
s printed volumes and reference materials.  In addition, the Centers will
provide computer links to the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute s
extensive curricular resources on-line.  The established Centers include
the two elementary, two middle, and one high school.  Each Center
developed an Academic Plan that outlines how Institute resources can
assist teachers to improve student learning while addressing school and
district goals.  Assuming the success of the pilot phase, this opportunity
will be extended in coming years to all schools in the New Haven system.

Teachers at Career High School intend to use their
Institute Center to act on the  thematic interdisciplinary approach  to
teaching and the "collaborative, problem-based learning activities" called
for in their school s magnet implementation plan.  The Institute Center at
Roberto Clemente Middle School will provide impetus to team teaching and
the development of thematic units.  Teamwork and technology combine at
Mauro s Institute Center where teachers develop lesson plans of an
interdisciplinar--and--multicultural nature.  Teachers also work on
personal assessment portfolios, evaluating their own teaching methods and
status as a learner.  At the Hill Central Middle School Institute Center
several teachers participating in the 1996 Institute seminar on Astronomy
used the Center to develop closely related curriculum units.  Grade-level
meetings were also held in the Center, encouraging team teaching.
Teachers at Jackie Robinson Middle School intend to use their Institute
Center as a place where both individuals and teams can gather to develop
classroom curricula and plan school initiatives.

As with other Institute programs, then, the Centers emphasize teachers'
on-going collaborative development of their curricula.  In effect, the
Centers are an effort to create in schools a place that will be conducive
to the kinds of conversationsteachers have with each other and with their
Yale colleagues in Institute seminars on campus.  Whereas the Fellows
program takes place at the University, Institute Centers operate from
attractive and properly equipped rooms within the schools themselves.
They contain special furnishings designed by Yale faculty member Kent
Bloomer, who previously has led two Institute seminars. The Centers are
intended to:
<ul>		
<li>					Increase the visibility and use of
Institute resources within the schools
</li><li>Include teachers who have not before
been Institute Fellows
</li><li>Disseminate Institute-developed
curriculum units more widely
</li><li>Explore the potential of computing as a means
of collaboration
</li><li>Apply the Institute s principles in new ways
within the school environment itself.
</li></ul>
</td></tr><tr><td><i>(picture available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><i>Kent C. Bloomer presenting the prototype of his

As their name indicates, Institute Centers are designed to
encourage and to assist with curricular and staff development that draws
primarily on Institute resources.  This purpose is in keeping with each of
the "Kids First"  school district goals.  These goals call for more
site-based management, improvement of curriculum and instruction, greater
staff development, increased parental involvement, and improved physical
conditions of schools.  The Centers directly address the first three of
these goals and provide new opportunities with respect to the last two.

<h3>Involvement of Yale Students
</h3>
A point stressed in the first University Advisory Council meeting,
held in April 1994, and a strong interest of teachers in our leadership,
has been to identify additional ways to involve Yale students in the
Institute.  As mentioned above, the Institute has begun to involve
undergraduate and graduate students as computer asistants to the Fellows.
In addition, the Institute has been developing a partnership with Dwight
Hall, the organization that provides an umbrella for all student volunteer
groups on campus.  After undertaking a several-months study, two student
members of the Dwight Hall Executive Committee drafted a statement on the
advantages they believe such a partnership will have for both our
organizations.  This proposal was presented formally to the Dwight Hall
Cabinet and to the Institute Steering Committee and endorsed by both
groups early in 1996.  
<p>		
As a result, Dwight Hall has engaged student interns to
coordinate existing student volunteer activities in three of the schools
that are establishing Institute Centers, and to assist those schools with
the implementation of their Center Academic Plan.  To coordinate volunteer
student services for all the schools, and to assist each Center in
formulating and implementing its plans, the Institute for its part has
engaged a Yale graduate student as Liaison to the Centers.  He works
directly with the education "pod leader"  at Dwight Hall, who is in effect
the coordinator of all Yale volunteer services in the schools.  
</p><p>
The student coordinators focus the time and energy of Yale students in
areas that school teachers themselves identify as those where their
assistance can be particularly helpful.  In this way, the Institute-Dwight
Hall partnership can create greater leverage for accomplishing each school
s own academic plans to strengthen teaching and learning. It also provides
a valuable experience for the Yale students who are involved. As one
intern wrote:
</p><blockquote>		
Working at a high school within the boundaries of New Haven has helped me
not only to learn more about the city, but to feel better about my own
personal experience at Yale...I came to Yale wanting to work in the city
and
this has allowed me to do that through the schools, which is the main
target that I originally wanted.

<h3>School District Curriculum Standards and Priorities
</h3>
The teachers who taught in the summer Academy in August
also constituted an Institute curriculum committee that was charged with
responsibility for devising ways to relate the Institute's curricular
resources to the new curriculum standards that were being drafted by the
New Haven Public Schools'  administration.  To plan this new activity, a
number of meetings were held with the Associate Superintendent of Schools
and the Director of Curriculum.  Because extensive Institute resources
have been developed for teaching about diversity and community--and
because
teaching about diversity is a prominent aspect of curriculum standards
being developed for most school subjects--we decided to focus on this
topic
as a particularly promising one for demonstrating the relationship between
Institute resources and school curricula.

The nine teachers involved in the summer Academy met for
two weeks in July and produced two draft documents: a chart that
correlates all Institute curriculum resources for teaching about diversity
with all the New Haven curriculum standards that call for teaching about
diversity; and an annotated reference list of the more than 300 curriculum
units the committee identified as significantly related to this topic.
However these documents may later be used by other educators, this work
had particular value for the committee members themselves.  As two wrote:
<blockquote>
After having worked on the curriculum and standards correlation, I
am more aware of the resources available that I can use in my classes.  I
also now can recommend more units to other teachers.<p>
I benefited greatly from taking part in the process.  I am now very aware
of the material contained in manyof the units.  While working, I also
noted units I felt would be valuable for use in my classroom.
</p></blockquote>
As mentioned above, the Ad Hoc Group planned what the next steps should be
for determining the value and usefulness of these documents.
<p>
In short, the curriculum work in July provided a useful pilot
activity for developing, on a broad range of topics, the relationship
between curriculum standards and Institute resources.  The Institute also
worked with the school district to place its curriculum standards on the
Institute's Web page, thus expediting an electronic version of this
material for various other uses throughout the school system.

<h3>Academy</h3>
In 1994 a first Academy in Multicultural Studies and Environmental
Science offered a new summer program to students in grades 3-8.  Through
the Academy, teams of teachers who had participated in the Teachers
Institute taught their own and other teacher'  Institute curriculum units
to selected New Haven students.  This demonstrated the vitality of the
teaching and learning the units entail, showed their adaptability to
different grade levels and classrooms than their authors may have
originally envisioned, and further indicated the desirability and
potential for their wider dissemination throughout the school system.
This team approach fostered an effective "mentoring" relationship between
teachers who designed the curriculum units and those who were using them
for the first time.
<p>		
The success of the pilot summer Academy also demonstrated
the potential of this activity for combining individual curriculum units
into larger works of curriculum to be introduced as courses or school
themes, and as system-wide curricula.  In short, the Academy provided a
fruitful opportunity for the Institute and the Schools administration to
begin to consider concrete plans that led to the establishment of the new
Institute Centers for Professional and Curricular Development.

The Institute therefore planned a second Academy that was
conducted in August 1996 by nine teachers (who were Institute Fellows at
the same time) for 77 New Haven elementary, middle, and high school
students.  The Academy was based on the successful experience with the
pilot effort in 1994 and, like the earlier Academy,  focused on two
themes: diversity and community, and environmental studies.  Academy
activities were located at two of the schools that have established
Centers for Professional and Curricular Development, and this will
facilitate follow through with students from the summer program.  The nine
teachers who aught in the Academy completed written evaluations of their
own and their students  experience.  These were transcribed and circulated
in advance of four after-school meetings they held together--and with the
Ad Hoc Group--in October and November.

In their evaluations, the Fellows teaching in the Academy
described the particular value of the Institute units they used.  Four
wrote: 
<blockquote>		
These units helped the ethnic students to write with precision about
themselves, articulate and describe their ethnic background as well as
examine others that make up the diverse population of the United States.
<p>
All the units used this summer were extremely beneficial in allowing us to
teach students how to write positively about themselves and their
experiences.
</p><p>
The Institute units chosen were extremely adaptable.  Although most units
were written to last for longer periods of time than we had, the units
themselves worked as guides for our plans and daily lessons with each of
the children.
</p><p>
The materials were high-interest materials, motivational for teachers and
students and flexible.  The curricular focus was on multicultural studies
and environmental science using an integrated approach.  Teachers focused
on basic skills such as writing, reading, math and problem solving.
Diversity and multicultural education were strands throughout the
curriculum.</p></blockquote>

The teachers spoke as well of the value, for themselves,
of teaching in the summer Academy.  Three wrote:
Working for this summer Academy allowed me to try out
several ideas that I plan to use with my classes this year.  It also gave
me an opportunity to work with students that will hopefully be a part of
the YNHTI's Center at Jackie Robinson.  
<p>
I found it to be a valuable opportunity to collaborate with another
teacher and to shape a curriculum that utilizes the strengths and
particular areas of interest of the instructors.  I feel that [we] were
able to learn from each other.  This is important to personal and
professional growth.

They spoke as well of the manner of teaching they were
able to employ in the Academy.  Two wrote:
<blockquote>
I felt I was more relaxed...perhaps more energetic due to
the high motivation level of the students.  There was plenty of time,
scheduling was more flexible, and the team approach kept things moving.
Both students and teachers were very eager.  I felt confident and excited
about what we were doing.  The emphasis was on fun, getting to know one
another better, and helping each other to learn cooperatively in a small
classroom setting.
<p>
My teaching style, which is generally very familiar (while still
rigorous), worked well in this type of setting.  Also, I thoroughly
enjoyed the opportunity to team teach; it kept the teachers fresh and the
students engaged.

The Fellows teaching in the Academy thought there were particular
advantages for the students that came from involving them actively in
classroom learning.  Institute Fellows often report that the excitement
they experience for a seminar subject carries over into and helps energize
their own classrooms during the school year.  In a similar way, the
Fellows teaching in the Academy spoke of the stimulating environment they
created for their students.  Three wrote:
<blockquote>
Were the students engaged more actively?  Absolutely.  The format planned
to involve students as "active learners."   No one was exempt from this
process.  We  warmed up  each day with brain teasers, puzzles, or games.
We mixed fun and facts to te extent that students seemed to enjoy the
activities we had planned.  We worked at variety, dividing the time up
into smaller segments of time.  Each week was goaloriented, with a
culminating activity each Friday that helped engage students and move them
forward.  We did a lot of videotaping, which was another valuable
incentive to "perform" at a high level.<p>
The Academy was designed to facilitate interdisciplinary learning using
handson learning.  A strange thing occurred, the student assistants
commented that the students were working all the time and did not have
time for fun.  The younger students were having fun, because they thought
they were playing.  After a few days some of the assistants came over to
me and said,  "I understand what you mean, this thing is contagious." 
</p><p>
For many of the students that  learning was more engaging and active than
learning they were accustomed to in their regular classroom settings.

In conclusion, Academy teachers spoke of the value of the experience for
both themselves and their students.  Three wrote:
<blockquote>
Inform the Superintendent that the program was very worthwhile and should
be expanded.  Teachers can have summer teaching experiences that are
rejuvenating, and this program is certainly going in the right direction,
using teacherdeveloped curriculum.  Teachers are given freedom within
certain parameters to teach creatively, without sacrificing discipline and
structure.  Remember that students were given no credit or monetary
rewards to entice them, only an enriching educational experience!

My overall experience at the YaleNew Haven Teachers Academy greatly
exceeded my expectations.  The project appealed to me first because it was
an opportunity to teamteach with respected colleagues, from whom I
acquired a great deal of practical insight into the areas of organization,
planning and ways of successfully interacting with students.  Being able
to interact in a classroom with another teacher is an energizing
experience; consequently I plan to invite more teachers and guest speakers
into my classroom for more teamteaching experience.  Another appeal of the
program was the opportunity to utilize and modify lessons from my own
Institute units, and to get feedback and suggestions from a colleague and
from students.  The students proved very responsive to our efforts to
combine facts, fun, creativity and structure.  From my point of view, the
program was energizing.  I viewed myself as a participant with students
who were giving up valuable summer time to learn valuable things.  What
could I teach them of value?  I forced myself to look at the two weeks
from a high school student s perspective; by doing so it made planning
much more exciting and fun.  What did the experience mean to me?  The 1996
summer Academy experience forced me as an educator to rededicate myself to
create learning situations for my students that will get them excited
about the study of history as it relates to their everyday experience.  I
owe the Academy a debt of gratitude for giving me the opportunity to
reexperience some of what I call my  first love  teaching students who
challenged me to give of myself to the utmost  a process which resulted in
close personal relationships and mutual respect which I shall cherish for
a long time.
<p>
The summer Academy was very rewarding for me.  I left feeling that my
colleagues, particularly at the high school level, are doing an
outstanding job with young people.  I would love to have the opportunity
to work with such a dynamic group of young people on a year round basis.
