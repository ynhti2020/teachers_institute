The DeWitt Wallace-Reader s Digest Fund and the National Endowment for the
Humanities have provided the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute major
grants in the form of both endowment and program support.  The Pew
Charitable Trusts have provided significant operating support for
1995-1997.  The 1996 Institute program was also supported in part by
grants from the Xerox Foundation, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the
Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, and the Sherman Fairchild Foundation.  In
addition, a number of individuals and foundations, notably the William
Randolph Hearst Foundation and the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, have
made gifts and grants toward the Endowment Fund for the Teachers
Institute.
