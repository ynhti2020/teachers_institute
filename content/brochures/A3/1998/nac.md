<td width="85%">A National Advisory Committee, composed of Americans distinguished
in the fields of education, private philanthropy, and public policy, assists
the Teachers Institute with the dissemination, evaluation, and development
of both the program in New Haven and the National Demonstration Project.
New members are invited to serve, from time to time, by the President of
Yale University. In 1998 two people accepted membership on the Committee:
Owen M. López, Executive Director, McCune Charitable Foundation;
and Ilene Mack, Senior Program Officer, William Randolph Hearst Foundation.
In advance of National Advisory Committee meetings, members of the University
Advisory Council and the Steering Committee meet separately and together
to discuss program development and evaluation, national dissemination,
and finance. On each of these and any other timely topics they prepare
papers that are circulated to brief the Committee before the meetings. 
<p>As the Teachers Institute plays a leading role in the national movement
for university-school partnerships the National Advisory Committee assists
in determining how to make the most effective contribution to institutions
and schools in other communities. The Committee provides a variety of perspectives
that aid in examining what each constituency for such partnerships would
regard as the best evidence of their effectiveness.

</p><p>The Committee met on March 6, 1998. The agenda for the day was designed
to seek the Committee’s advice in two areas: 
</p><blockquote>1. The Institute’s new ways of working in New Haven schools:
specifically, teams of Fellows from individual schools, electronic resources
and assistance, Centers for Professional and Curricular development in
certain schools, and summer Academies. 
<p>2. The national project that had been designed to demonstrate that the
approach the Institute has taken for twenty years in New Haven can be adapted
to establish similar university-school partnerships under different circumstances
in other cities. </p></blockquote>
Jules D. Prown, Co-Chairman of the University Advisory Council, welcomed
those in attendance. James R. Vivian, Director of the Institute introduced
the members who had joined the Committee since its last meeting on May
6, 1996: I. Michael Heyman, Secretary, The Smithsonian Institution; Bonnie
B. Himmelman, President, Sherman Fairchild Foundation, Inc., and David
L. Warren, President, National Association of Independent Colleges and
Universities. He then gave an overview of the meeting and the Director’s
Report, which summarized developments during 1997 in the local program
and in the planning for a National Demonstration Project.

</p><p>A variety of New Haven participants then spoke on the local program.
They included Reginald Mayo, Superintendent of the New Haven Public Schools;
Frederick J. Streets, University Chaplain (on his 1997 seminar); Sandra
Ferdman Comas, Assistant Professor of Spanish and Portuguese (on her 1997
seminar); Jean Sutherland, Third-grade Teacher, L. W. Beecher Elementary
School (on teams of Fellows in seminars); Edward Baker, Institute Center
Liaison (on electronic resources); Annette Streets, Institute Center Liaison
(on Academy); Alan Frishman, Magnet Resource Teacher, Career High School
(on its Institute Center and the mini-grant for training in diversity);
Sequella Coleman (on the new Institute Center at Fair Haven Middle School);
and Patricia Lydon, Liaison (on documentation of Center activity in 1997).
During the discussion that followed, members of the Committee urged especially
that the Institute further document its efforts, collecting data on how
the web site is used, providing a case study of a seminar, and describing
how the curriculum units relate to the district standards. A number of
the Committee members expressed appreciation at having these full reports
on the Institute’s recent developments.

</p><p>Thomas R. Whitaker then offered an overview of the national dissemination
in which the Institute had been engaged, including the periodical, <i>On
Common Ground</i>, the preparation of a second videotape program, “Excellence
in Teaching,” and the planning for the National Demonstration Project.
Brief comments on the planning process and site visits during 1997 were
then offered by several members of the Planning Team: Sabatino Sofia, Professor
and Chairman of Astronomy and Co-Chairman of the University Advisory Council;
Cynthia Russett, Professor of History; and Peter Herndon, History Teacher,
Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School. The discussion that followed
was in response to several questions posed by Director Vivian: How do we
ensure that the local program will not suffer during the National Demonstration
Project? What are the most important considerations in awarding grants?
What should we document? How should we disseminate the results? What should
we learn from in New Haven? Members of the Committee urged that the process
be risk-averse because it is already inherently risky, that it keep the
focus on the direct relations between university faculty members and teachers,
and that it might reach out to include yet other partners. 
</p><p>In an afternoon summary of the Committee’s morning discussion, Gordon
M. Ambach, Executive Director, Council of Chief State School Officers,
urged that the Institute “stay the course,” not diverting its attention
from the existing program, that it consider how Yale might help to build
the computer capacity of the schools, that it investigate the possibility
of corporate assistance in the area of technology, and that it provide
careful documentation of the curriculum units and the experience in using
them. With respect to the National Demonstration Project, he urged the
careful definition of criteria for selection of sites, a sharpening of
the purposes of the demonstration, and a determination of the impact that
should be achieved.

</p><p>A discussion with President Richard C. Levin focused on a number of
concerns: that the relation of demonstration sites to Schools of Education
should be carefully monitored, that school systems need stability in order
to benefit from a demonstration, that larger systems might well start with
a smaller cluster of schools, and that a presidential conversation among
a number of institutions might provide a litmus test for the viability
of demonstration sites.</p></td>
