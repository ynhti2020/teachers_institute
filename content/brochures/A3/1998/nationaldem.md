<p>The National Demonstration Project, supported by a four-year grant of
$2.5 million from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, aims to demonstrate
the feasibility of adaptations of the Institute’s approach at several other
sites. It directs its attention to sites where school systems serve a significant
number of students from low-income communities, but where the pattern and
magnitude of needs and resources are different from those that obtain in
New Haven, and where significant opportunities exist, without varying from
our approach, for devising local strategies in meeting those needs. From
March 1998 through January 1999, in accordance with its proposal to the
DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, the Teachers Institute accomplished
the following preparatory steps. 
</p><p>It invited fourteen sites to submit proposals for 8-month Planning Grants.
It provided to those sites initial information concerning the Institute’s
policies and procedures. It supervised the awarding of Planning Grants
on recommendation of a National Panel to five of the seven applicants:
a partnership among Chatham College, Carnegie Mellon University, and the
Pittsburgh Public Schools; a partnership between the University of Houston
and the Houston Independent School District; a partnership between the
University of New Mexico and the Albuquerque Public Schools; a partnership
between the University of California at Irvine and the Santa Ana Unified
School District; and a partnership between the University of California
at Santa Cruz and The Pjaro Valley Unified School District. The Teachers
Institute provided for the sites that received Planning Grants a “July
Intensive” that enabled a practical immersion in the processes of the Institute. 
</p><p>On recommendation of a National Panel and on the advice of the program
officer of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, and after further negotiations
with certain sites, the Teachers Institute awarded 3-year Implementation
Grants to four applicants: Chatham College, Carnegie Mellon University,
and the Pittsburgh Public Schools; the University of Houston and the Houston
Independent School District; the University of New Mexico and the Albuquerque
Public Schools; and the University of California at Irvine and the Santa
Ana Unified School District. The Teachers Institute then began, in part
through a January Orientation Session, to work with the Grantees on their
plans for the coming years. 
</p><p>The Grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund also enabled
the Institute to restructure its staff to include an Assistant Director
(Annette Streets), a Liaison to the Sites (Patricia Lydon), and an Advisor
and Writer (Thomas R. Whitaker). The Grant also enabled the Institute to
design and install a new computer system and database that will streamline
its operations and facilitate communication with the sites in the National
Demonstration Project. 
</p><p>The award to four applicants, instead of the three originally envisioned
in the proposal to the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, was made possible
in part by a supplementary grant of $150,000 by the McCune Charitable Foundation. 
</p><p>As will be described later in some detail, the four sites represent
quite different urban challenges. All have school systems considerably
larger than that of New Haven, and all must deal with serious problems
associated with low-income communities and a high proportion of racial
and ethnic diversity. But they also illustrate different institutional
configurations and different strategies in approaching those problems.

<td width="85%"><a name="b"></a><b>The Planning Phase</b>
<p>During 1997, as the Annual Report for that year has recounted, the Teachers
Institute had explored, with the support of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund, the feasibility and desirability of establishing such partnerships
at a number of sites. It had compiled a preliminary list of schools and
colleges from which it had received requests for assistance. It had surveyed
33 sites to determine their interest in adapting the Institute approach.
It had sent out to those sites both videos and printed materials to explain
the nature and process of the Institute. 
</p><p>To assist in this effort it created a Planning Team composed of James
R. Vivian, Director of the Institute; Carla Asher, Program Officer, DeWitt
Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund; faculty members from Yale University who
have led Institute seminars; teachers and an administrator from the New
Haven Public School system who have been Institute Fellows; and teachers,
faculty members, and administrators drawn from the Albuquerque, New Mexico
school system, the University of California at Irvine, and the University
of Michigan. [See Appendix for a complete listing of the Planning Team.]
The Planning Team held preliminary meetings to reach agreement on the fundamental
commitments necessary to any adaptation of the Institute approach to university-school
collaboration. It agreed to participate in informational site visits to
applicants as might be needed. And it determined the categories of sites
that might advantageously be included in a National Demonstration Project.
The Planning Team wished to explore the feasibility of adaptations at sites
falling within one or more of the following categories: a consortium of
institutions; a city and a university larger than New Haven and Yale; a
small college; a state university; a smaller university focused in the
sciences; and an institution that might show how a Teachers Institute emphasizing
the arts and sciences may exist in harmony with a school or department
emphasizing Education. 
</p><p>On the basis of responses to the survey, and previous and further contacts,
members of the Planning Team then made visits during the summer of 1997
to five sites in order to communicate the nature of this National Project,
to clarify and amplify the Institute’s understanding of the issues involved
in adapting the Institute’s model, and to begin to assess the desirability
and feasibility of participation by those sites. These sites were: the
University of Houston and the Houston Independent School District; the
University of California at Irvine and the Santa Ana Unified School District;
the University of New Mexico and the Albuquerque Public Schools; Washington
University and the St. Louis School District and several contiguous school
districts; and Johns Hopkins University and the Baltimore School District. 
</p><p><i>(picture available in print form)</i>
</p><p><i><font size="-1">Site visit meeting with teachers from Starlight Elementary
School, Rolling Hills Middle School, Aptos High School, Cabrillo College,
and Representatives of the University of California, Santa Cruz. </font></i>
</p><p>Those visits and other correspondence with additional sites led the
Planning Team to conclude that the time was right for the establishment
of several demonstration projects committed to the principles of collaboration
that the Institute had developed over the previous two decades. The Institute
therefore proposed in October, 1997, to the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest
Fund a four-year project that would constitute a major step toward the
nationwide establishment of such Teachers Institutes. The proposal envisaged
an invitation to fourteen sites, suggesting that they submit their own
proposals for five-and-a-half month Planning Grants for 1998. In addition
to the five sites already visited, this list included nine other variously
configured sites: the Commonwealth Federation (a consortium from which
we would invite application from no more than two institutions with a focus
on Pennsylvania cities); Harvard University; Indiana University, Pennsylvania;
Rutgers University, Newark; University of California at Santa Cruz (Monterey
Bay area); University of Michigan (perhaps Willow Run, Ypsilanti, and Detroit);
Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (rural Appalachia);
and Washington, DC (looking toward the participation of one or more institutions
including Catholic University, George Washington University, Georgetown
University, Howard University, and the Smithsonian Institution). 
</p><p>The proposal also envisaged that, on the basis of the Proposals for
Planning Grants, the National Panel would recommend to the Director of
the Institute five or six sites that seemed most deserving of subsequent
three-year support for this purpose. During the balance of 1998 the Institute
would then work closely with those sites. There would be a July Intensive
Session that would include “national seminars” and other meetings to make
evident in detail and “from the inside” the workings of the Institute’s
policies and procedures. The three sites that would then be awarded Implementation
Grants (by the same procedure as before) would work closely with the Institute
during the period from 1998 through 2001 as they prepared and launched
their own collaboratives, and their own annual seminars, adjusting the
Institute approach to their own resources and the needs of their specific
locations. There would be, for example, continuing directors’ meetings,
a national steering committee of teachers, a complementary advisory committee
of university faculty, another July Intensive Session in 1999, and three
conferences in October of 1999, 2000, and 2001 to share the ongoing challenges
and results. 
</p><p>Because the ground would be prepared for a self-sustaining organization
at each of the demonstration sites, one could expect that they would continue
the program activities after the completion of the grant period. Such a
national demonstration project would not only benefit the teachers and
students in those communities; it would also establish a potentially expandable
network of Teachers Institutes that should have a significant impact upon
education reform throughout this nation. 
</p><p>The entire process would be documented by persons working closely with
the Teachers Institute, by persons at the demonstration sites, and by an
external evaluation to be commissioned by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest
Fund. 
</p><p>The Planning Team helped to prepare a Request for Proposals that would
specify the criteria essential to the Institute approach, which must be
met by any proposed adaptation. Institute staff also developed the financial
requirements and expectations that would be part of the Request for Proposals.
The Institute then prepared to appoint an Implementation Team, drawn from
the larger Planning Team [for complete listing see Appendix], which would
make further site visits. It also prepared to appoint a National Panel,
which would recommend to the Director of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
those sites to which, in close consultation with the Program Officer of
the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, he should award Planning Grants
and Implementation Grants for the National Demonstration Project. 
</p><p>On March 16, 1998, the Institute received informal announcement of the
Implementation Grant by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. After
formal notification from the Fund on March 24, the Institute sent Requests
for Proposals for Planning Grants to the fourteen invited sites. By April
7, the deadline for indicating participation in a Voluntary Information
Session, it had received such indication from nine institutions. They included:
Chatham College, Franklin and Marshall College, Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
Rutgers University-Newark, The Catholic University of America, the University
of California, Irvine, the University of California, Santa Cruz, the University
of Michigan, and the University of New Mexico. On April 17, eight of those
sites (not including the University of California, Santa Cruz) came to
the Voluntary Information Session in New Haven. This session offered an
overview of the National Demonstration Project; a discussion of the basic
commitments it would require of any applicant for a Planning Grant; a preview
of activities (the July Intensive, site visits, individual assistance,
annual conferences, national committees, and documentation); and assistance
in preparing Proposals (the narrative, budget and budget narrative, cost
sharing, and applicable forms).

</p><p>By April 24, the deadline for declarations of intent to apply for a
Planning Grant, the Institute had received eight such declarations, with
outlines of the likely proposals and questions to be answered. The eight
sites were: the University of Houston and the Houston Independent School
District; the University of New Mexico and the Albuquerque Public School
District; the University of California at Irvine and the Santa Ana Unified
School District; the University of California at Santa Cruz and the P«jaro
Valley Unified School District; Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon University
and the Pittsburgh Public Schools; Indiana University of Pennsylvania and
the Pittsburgh Public Schools; Georgetown University with three public
schools and a private school; and Rutgers University at Newark and the
Newark Public Schools. Of those who chose not to apply, some, like Washington
University, said that they would pursue this direction independently and
might later affiliate with the Institute. 
</p><p>By May 15, the deadline for applications for Planning Grants, applications
had been received from all of those sites except Georgetown University,
and on May 18 those applications were circulated to the members of the
National Panel, which convened in New Haven on June 4. On June 5, on recommendation
by the National Panel and in consultation with the Program Officer of the
DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, Director Vivian awarded Planning Grants
to the University of Houston and the Houston Independent School District;
the University of New Mexico and the Albuquerque Public School District;
the University of California at Irvine and the Santa Ana Unified School
District; the University of California at Santa Cruz and the P«jaro
Valley Unified School District; and Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon
University and the Pittsburgh Public Schools.

</p><p>From July 6 through July 15, an “Intensive Session” was held for the
five sites that were awarded Planning Grants. This session included, as
specified in the proposal to the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, a
three-part program to meet the needs of school teachers, university faculty,
and planning directors. School teachers participated in one of three “National
Seminars,” which were condensed and truncated versions of seminars being
offered this year to the New Haven teachers. A rigorous schedule was designed
to afford ample opportunity for university faculty members and planning
directors to observe both the national and New Haven seminars, while at
the same time attending other meetings designed to assist them with their
own roles in the Teachers Institute they were planning. Overall, the schedule
was a mixture of participation in, and observation and discussion of, the
processes and procedures that characterize the Institute’s approach to
professional and curriculum development. There were also opportunities
for teachers, faculty members, and directors to caucus within their respective
groups to discuss the specific roles they will play with New Haven colleagues
who have experience in those roles. Time was reserved so that the team
from each site could meet to consider the relevance of its experience and
discussions in New Haven to the plans for their Teachers Institute. 
</p><p>Rogers Smith, Professor of Political Science, led a seminar on “American
Political Thought”; Sabatino Sofia, Professor of Astronomy, led one on
“Selected Topics in Contemporary Astronomy and Space Science”; and Thomas
Whitaker, Professor Emeritus of English, led one on “Reading Across the
Cultures.” The participants, one teacher from each site in each seminar,
followed a condensed version of the common reading covered in the local
seminar and prepared curriculum units in stages from Prospectus through
First Draft. Teachers from the sites were “admitted” to these seminars
by Coordinators from New Haven who then served as advisors for them prior
to the seminars. Each site also designated one of its three teachers as
a Coordinator in the seminar in which that teacher participated (two seminars
therefore actually had two Coordinators): they met with Director Vivian
and New Haven Coordinators on appropriate issues as the seminars proceeded.
Because the Institute was trying to incorporate as many experiences as
possible that characterize the New Haven program, talks were also offered
by the three seminar leaders to all those in attendance at the July Intensive. 
</p><p>The responses to the national seminars by the Fellows from the five
sites were in general enthusiastic. One wrote: 
</p><blockquote>Everyone in our seminar made the effort to complete the readings
because we enjoyed the seminar so much and wanted to participate fully.
Our seminar leader did a good job of balancing the dissemination of information
and sharing of his knowledge and insights with discussion. He seemed to
value responses, creating a non-threatening and inclusive atmosphere for
discussion. </blockquote>

</p><p>Another wrote: “Our seminar leader is a model teacher. He is brilliant,
kind, sensitive, and above all, human. I felt at ease in his seminar and
during appointments. Having worked with him has raised my opinion of the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.” 
</p><p>A third Fellow wrote: “Challenged by the task at hand we plunged headlong
into content, curricula, collaboration and conversation. Individually and
collectively, we sought to elevate and enhance the quality and relevance
of the education that we have committed ourselves to make available for
the students that we serve in diversely populated urban schools.” 
</p><p>This Fellow said of the seminar leader: 
</p><blockquote>He is a “gem.” The ease with which he led us, intellectually
and textually, with deep insight, expertise, and intuition while simultaneously
co-sharing in the experience as a “learner” was a model for excellent teaching
and professionalism. He does not reside in the “ivory tower”; rather, he
lives, “tuned in” to his students, respecting, validating, and challenging
the individual “gifts” that each contributed to the seminar. He generously
provided personal materials, resources, support, constructive criticism
and a gentle, thoughtful, scholarly presence. </blockquote>
Another Fellow said: “I thoroughly enjoyed the seminar leader’s charm,
sense of humor, and, above all, his ability to guide me through the writing
of the curriculum unit.” And yet another wrote about the curriculum unit: 
<blockquote>The production of the curriculum unit was an extremely worthwhile
aspect of the program for its teaching value, and for the focus in the
thought process that was involved in creating it. Because the emphasis
was on the writing of the strategies and rationale of the unit, I necessarily
had to analyze why I would teach the subject in a certain way and what
I hoped my students would achieve. This process has produced a clear, deliberate
teaching unit that will definitely benefit my students. An additional benefit
is the enthusiasm and energy that this creative process has generated.
It has renewed my desire to find better ways to approach other lessons
as well. </blockquote>

</p><p>At a plenary meeting late in the Intensive Session an issue arose concerning
the expectation that the National Fellows complete a first draft of the
curriculum unit. Some felt, especially given the tight schedule and some
difficulties concerning library access and computer facilities, that this
should not be expected. The issue was handled and resolved in a manner
that characterizes procedures within the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.
After full discussion, it was referred to a meeting of the Coordinators.
The Coordinators, after some further debate, decided to keep the expectation
of a first draft as established but to make clear in each seminar that
the Fellows might proceed as far toward fulfilling that expectation as
seemed reasonable to them, given the logistical difficulties. In fact,
all Fellows did proceed to complete first drafts. This experience authentically
demonstrated the principle of teacher leadership better than any way that
the Institute could have contrived. 
</p><p><i>(picture available in print form)</i>
</p><p><i><font size="-1">Plenary Session at the Intensive Session. </font></i>
</p><p>University faculty members observed the national seminars and also the
local seminars in session; and school teachers also had the opportunity
to observe local seminars. Sessions were held for university faculty members,
and they also attended meetings with Yale faculty members. Each visiting
faculty member prepared (in consultation with a Yale faculty member) a
proposal for a seminar in a Teachers Institute. One faculty member wrote:
“It was particularly inspiring to observe the faculty-teacher interaction
in the local seminars. I would even go so far as to say that without those
observations, I would be somewhat skeptical of the benefits of the program.”
This faculty member also said: 
</p><blockquote>It was exceedingly useful to see five different models (two
in the local, three in the national seminars) of ways to conduct the seminar,
leader expectations, participant involvement, etc. I was strongly impressed
by the knowledge and commitment of the seminar leaders and their patience
and ability to connect with the Fellows at a number of levels and to connect
the material of the seminars to the individual situations of the Fellows. </blockquote>

</p><p>In general, faculty members did feel that there was some artificiality
in the requirement that they develop a seminar proposal, and some of them
encountered difficulty in obtaining access to resources. Even the most
enthusiastic thought that their presence was not needed for the entire
ten days. In accord with these suggestions, the Institute is rethinking
the roles of faculty members in the July Intensive for 1999. 
</p><p>Sessions were also held for the planning directors, who met with Director
Vivian, Patricia Lydon, and Yale faculty members. The planning directors
prepared (in consultation with Director Vivian) planning statements that
outlined the process needed to establish a Teachers Institute at their
sites. Each member of the visiting team therefore had appropriate meetings,
opportunities to observe, and tasks of writing. Additional sessions allowed
the groups to meet together by site, by category of position, and as a
whole (sometimes with, sometimes without, the presence of people from New
Haven). 
</p><p>One planning director wrote: 
</p><blockquote>The July Intensive greatly added to my understanding of Institute
procedures. Talking with the New Haven teachers and attending the seminar
coordinators meetings that Jim Vivian held, helped to clarify the important
roles of school representatives and seminar coordinators. The simulation
of a discussion of approving seminar proposals was informative. </blockquote>
Another said: “The observation of local seminars was not only useful administratively
speaking but great fun intellectually. I believe that the experience will
help our team anticipate the likely preparation that Fellows will bring
to our Teachers Institute, as well as providing us with a model of the
roles that each of the parties plays in the success of the seminar.” This
director added: “I found the preparation of the planning statement to be
particularly valuable, since it forced me to develop a timeline of tasks
that needed to be undertaken.” 
<p>A third planning director said: 
</p><blockquote>Participation in the Intensive revealed how critical the role
of the director is in the planning and operation of the Institute. Throughout
the Intensive, Yale faculty and New Haven teachers attributed the success
and the longevity of the Institute in great measure to the skills and abilities
of the director and the high regard in which he is held by all participants
in the Institute. </blockquote>
This director added: 
<blockquote>I found the breadth of the schedule to be excellent. It included
sufficient samples of the activities that occur within the Institute so
that at the conclusion I felt as though I had experienced all roles related
to the Institute except, perhaps, those of the fund-raiser and funder.
The scheduled site meetings were of great worth. They provided a formal
setting in which we were able to share observations and impressions, ask
questions of each other, and begin to plan for the work to be done upon
our return. </blockquote>
Despite some problems during the July Intensive with library accessibility,
computer resources, and residential conditions—problems that were addressed
at the time and are being more fully addressed as the Institute plans for
a second July Intensive in 1999—the experience was very useful for the
participants. In summary, one Fellow wrote: 
<blockquote>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute “opened its doors” literally
and figuratively to building relationships and producing knowledge at a
professional level for teachers spanning the “distances” of locale, experience,
content/discipline, level, culture, age, race, sex, certification, interest,
and talent. The collaborative spirit and disposition of this diverse group
provided multitudinous opportunities to learn from one another in an environment
that was imbued with mutual respect, trust, professionalism, cooperation,
collaboration, sensitivity, and most importantly the pursuit of excellence.
These characteristics are, decidedly, what contributes to the success of
the Institute and will most impact replicated models. </blockquote>

</p><p>During the July Intensive Session a draft news release was given to
the participants announcing the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute National
Demonstration Project. That news was then released to the press on July
28, along with appreciative and laudatory comments by United States Representative
Rosa L. DeLauro, Theodore R. Sizer (Chairman, Coalition of Essential Schools),
and several other educators and policy-makers. (For the full texts of these
statements, see the Appendix.) 
</p><p>United States Senator Christopher Dodd said: 
</p><blockquote>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute’s innovative effort to
promote and foster the educational partnership between Yale University
and the New Haven Public School system is the beginning of a potential
revolution in American education—a revolution spurred by a desire to better
educate American children . . . . We all talk a great deal about improving
our public schools, but in New Haven it is more than talk. </blockquote>
United States Senator Lieberman said: “This is just the kind of innovative
partnership we must develop and replicate if we hope to rescue these urban
schools and provide the children who attend them with the education they
deserve.” 
<p>Donald M. Stewart, President of the College Board, said: 
</p><blockquote>On behalf of the College Board, a nearly 100-year-old association
of schools and colleges, I salute the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
for launching its National Demonstration Project. . . . The Institute stands
as one of the great university-school collaborations in education, a pioneering
model integrating curricular development with intellectual renewal for
teachers. We applaud the Institute’s tremendous contribution to the professional
lives of teachers, and we sincerely hope that this project will expand
its model of service to teachers across the country. </blockquote>
Gerald N. Tirozzi, Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education,
United States Department of Education, said: 
<blockquote>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has been a beacon of
hope for what is possible when a significant partner and an enlightened
school district commit to working closely and cooperatively together to
enhance teaching and to improve the teaching-learning process. States and
school districts across the country should pause and look carefully at
the universities and schools that have discovered the power of partnership
as a means for implementing meaningful reform—the results speak for themselves. </blockquote>
David L. Warren, President, National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities, said, “The beneficiaries of these grants will be not
only the three new sites, but all those in the nation who are committed
to the improvement of our public school system. This is a great day for
education in America.” 
<p>The planning directors from the five sites in attendance made clear
the usefulness of the July Intensive Session in helping them to understand
the procedures and the spirit of the Institute. One said that all six members
of the team “left New Haven excited about the possibility of participating
in the Demonstration Project.” This planning director added: “It was not
until I was able to see the enthusiasm of the Yale faculty members and
the New Haven teachers for the program that I was able to fully appreciate
how real the collegiality between the two groups is and how the teachers
have been empowered by their experiences in ‘driving’ the program.” 
</p><p>Another planning director wrote: 
</p><blockquote>The July Intensive Session experience greatly influenced many
of the decisions that we have made. The most valuable experiences were
participating in the seminar experience and observing the National Seminars.
The teachers have used their seminar experience to give valuable input
to the rest of us. They have shared their varying images of the role of
the seminar leader, the pedagogy of the seminar conduction, and the writing
of the curriculum unit . . . . These experiences affected our decision
making process throughout the planning phase, and were valuable when describing
the intended institute and its activities. </blockquote>
Another planning director wrote: 
<blockquote>The role of Seminar Coordinator was particularly interesting–how
these teachers serve as organizers and as those responsible for contacting
Fellows who are consistently tardy, absent, or not keeping up with their
reading and writing, thus freeing the seminar leader from those responsibilities
that tend to detract from the role of colleague and which might thus set
him or her apart from the Fellows in an unfavorable way. . . . It is the
best model, without a doubt, for encouraging interaction of university
faculty with public school teachers. The YNHTI’s support . . . . provides
the considerable guidance for replication of the project that is absolutely
required to make this expansion work. We would not be willing to “go it
alone” without the experience of the Intensive session. </blockquote>

<td width="85%"><a name="c"></a><b>Approaching the Implementation Phase</b>
<p>The National Panel concluded that four sites had distinct advantages
as demonstration sites, though some concerns about budget and organizational
structure remained to be resolved. The Panel, including the Program Officer
of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, urged the Director of the Institute
to continue working with these sites. It was evident that an array of four
sites would give the National Demonstration Project a greater diversity
of institutional type, urban scope, and organizational strategy. It would
establish a larger base for collaboration among the demonstration sites.
In case of some insurmountable difficulty at any one site, it would provide
a firmer guarantee of three demonstration sites reaching a successful conclusion.
And if all four sites were successful, it would provide an excellent coast-to-coast
nucleus for further expansion of a league of Teachers Institutes. The Program
Director of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund concurred with this
view. After further negotiation, Implementation Grants were therefore awarded
to Teachers Institutes at Pittsburgh, Houston, Albuquerque, and Irvine-Santa
Ana. 
</p><p>At each Teachers Institute, planning is under way for mounting local
seminars. In Pittsburgh there will be four seminars, two led by faculty
members from Chatham College and two by faculty members from Carnegie Mellon
University. Their topics are “Newspapers: Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow”;
“American Culture in the 1950s”; “Physics, Energy, and Environmental Issues”;
and “Multicultural Literature: French African and Creole Writers.” In Houston
there will be six seminars: “Symmetry, Patterns, and Designs” (Mathematics
and Computer Science); “Hollywood Distortions of History”; “The United
States in the 1960s”; “Technology and the Discipline of Chemistry”; “The
History, Economic Base, and Politics of Houston”; and “Addressing Evil.”
In Albuquerque there will be four seminars: “Archeoastronomy”; “Environmental
Impacts of Human Settlement and Urbanization on the Albuquerque Region”;
“Architecture in the Southwest”; and “Political Culture in New Mexico.”
In the UCI-Santa Ana Institute there will be six seminars: “World Mythology”;
“Film and History”; “Law and Morality”; “Multicultural Literature”; “Mathematical
Concepts”; and “Psychology and Social Behavior.” 
</p><p>An Orientation Session was planned for January 8-9, 1999, in New Haven
in which teams from each site, including the director, university faculty,
and school teachers, will participate. The purpose of the session will
be to hear directly the plans made by the sites for the Institutes they
are creating and to begin to provide as much practical assistance as possible
in the ongoing development of those plans.

<td width="85%"><a name="d"></a><b>National Accomplishments</b>
<p>What has been and what can be demonstrated to the educational community
by those sites that have been or may be awarded Implementation Grants?
Each site has its own distinctive pattern of needs and resources; each
is at a somewhat different stage of development; and each in certain ways
may serve as a model for the establishment of Teachers Institutes elsewhere
in the United States. They will illustrate different patterns of relationship
to state mandates, local resources, and institutional apparatus–and the
state-funded universities will be especially interesting in this regard.
Each site also has gone through a distinctive process in arranging for
a director. 
</p><p>Houston, the fourth largest city in the nation, has a school district
of great economic and demographic diversity. The University of Houston,
a state-supported research institution and a metropolitan university, draws
most of its students from the Houston area. It has had experience with
a program, “Common Ground,” devoted to expanding the canon of literary
texts in high school English courses, that was based in part upon work
in the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. Houston will now work more fully
with 18 self-selected middle and high schools (enrolling 31,300 students)
to establish a teacher-driven program that will address the needs of this
ethnically and racially mixed student-body, a large proportion of whom
are non-English speaking. It will mount six seminars in the first year
of a partnership that is already planned for six years, twice the length
of the Grant. It is possible that the Houston Teachers Institute will be
able to draw upon faculty from other Houston institutions of higher education
in later years. At this site an experienced planning director, William
Monroe, who has directed the “Common Ground” project, will serve as unpaid
advisor to the Director, Paul Cooke, who has been a Visiting Assistant
Professor.

</p><p>Pittsburgh has a school district about twice the size of New Haven’s,
with 41,000 students in 93 schools. The demonstration involves a partnership
of two institutions of higher education, Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon
University, which have long had collaborative arrangements in the area
of teacher preparation. Chatham brings to the collaboration previous experience
in teacher certification and the strengths of a small liberal arts college;
Carnegie Mellon brings the strengths of a university with a strong program
in the sciences. The partnership plans to work with 20 elementary, middle,
and high schools, representing the three regions of the district, which
have volunteered to take part. The Pittsburgh Teachers Institute will mount
four seminars, two led by Chatham faculty and two led by Carnegie-Mellon
faculty. 
</p><p>At this site Helen Faison, an experienced school administrator, now
chair of the Education Department at Chatham College, will serve as Director,
with the assistance of Barbara Lazarus, Vice-Provost at Carnegie Mellon,
who has been designated institutional representative, and Anne Steele,
Vice-President at Chatham, who will help in the relations between those
two institutions. There is the long-term possibility here of expanding
the partnership at some future date to include yet other institutions of
higher education in Pittsburgh.

</p><p>Albuquerque has a school district more than twice as large as Pittsburgh’s,
or four times as large as New Haven’s—85,800 students in 121 schools—enrolling
a high percentage of Hispanic students from low-income families. The University
of New Mexico is the flagship state institution of higher education with
a history of attention to teachers’ professional development and outreach
to the minority community. This partnership seeks to focus upon the problem
of high attrition rate in the schools, and has selected 22 middle and high
schools where that problem is most serious. The partnership seeks to establish
the relevance and interest of a teacher-driven program in a financially
under-supported system by focusing its four seminars on topics that link
the Southwest and contemporary issues. This is a site at which the University
has given special priority to the obtaining of state funding. The President
has selected the Teachers Institute as the project for the College of Arts
and Sciences, and has selected on-campus technological professional development
as the project for the College of Education. If funding is granted by the
State Legislature, it is fairly certain to be continued in future years.
This support could help demonstrate the potential at Teachers Institutes
for state support. Because this Institute will add an independent qualitative
assessment of students, not funded by the Grant, it will provide an additional
kind of information concerning the success of curriculum units. 
</p><p>At this site it was decided to have a co-directorate. Wanda Martin,
who has administered the Freshman English courses at the University of
New Mexico, will have a half-time position here for the duration of the
Grant. Laura Cameron, who has administered the Freshman Mathematics courses
at the University of New Mexico, and who was planning director during that
phase of the project, will also have a half-time position here for at least
seven months, and longer if necessary. The partnership hopes to find a
teacher from the school district who can obtain half-time leave and join
Wanda Martin as Co-Director. If this should prove possible, it would be
a very interesting experiment in the administrative linking of the university
and the public school system through the Teachers Institute.

</p><p>The situation at the University of California at Irvine-Santa Ana Teachers
Institute is yet more complex. Santa Ana is a city somewhat larger than
Pittsburgh, with 53,800 students in nearly 50 schools, but it has become
an ethnic enclave surrounded by more affluent communities. It is a city
in which more than 90 percent of the students are Hispanic. Of the students
69 percent, and over 90 percent in elementary school, have only a limited
knowledge of English. The University of California at Irvine, in an adjacent
city, has a primarily white faculty and a student body more than half of
which is Asian American or Pacific Island. The partnership has decided
to focus on 26 elementary, middle, and high schools, representing all four
areas of the Santa Ana system. It seeks to address the curriculum needs
of the system as it provides curriculum and teaching styles that will support
learning among students with limited knowledge of English. In doing so,
the new Teachers Institute may encounter special difficulties. California
has recently prohibited bilingual education and the use of affirmative
action policies in admissions to the state system of higher education.
There is an opportunity to show that Institute curriculum units work well
in this bilingual environment. Because this Institute also intends to add
a student-assessment component to its adaptation, correlated with state
standards and supported by funds outside the Grant, it will also show how
the Institute approach confronts the pressures of system-driven curriculum
and assessment.

Al-Bayati, who has been the Liaison Officer in the Center for Educational
Partnerships at the University.

the University of New Mexico, the new Institutes will also show how seminars
in the arts and sciences can be provided where there are already programs
in Education or teacher certification.

<td width="85%"><a name="e"></a><b>Learning in New Haven</b>
<p>Throughout this year of planning, the staff and the Implementation Team
of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute have become increasingly convinced
that there is no substitute for direct observation and participation in
the process of getting acquainted with the principles and practices of
the Teachers Institute. We also are learning as individuals from our participation
in this project. New Haven teachers are gaining experience on the national
scene, exercising leadership and establishing relations with their colleagues
elsewhere. They are also rediscovering, when they hear the teachers at
other sites, how unusual and valuable the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
is for them as an opportunity. University faculty members are gaining a
heightened sense of being part of a national community of concerned educators.
We are watching carefully the organizational arrangements and the funding
initiatives at each site for any clues they may provide that will be of
benefit to our own operation. Certain of the seminars offered at the four
sites may alert us to topics that have been inadequately explored by the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. We look forward especially to work in
science and mathematics in this respect, where our own offerings have sometimes
not been as full or as adventurous as we might hope.

<td width="85%"><a name="f"></a><b><i>On Common Ground</i></b>
<p>With support in part from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the
Institute had prepared one number of its periodical, <i>On Common Ground</i>,
during 1997, which was published as Number 8 (Winter 1998). As noted in
the Annual Report for 1997, the theme for this Number was “Building Partnerships
for Our Children.” The distinguished contributors included among others
Gerald N. Tirozzi, Assistant Secretary for Elementary and Secondary Education
in the U. S. Department of Education; John Brademas, Chairman of the President’s
Committee on the Arts and Humanities; Gene I. Maeroff, who directs the
Hechinger Institute on Education and the Media at Teachers College, Columbia
University; J. Myron Atkin, Professor of Education at Stanford University;
Russell Edgerton, formerly president of the American Association for Higher
Education; and David L. Warren, President of the National Association of
Independent Colleges and Universities. These contributors helped to assess
what school-university partnerships have accomplished in the last fifteen
years and what challenges now face such partnerships. 
</p><p>The Editorial for Number 8, “Taking Stock and Looking Ahead,” surveyed
the four years of publication of this periodical, noting the high points
in each Number, and making clear the scope and sequence that had been planned
and supervised by the Editorial Board. The Editorial also set forth a summary
of the Institute’s year of planning for a National Demonstration Project
that might be supported by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. It
noted that the Project would be documented by persons working closely with
the Institute and by persons at the demonstration sites. And it concluded
that <i>On Common Ground</i> itself will have great potential as a means
of disseminating their experience and their results to a wider readership
of those interested in university-school partnership. 
</p><p><i>(image of </i>On Common Ground, Number 8<i> available in print form)</i>
</p><p>Letters to the Institute and “guestbook” entries on the Institute’s
web site, which contains the text of <i>On Common Ground</i>, have testified
to the usefulness of this periodical. A teacher in Hong Kong requested
a subscription. A college teacher in the Philippines wanted a back issue
in order to encourage his librarian to subscribe. And a college teacher
of Education in Arizona wrote: “For three years I have used the Fall 1995
issue of <i>On Common Ground </i>as one of the reading texts for a course
in teaching through the arts for elementary education interns. . . . I
hope the Institute sees fit to follow in the near future with other issues
and writings that enlighten us all with more understanding of how the arts
can empower the teacher/student/curriculum relationship.” 
</p><p>During 1998, because funding had not been received for this purpose,
no further Number of <i>On Common Ground </i>was published. The Institute
continues to seek special funding to enable the continuation of <i>On Common
Ground </i>as a means of disseminating the progress of the National Demonstration
Project. In the meantime, it is reorganizing the Editorial Board so that
it will include adequate representation from the new Teachers Institutes
in the Demonstration Project. It is also working on Number 9, intended
for Fall or Winter 1999, which will be the Number already designated by
the Editorial Board as focusing on “Urban Partnerships.” It will feature
the National Demonstration Project and will include essays by participants
in the new Teachers Institutes.

<td width="85%"><a name="g"></a><b>Looking Toward the Future</b>
<p>It is clear that this first year of planning has been remarkably successful
in establishing a league of Teachers Institutes that stretches from coast
to coast. It is important that each site begin to think of itself as a
full member of this league, receiving advice and assistance from the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute, and being monitored as necessary by this Institute,
but nonetheless developing a significant collegiality with all the other
sites. The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute wants to foster in other Teachers
Institutes both a commitment to its principles and a necessary independence.
One task for the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is obviously that of
encouraging each site to learn how to proceed independently in its distinctive
circumstances, and cooperate with other sites, while yet remaining true
to the approach that we have laid down. On the basis of this preliminary
success, we can look forward with appropriate caution and prudence to the
possibility, if adequate funding can be obtained, of a second phase of
demonstrations. Certainly the visibility of this National Demonstration
Project would be greatly enhanced by some expansion of the league now established
even before the end of this three-year grant.

<td width="85%"><a name="k"></a><b>National Program Documentation and Evaluation</b>
<p><a name="l"></a><b>Internal Documentation and Evaluation</b>
</p><p>Extensive and complex processes of evaluation, with elaborate questionnaires
for Fellows and seminar leaders, have always been part of the procedures
of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. Such evaluation has been extremely
important in persuading funders, the University, and others of the value
of this effort. It has also been important as a continual self-monitoring
that helps the Teachers Institute to chart its course into the future.
For these reasons our Request for Proposals for the National Demonstration
Project requires that each of the new Teachers Institutes engage in very
similar kinds of internal evaluation. Each is committed to undertaking
at its own cost, in cooperation with the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute,
an annual review of the progress of the project. Each partnership will
assume responsibility for a continuing self-evaluation. 
</p><p>Such internal documentation and evaluation at each site will become
part of a more comprehensive evaluation undertaken by the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute and embodied in its annual and final reports to the
DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. The four new Teachers Institutes will
therefore provide Institute staff, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
Implementation Team, and other documenters sent by that Institute with
full access to their activities and their documentation, including school
and university personnel and sites. Significant failure to reach stated
goals of the demonstration, or to maintain the demonstration in accordance
with the conditions agreed upon, could result in the termination of the
funding. 
</p><p>Each Teachers Institute will submit interim financial reports, annual
narrative and financial reports, and a final narrative and financial report.
The contracts with the several sites spell out in detail the necessary
contents of these reports. 
</p><p>The financial reports will contain interim and annual financial accountings
of expenditures made under the terms of this Agreement, including verification
of cost-sharing. They will set forth in detail the cost of operating the
Institute, will provide a documentation of other funds allocated to the
Institute, and will indicate the availability of long-term funding sources.
The final report will provide such accounting for the full term of the
Grant. 
</p><p>The annual narrative reports, which will not exceed 20 double-spaced
pages, will include as attachments two copies of all brochures, schedules,
seminar proposals, curriculum units, questionnaires, reports, and news
articles. 
</p><p>The first report, and later reports if relevant, will explain how the
new Institute is addressing certain concerns that were noted on the occasion
of the awarding of the Grant. The first report will also describe the scope,
the strategy, and the demonstration goals of the new Teachers Institute.
It will explain the process by which it has been established and maintained,
the ways that it has adapted the New Haven approach, its current activities,
and the progress made toward the specific goals of the site’s demonstration.
Subsequent reports will include continuing description of the Institute’s
activities and progress. 
</p><p>Each report will also include: 
</p><blockquote>1. Evidence that the new Institute is faithful to the key parts
of the New Haven approach (the Basic Commitments outlined in the Request
for Proposals for Implementation Grants);
<br/>2. A summary description of the curriculum units developed by participating
teachers, with information about the teachers’ classroom use of the units
and any other outcomes of their participation;
<br/>3. A description of the relationship between participating school teachers
and university faculty;
<br/>4. An account of the ways in which teacher-participants in the seminars
have exerted leadership in planning the seminars, recruiting teachers,
admitting Fellows to the seminars, monitoring their process, and assessing
their results;
<br/>5. Indication of the incentives for university faculty members and
school teachers to participate;
<br/>6. An analysis of the participation of school teachers in Institute
activities (using surveys and other instruments developed by the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute and modified as needed in conjunction with the
several partnerships) that documents the number of teachers who apply,
the representativeness of the teachers vis-à-vis the entire pool
of teachers eligible to participate, and the teachers’ and faculty members’
assessments of the new Institute;
<br/>7. An account of the assistance from the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
that was needed, obtained, and used;
<br/>8. An analysis of the factors contributing to, and hindering, the success
of the new Institute;
<br/>9. An analysis of the effects of the new Institute upon teacher empowerment,
curricular change, and other issues central to school reform;
<br/>10. Documentation of the partnership’s collaborative work with the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute (including responses to questionnaires
dealing with the July Intensive Session in 1999 and the October conferences
in 1999, 2000, and 2001);
<br/>11. An account of the progress made toward the goal of funding the
new Institute beyond the period of this Grant. </blockquote>
At least once during the grant period, an annual report will include a
survey of the use of curriculum units by Fellows and non-Fellows in the
school system. Each report will also include a summary that sets forth
in brief compass the accomplishments and impact of the demonstration, the
impediments encountered, the unanticipated outcomes, and the lessons learned
thus far. 
<p>The annual reports may also, at the discretion of the partnership, include
information that it has obtained based on assessment of curriculum units
or system-wide surveys of their teachers. Though the sites may also undertake,
and report on, evaluation of students who are being taught by Fellows in
the adaptations, such evaluations will not be supported by the Grant for
this project or any cost-sharing that is contributed to its budget. 
</p><p>The information gleaned from this documentation will be used for annual
conferences and for directors’ meetings, designed to provide continuing
conversation among the sites, to enable comparison and revision of the
demonstrations in progress. It will also be used to inform the Institute’s
dissemination of the results of the project. It should have great usefulness
for each of the demonstration sites in their local management, planning,
and fund-raising. 
</p><p>The final narrative report from the several sites will summarize the
three-year demonstration in terms of the items covered by the annual narrative
reports and will then answer the following questions: 
</p><blockquote>1. What do you think are the most important outcomes, impacts,
and lessons learned from this project?
<br/>2. How has it changed the way in which your institution or other institutions
may address these issues?
<br/>3. What plans do you have for continuing the partnership at your site?
<br/>4. Are there any other observations or reflections that you would now
like to make about your partnership’s work under this grant? </blockquote>
The information contained in these annual and final reports will be transmitted
with the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute’s annual and final reports to
the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. Those reports by the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute will provide its own supplementary interpretation
and assessment of the National Demonstration Project in accord with the
criteria that have been specified in the awarding of the Implementation
Grants.

<p>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and the Institutes established
at the partnership sites will also cooperate fully with an assessment of
the National Demonstration Project that will be commissioned by the DeWitt
Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. The four new Teachers Institutes will therefore
also provide evaluators commissioned by the Fund with full access to their
activities and their documentation, including school and university personnel
and sites. 
</p><p>Edward Pauly, Director of Evaluation for the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund, and Ian Beckford, Evaluation Officer, have explained that
this external evaluation will not be used for grant-monitoring purposes.
All such efforts will be conducted by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.
The Fund-commissioned study will make every effort to complement, and not
to duplicate, the information-gathering activities of the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute: in fact, it will use and incorporate the information
that this Institute collects. 
</p><p>The principal goal for the Fund-commissioned study will be to provide
universities and public school systems throughout the nation with answers
to the questions about organizational strategies, costs, and benefits that
they are likely to have about the National Demonstration Project. There
is the hope that such universities and public school systems will use this
information to create Teachers Institutes in their own communities, using
their own resources. 
</p><p>The National Demonstration Project is a high priority for the DeWitt
Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. The Fund hopes to publicize the project’s
accomplishments and to encourage others to emulate it.</p></td>
