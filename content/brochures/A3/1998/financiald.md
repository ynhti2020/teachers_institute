<td width="85%">During 1998, the Institute received a four-year grant of
$2,546,529 for the establishment of a National Demonstration Project that
would show how the collegial and teacher-driven approach that the Institute
has taken for twenty-one years in New Haven can be adapted to establish
similar university-school partnerships under different circumstances in
other cities. 
<p>The Institute also received a three-year grant of $150,000 from the
McCune Charitable Foundation in partial support of one site in the National
Demonstration Project. 
</p><p>The Institute received $40,000 from the discretionary fund of Yale President
Richard C. Levin to support one New Haven seminar for 1998, and $40,000
from the Camille and Henry Davis Foundation in partial support of seminars
in the chemical sciences in 1999 and 2000. The Institute also received
$30,400 in an allocation from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Undergraduate
Biological Sciences Education Program at Yale University. 
</p><p>The Sherman Fairchild Foundation committed to make a grant of $177,311
to the Institute payable in two installments by January 1999 and January
2000, for the support of New Haven seminars in the sciences. The Horace
W. Goldsmith Foundation provided a two-year grant of $100,000, payable
in two installments, to support operations of the Institute. The Bay Foundation
approved a grant of $10,000 for the Institute’s programs. The Mary and
George Herbert Zimmerman Foundation also provided a grant of $10,000. 
</p><p>There is a serious need at this point for additional funding to sustain
the science seminars in the Institute. All revenue from the Institute’s
endowment is limited to the humanities because of the requirements specified
by the endowment challenge grant provided by the National Endowment for
the Humanities. It is important that the Institute build now a science
endowment of similar size and stability to assure continuing work in the
field. 
</p><p>The Institute also continues to seek funding to enable the continuation
of <i>On Common Ground</i> as a means of disseminating the progress of
the National Demonstration Project.</p></td>
