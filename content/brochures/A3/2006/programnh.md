<tr><td width="85%">From its inception, a tenet of the Institute's approach has been to determine its offerings annually in response to the needs for further preparation and curriculum development that the teachers themselves identify. In 2006 this process, as described later in the report, resulted in the presentation of six seminars, three in the humanities and three in the sciences and mathematics. Teachers' participation in these seminars was greatly assisted by the annual contribution from the New Haven Public Schools.<br/>
<p>With support from endowment income the Institute offered three seminars in the humanities:<br/>

<tr><td width="85%">This seminar focused on how to use photographs actively in the classroom. The participants sought to go beyond using photographs as simple illustrations, and instead analyze the meaning and interpretation of photographs. The seminar looked at individual photographs, studying them for prolonged periods, having conversations about them, trying to determine how and why the photographer chose this particular subject; how the photographer "designs" that subject, through cropping, tonality, point of view, orchestrated luck, type of camera, and many other aspects of photography as a truly creative practice. Participants aimed to understand how photography does not so much copy the world but invents it, through the imagination and situation of the photographer. </td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">Discussions sought to open up photography as a powerful medium for classroom instruction. Fellows agreed on ways to use it to teach the specifics of American history, political and cultural. Beyond that, they explored ways to use it to teach students, and themselves, how to speak and write about the world -- how to summon the right language, how to become engaged thoughtfully with what they see.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">The curriculum units embrace the teaching of reading, writing, history, and critical thinking. James Brochin, a high school teacher of history, focuses on war photography; his goal is to transform students' viewing of photographs, and perhaps even their viewing of the world, from observers to engaged witnesses. Stephen Broker, who teaches high school biology and Advanced Placement environmental science, wrote a unit relying on close analysis of nineteenth- and twentieth-century photographs to examine America's changing perspectives on our natural heritage and how we choose to use natural resources. Jennifer Flood, a kindergarten teacher, addresses New Haven history through photographs. An English teacher of high school students who are at particular risk of dropping out, Sandra Friday invokes Gordon Parks' photography to sharpen students' visual skills, understanding, and communication skills as they interact with images from World War II through the Civil Rights Movement. Deborah Hare, who teaches high school English and journalism, also uses the work of Gordon Parks -- along with that of Lewis Hine, Dorothea Lange, and Margaret Bourke-White -- to teach "photojournalism for social change."</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>

<tr><td width="85%">A teacher of third grade, Roberta Mazzucco aims to further writing instruction; her unit assumes that examining photos is one way to increase students' awareness of details and how point of view, whether of the writer or photographer, influences what an audience sees and feels. Michele Murzak's unit uses photographs of September 11, 2001 to teach fourth-grade students social studies as well as reading and writing. Working with middle-school students in special education, Jacqueline Porter-Clinton uses photographs to teach African American history. Writing instruction is the focus of Malini Prabakar, a sixth-grade teacher; her students will analyze various photographs and interpret them from different points of view, then communicate their thoughts and feelings in writing. Finally Kathleen Rende, who teaches a second-grade class of English language learners, will use photographs from the nineteenth century to the modern era to help her students develop critical thinking and evaluation skills as well as their social studies knowledge.
<p>The seminar leader concluded that Fellows "explored the special power of talking about photographs (instead of merely showing them) to make the past come alive."</p>

<tr><td width="85%">This seminar examined the history and culture of Latinos in the United States since the mid-nineteenth century. Readings and discussions explored patterns of conquest, immigration, settlement, and political activism, as well as the rapid "Latinization" of the United States over the last thirty years. Much of the material addressed the cultural expressions of ethnic Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans, although participants also explored other groups of Latinos and examined the ways that their histories have intersected with broader cultural and political currents in the hemisphere. Topics included the place of Latinos in U.S. schools and in Connecticut specifically, the relationships between Latinos and U.S.-Latin American relations, and changing representations of Latinos in U.S. literature, film, music, education, and social movements.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">Fellows' curriculum units emerged in a time of national and international debate about Latinos, undocumented immigration, and the enforcement of national borders, as the spring 2006 seminar coincided both with Congressional efforts to reform immigration and with political demonstrations throughout the U.S. about immigrant rights. In this context, the Fellows worked to understand Latino history over the past century, they debated contemporary topics such as bilingual education and labor unionism, and they read the work of influential scholars, poets, and fiction writers who have attempted to represent Latino experiences. Participants grappled with the changes underway in the present day as well as the longstanding presence of Latinos in the United States. By crafting a diverse set of units related to U.S. communities of Latin American origin, and by taking on subjects ranging from music to food, muralism to civil rights, Fellows authored a collective response to conditions in the urban Northeast.</td>

<p>María Cardalliaguet Gómez-Málaga, a high-school teacher of Spanish, uses the Mexican and Chicano mural movements to foster students' language study as well as their knowledge of history and culture. A high-school teacher of English and literature, John Donahue probes Latino and American identity through fiction. Tina Pedrolini Caplan, who teaches middle-school social studies, employs oral history to teach students about immigration patterns in her school's neighborhood. Judith Goodrich, a middle-school teacher of history, focuses on civil rights struggles in the Latino community. A middle-school Spanish teacher, Diane Nichols uses cuisine as an angle for study of culture and language. Another teacher of middle-school Spanish, Alexandra Reyes applies music in a similar fashion. Diane Huot, teaching third grade, uses Latino literature as a "cultural springboard" for reading instruction. Waltrina Kirkland-Mullins, teaching language arts and social studies to second and third graders, provides students with a look at the intersections of West African, Puerto Rican, and Cuban cultures by way of the rhythm of the drum. Shannon Oneto, a first-grade teacher, uses holidays as a vehicle for language arts and culture instruction. And Cortney Costa, who likewise works in a dual-language setting, applies a particular work of Latino fiction to teach fourth-grade students literature, reading, and writing.</p>

<tr>
<td width="85%">Historians until recently often overlooked the period in American history just after World War II as they focused on the more obviously tumultuous decade of the 1960s. Yet, as this seminar underscored, in retrospect many of the social developments that peaked in the 1960s actually had their roots in the 1950s. After the war suburbs proliferated, and returning veterans and their wives, with help from the federal government through easy financing, flocked to them to begin their new lives as suburban dwellers. The economy soared, in part through the purchase of consumer durables to fill these new homes. Babies were born in record numbers, a further stimulus to the economy.

<td width="85%">This seminar recognized that beneath the surface harmony and good times were strong social currents. Racial injustice was brought to light in the landmark Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka<i>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</i>. African Americans had by no means been complacent about their place in the social fabric, but now their organized protests and the civil rights movement more fully emerged.
<p>Other groups, too, began to chafe against social constraints. Young people listened to Beat writers like Allen Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac and decided that their own lives as the children of the middle class were boring and lackluster. The Beat movement proclaimed that material goods could be set aside in the search for authenticity and what Kerouac referred to as "IT," thus laying the groundwork for the counterculture that emerged to the consternation of parents in the 1960s. And women in their suburban homes began to feel the discontent that Betty Friedan was to document.</p>

<td width="85%">
<p>During the 1950s the Cold War's repercussions were felt in a fear of subversion that led to McCarthyism. We now know that Soviet spies were indeed at work in this country, but McCarthy went far beyond any evidence to charge hundreds of people, almost all entirely innocent, with subversion.</p>
<p>Fellows' curriculum units addressed this among many other topics. Joseph Corsetti considers "McCarthy v. Murrow," challenging his high-school history students to think about different political systems and their consequences, and to evaluate, through a mock trial, the evidence McCarthy presented to support his charges. Ascertaining truth also absorbed two other units. David Reynolds, a high-school teacher of English, examines the work of the so-called "New Journalists" of the 1960s. At the middle school level, Crecia Swaim looks at the work of the documentary photographer Dorothea Lange and alternative records of reality. Targeting fourth graders developing literacy skills while studying history, Christine Elmore focuses on three individuals of the period whom she sees as agents of change -- Elvis Presley, Malcolm X, and Rachel Carson.</p>

<td width="85%">Sean Griffin, recognizing the attraction of fast-paced and active reading to win his students over to poetry, introduces his middle-school English students to some of the protest poetry of the 1950s and 1960s and then asks them to participate in a poetry slam as a final project. A high-school teacher of English, Kristen Grandfield looks to ancient Greek rhetoric for inspiration to coach her students in persuasive writing, using as models famous speeches of the 1950s and 1960s. A teacher of English at the middle-school level, Mary Lou Narowski calls on each of her students to choose one year from the decade of the 1950s and develop for that year a complete newspaper with as many of the features of a regular newspaper as possible.
<p>Fellows in this seminar found their richest source in the civil rights movement. Lucia Rafala, a library media specialist in an elementary school, begins her unit in the time of slavery and moves forward to the 1960s on what she called "The Road to Equality." Teaching English and social studies in the middle grades, Kevin Inge uses the work of Dr. Martin Luther King to emphasize the ways in which his life and work can teach students important lessons in leadership. Joanne Pompano, a teacher of the blind and visually impaired, examines the early beginnings of the disability rights movement, which drew energy from veterans with disabling war wounds from World War II.</p>

<tr><td width="85%">This seminar focused on architecture to foster the teaching of mathematics. The premise was that architecture is a profession where the arts and sciences fuse to create environments for human habitation. The inclusion of a project to design and construct a model provided each Fellow an opportunity to experience how making things encourages learning. As the seminar leader envisioned the seminar, natural resources form the basis for people to create environments. The processes for designing and constructing objects, buildings, or environments demand applied knowledge, including of mathematics. Beauty rises from the embrace of the visual delight, the perfection of function, and the efficiency of operation for the intended purpose. Architects may experiment with design, with material, and with construction methods to bring beauty to the design process.

<tr><td width="85%">The seminar explored how the natural environment not only provides the materials for projects, it also provides the sources for variations of structural geometries, light, thermal, olfactory, audio, tactile, air flow, and material durability. Physical and mechanical properties of each material are important. How material pieces are formed, cut, molded and connected provides the designer with critical information. The size, strength, stability, and durability of each architectonic piece depend on the translation of basic data into realistic form and performance requirements. Movement, rhythm, repetition, vibration all emerge from the material, the relationships, and the connectivity of abstract ideas to real objects. Even music, the seminar leader posited, is composed with beauty firmly anchored in human understanding of composition and applied mathematics. Historical precedents exist as illustrations of thoughtful achievements to learn about successes and failures in our built environment. Historical, and cultural, examples inform design processes in the search for new forms, materials and applications.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">This seminar's resulting curriculum units addressed such topics as Roman aqueducts, bridges, cultures, music, geometric forms, and housing, each with a wide range of mathematical applications suitable for the kindergartner as well as for the advanced twelfth-grade level. Jennifer Esty, who teaches science in a transitional program to prevent young pregnant women from dropping out, will have students combine math, technology and art in the creation of gingerbread houses. Sunny Jonas aims to teach her kindergarten students to engage their senses to promote writing, reading, mathematics, composition, and conversation. An instructional coach who has taught in the elementary grades in a bilingual setting, Pedro Mendia-Landa seeks to integrate architectural mathematical concepts into daily life by helping students observe the environment around them by paying attention to details that can then be quantified, tabulated, measured, graphed, and analyzed, and by allowing students to see the relationships between design and application of measurement, arithmetic, and geometry in the completion of a structure. Ralph Russo, teaching world history at the high-school level, seeks to raise awareness of basic, yet historic, principles of architecture as they apply to the provision of water to an urban center; the architecture of a Roman aqueduct is the focus of his study, which encourages proficiency in quantitative skills, language arts, and organizational skills. Kenneth Spinka connects math to geodesic domes; he and his high school students will design and construct a dome. Donna Wade employs bridges as a vehicle for math instruction in her high-school classroom.</td>

<b>Engineering in Modern Medicine</b></td>

</tr>
<tr><td width="85%">This seminar emphasized how dramatically the practice of medicine has changed in recent decades. For example, couples can test for pregnancy in their homes, a new vaccine is available for chicken pox, ultrasound imaging is available to follow the progress of pregnancy, and small reliable pumps can administer insulin continuously for diabetics. Over a century, the progress has been profound. Life expectancy increased from 50 in 1900 to almost 80 by 2000. People are living longer because they are not dying in situations that were previously fatal, such as childbirth and bacterial infections. The growth of biomedical engineering is a major factor in this extension of life and improvement of health. Biomedical engineers have contributed to every field of medicine -- from radiology to obstetrics to cancer treatment to emergency medicine. </td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">The seminar investigated some of the biomedical engineering innovations that have improved patient care. Participants looked at the science underlying these innovations, the design of medical devices, and (in some cases) the mathematics that governs the principles of their operations. The first part of the seminar focused on technologies that have enabled biomedical engineering to enter the modern era: recombinant DNA technology, cell culture technology, and antibody technology. These topics led to a discussion on vaccine development. The group devoted two weeks to drug delivery systems, starting with the conventional forms of drug delivery, such as injections and pills, before expanding to consider new systems, such as stents and transdermal patches. With this information on drug delivery as background, participants discussed the role of engineering in cancer treatment including imaging, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The final weeks of the seminar covered dialysis and other blood treatments, artificial organs, and biomedical imaging. The discussions were supplemented with drafts of chapters from a book in progress, <i>Biomedical Engineering: Bridging Medicine and Technology</i>, by the seminar leader and Veronique Tran. (The textbook is scheduled for publication in 2007.)

<td width="85%">This seminar was based on the assumption that the student's creation of art enriches his or her learning in the sciences. Much of the history of art is dominated by depictions of the human body. From the earliest caveman drawings to Da Vinci to the contemporary digital images of the Visible Human, there is a rich history of efforts to understand our own bodies through art. The use of art encourages tactile and visual learners to express themselves as well as develops spatial and artistic skills in students with other learning styles. The seminar was designed to appeal to teachers at all levels in subjects ranging from the health sciences, biology and psychology to art. Topics included:
<ul>
<li>How depiction of the human body has evolved through the ages and how the social, cultural and scientific environment has affected that depiction.
</li><li>How schematic diagrams of the body may be used to clarify complexity.
</li><li>How cross-sectional representations of the body are understood and how they can enhance our ability to see three-dimensionally.

Alison Kennedy's unit uses art exercises to teach elementary-grades students about their bodies and how health can be enhanced by making good decisions. Barbara Natale focuses on art projects that teach the skeletal system to fourth- and fifth-grade students. Marisa Ferrarese's unit is the first of three that concentrate on the brain and the senses. Her unit, targeted to fifth-grade students, uses examination of art and medical imaging to stimulate inquiry about the five senses. Heidi Everett examines the brain and senses at a level appropriate for high-school students; her lessons aim to incorporate Howard Gardner's multiple intelligences. Justin Boucher's unit is designed to introduce through schematic diagrams the connections of the brain in an AP psychology course. Finally Sara Thomas, an art teacher, developed a unit for high-school students that examines the musculoskeletal basis of movement while furthering their knowledge of the structure of joints.

<td width="85%">Between October and December 2005, the teachers who served as Institute Representatives and Contacts for their colleagues had canvassed other teachers throughout New Haven elementary, middle, and high schools to determine the topics they wanted Institute seminars to address in 2006. (Please see Appendix for lists of teacher leaders.) The Representatives met together twice monthly and communicated individually with the school Contacts with whom they were responsible for staying in close touch. The Director and Associate Director of the Institute then approached Yale faculty members who were qualified and willing to lead seminars that engaged the desired topics. The Representatives then considered and selected from among their seminar proposals.</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="85%">In their evaluations, the 2006 Fellows indicated that the Institute Representative for their school had been helpful in many ways: by encouraging and assisting them to apply to the Institute, maintaining frequent contact with them, asking for their views on seminar subjects for the following year, and promoting the use of Institute-developed curriculum units. (Chart 1, reading from left to right, moves from the more helpful to the less helpful activities of the Representatives.) As a result, 44 (85 percent) of all Fellows said in the end that they had, while the program was being planned, sufficient opportunity to suggest possible topics for seminars. This is comparable to the rate of satisfaction indicated by the Fellows in 2003, 2004, and 2005 (80, 76, and 71 percent, respectively).

<tr><td width="85%">Having worked with teachers in their respective schools during the preceding months, the Institute Representatives met on January 3 to receive for distribution in all schools copies of the Institute application form, brochure, and descriptions of the seminars to be offered. At this meeting a general presentation of the subjects of the seminars ensured that all Representatives could explain to their colleagues the purpose of each seminar. On January 10 the Institute held an open house for prospective applicants where any teacher might learn more about the planned seminars from the Representatives and from the seminar leaders, who made brief presentations about the seminars they would lead and conducted discussions in small groups with teachers who might apply. One typical Fellow found the event "helpful in giving people an idea of what to expect" and how to "find a unit topic to write for their grade level." On January 17 and 24 the Representatives met to discuss their progress in working with prospective applicants and to hand in their own completed applications. The final deadline for teachers applying to the Institute was January 31. This date was selected so that teachers would apply in advance of the February school vacation. The office would then have the vacation period to process application materials, and the review of applications could be completed during February to provide the earliest possible notification to teachers who were accepted.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">There are four principal criteria for teachers to be eligible for consideration as Fellows:
<ul>
<li>The applicant must be a current New Haven school teacher who will be teaching in New Haven also during the school year following Institute participation.
</li><li>The applicant must agree to participate fully in the program by attending and coming prepared to all scheduled meetings and by completing research and meeting due dates in the preparation of a curriculum unit.
</li><li>The teacher must demonstrate in the application that his or her specific interests are directly related to the seminar as it has been described by the seminar leader. 
</li><li>The applicant must also show that the seminar and the curriculum unit that he or she proposes to write are directly related to school courses that he or she will teach in the coming school year.
</li></ul>
</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">For many years it has been the policy of the Institute to allow no more than twelve teachers to enroll in any seminar. The small size of the seminars is necessary both for the collegiality of the Institute experience and for the individual attention that each teacher's work in progress receives from the seminar leader and from other teachers in the seminar. The Institute has aimed each year to gauge the amount of teacher interest in order to offer enough seminars to accommodate almost all teachers who wish to participate. During the planning process 114 teachers expressed definite interest in participating in one of the seminars to be offered. Of those teachers, 54 were from high schools, 18 from middle schools, 17 from elementary schools, and 25 from K-8 schools. By the application deadline, the Institute Representatives, assisted by the school Contacts, had obtained applications from 77 of these elementary, middle, K-8, and high school teachers in the humanities, social sciences, and sciences.</td><td valign="top">

<tr><td width="85%">
<p>The Fellows application form calls for the interested teachers to specify the subjects and grade levels they teach, the course or courses in which they plan to introduce the material they study in the Institute, and their willingness to meet each of the Institute's requirements for full participation. The applicants also write a brief essay describing why they wish to participate in the seminar to which they are applying, and how the curriculum unit they plan to write will assist them in their own teaching. Writing this essay is, in effect, their first step in formulating a curriculum unit through which they will bring the material they study from the seminar into their own teaching.</p>
</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">A team application form requires interested teachers to demonstrate how the team envisions working together in inter-grade and/or interdisciplinary ways and to outline plans for a culminating activity in the school. Teams may receive preference during the admissions process, and are required to submit a final report on their work together during the following school year. If a team is not admitted as such, however, the members of the team may be admitted to the program as individual Fellows. Also, the Institute encourages all Fellows to work as informal teams in their schools.</td>

<tr><td width="85%">To continue to support the school district's efforts to attract and retain qualified teachers, the Institute placed considerable emphasis again in 2006 on identifying appropriate ways to assist individuals in their first or second year of teaching in New Haven. Connecticut's Beginning Educator Support and Training (BEST) program requires that new teachers prepare a portfolio --  including lesson plans, student work, videotaped class sessions, and reflection -- in their second year in order to be fully certified. The Institute's work with beginning teachers in 2006 followed a successful three-year pilot (from 2002 through 2004) which showed that the collegial support of the Institute and the development of a curriculum unit could assist new teachers in entering the New Haven Public Schools and, in certain cases, in completing the required portfolio.</td><td valign="top">

<tr><td width="85%">All applications were reviewed by three groups: seminar leaders, school principals, and seminar Coordinators. The seminar leaders examined the applications for their relationship to the seminar subject. This afforded each seminar leader the opportunity, as well, to tailor or enlarge the bibliography for the seminar so that it would address the specific interests of the teachers who would be accepted. At the same time, the applications were reviewed in the applicant's own school; the Institute's Representative for each school provided the school principal a copy of each teacher's application to examine. The intention is to increase awareness within each school of the projects that teachers wish to pursue in Institute seminars, to afford an opportunity for the principal and other educational leaders to examine the relationship between teachers' applications and school plans, and to increase the likelihood that the teachers will have a course assignment in which they can use their curriculum unit. In this review, principals answered the following questions: 
<ul>
<li>Is the applicant's proposal consistent with, and significant for, the curricula and academic plans for your school?
</li><li>List the courses and/or the grade levels where the proposed unit will be used; if there are none, state "none."
</li><li>Will the applicant be assigned next year one or more of these courses in which to teach the unit? 
</li><li>Please indicate any special merits or problems you find with the applications.
</li></ul>
</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">When this procedure was introduced in 1998, Reginald Mayo, Superintendent of the New Haven Public Schools, had written to all principals: "We believe this is a highly promising way for ensuring that the assistance that the Institute provides to individual teachers and to teams of teachers has the best prospect for advancing each school's academic plans." This process informs the consideration of each application, provides each applicant pertinent guidance, and provides an opportunity for Institute Representatives to talk with their principals about the Institute.</td>

<tr><td width="85%">The following examples of principals' comments on the Fellows' applications illustrate how they appreciate the significance and usefulness of the curriculum units that teachers in their school will be designing.
<ul>
<p>[This applicant] will work with the entire science department to continue to develop a range of upper-level science courses.</p>
<p>This appears to be a creative unit that will engage students in learning about concepts in the environmental sciences. Highly recommended.<br/>
</p>
<p>[This applicant] will continue to teach eleventh-grade humanities and Advanced Placement U.S. history, and will develop senior history electives. [He] is an outstanding teacher whose participation will benefit the seminar.</p>
<p>Her proposed curriculum unit relates very well to the fourth-grade curriculum. Her unit sounds very interesting and will serve to motivate students to read about this important era in America's history.</p>
<p>The proposed unit is both timely and meaningful for the students. It is directly connected to the curriculum.</p>
<p>The planned unit of study . . . improves achievement in reading, is aligned with New Haven Public Schools social studies standards and incorporates components of the NHPS social development curriculum.</p>
<p>The unit deals with narrative writing, which is covered in the third-grade curriculum and on the Connecticut Mastery Test.</p>
<p>The proposal is . . . appropriate to the curriculum for our seventh- and eighth-grade social studies classes. I am positive she will also utilize her lesson in her language arts classes . . . . It is wonderful that she truly understands the importance of planning for good instruction. Her ideas are realistic and "fun" for students.</p>
<p>This proposal is directly linked to the curriculum she teaches. With our increasing Hispanic population, the background she will obtain through her involvement with the Teachers Institute will prove valuable to both her students and the school community.</p>
<p>The application fulfills the Connecticut science standards for chemistry.</p>
<p>The proposal directly connects multiple topics in geometry and offers real-world applications of math.</p>
<p>Students will be able to learn how to do research in a specific area of study, biology.</p>

<tr><td width="85%">As in the past, the Institute formed a group of teachers who served as Coordinators to assist with the organization and smooth operation of the seminars. The Director, with the advice of teacher leaders, selects these Coordinators from the group of Representatives who become Fellows and who had earlier helped to select seminar subjects and identify interested teachers.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">There is one Coordinator in each seminar. They act as liaisons between the seminars and a Coordinators committee to facilitate the exchange of information and to provide teacher leadership without diminishing the collegial rapport within each seminar. A seminar Coordinator must be, and must intend to continue as, a full-time teacher in one of New Haven's public schools. A Coordinator accepts the following responsibilities:
<ul>
<li>To work with school Representatives at the conclusion of the application process, to serve on an admissions committee to consider proposals for curriculum development submitted by teachers applying to become Fellows, and to make recommendations to the Director about whom to accept as Fellows.
</li><li>To monitor the progress of a seminar through observation and conversation with participants, and to give progress reports at weekly seminar Coordinators committee meetings.
</li><li> To report to the seminar members any organizational information which should be circulated, such as the schedule of any visitors and notice of Institute-wide activities.
</li><li>To act as a resource for members of the seminar, providing information about unit-writing deadlines, guidelines for writing curriculum units, computer assistance available to Fellows, copyright procedures, and University facilities Fellows may use.
</li><li>To be available to the seminar leader to provide information on Fellows' perceptions of the seminar and on Institute policies generally, and to offer assistance as may be needed.
</li><li>To assist with the smooth operation of the seminar by keeping track of Fellows' promptness and attendance and the timeliness of their written submissions, and by encouraging Fellows to make and keep appointments for individual meetings with the seminar leader.
</li><li>To attend and come prepared to weekly committee meetings with the Director or Associate Director and to take professional days as needed for the above purposes.

<p>The Coordinators work together as an admissions committee for the Institute. They met after school on February 1 to conduct a first reading and discussion of the applications to their respective seminars. They then contacted all teachers whose applications needed to be clarified or amplified. On February 8 the Coordinators met for a full day, by taking professional leave, for their final consideration of most applications. They met again on February 14 to resolve issues remaining in a few applications.</p>
<p>During their review, the Coordinators considered the findings of the school administrators and seminar leaders and made recommendations to the Director about which teachers the Institute should accept. By these means, the Institute seeks to ensure that all Fellows participate in seminars that are consistent with their teaching assignments and applicable in the courses they teach. The Institute accepted as Fellows 65 New Haven teachers, 36 in the humanities and 29 in the sciences and mathematics. A joint meeting of seminar leaders and Coordinators was held February 28 to discuss the admissions process just completed, and to review the seminar and unit writing process and the policies and procedures of the Institute. In this way, the Coordinators began to provide the seminar leaders with information about the teachers who had been accepted and to discuss their role in assisting with the conduct of the seminars.</p>

The Institute first admitted elementary school teachers in 1990; this year nine (14 percent) of all Fellows were elementary school teachers -- a lower percentage than in recent years because of the trend in the district toward establishing more K-8 schools. Twenty four (37 percent) were middle or K-8 school teachers (including several in the elementary grades), and 32 (49 percent) were high school teachers. Overall, 15 Fellows taught grades kindergarten to five, 18 taught grades six to eight, and 32 taught grades 9 to 12.

Twenty percent of Fellows were 41-50 years old; and 33 percent were older than 50.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">As Chart 2 shows, one third of the Fellows (34 percent), had four or fewer years of experience in teaching.

In two fields -- earth science and physics -- no Fellows had a graduate or undergraduate degree.

<tr><td width="85%">At the first organizational meeting of each seminar, held on March 7, the seminar leader distributed an annotated bibliography on the seminar subject and presented the syllabus of readings that he or she proposed the seminar would consider. The Fellows described the individual curriculum units that they planned to develop. This afforded the members of each seminar an overview of the work they were undertaking together and the projects they would pursue individually. The bibliographies both introduced the seminar subject and guided Fellows as they began research on their curriculum units. Several Fellows remarked on the value of their seminars' reading lists. One said, "Readings were appropriate, and adjusted as needed." Another remarked that the seminar leader "offered many supplemental materials in addition to the reading list." Another Fellow said readings "will help in the classroom by helping show students the critical details of history rather than the obvious trite ones." One seminar leader said that despite the varied topics of Fellows' own curriculum units, the seminar "itself, with the syllabus readings," did lay "a groundwork" for those units. According to another, 
<ul>The seminar was more interactive than a typical class of mine at Yale. Because our syllabus and mission was broad, I allowed the Fellows to shape the direction that each meeting took.</ul>

<p>During the period that preceded the regular weekly meetings, Fellows continued their reading, both preparing for the upcoming seminar discussions and working toward a brief prospectus of what their final units would contain. At the second seminar meeting, on April 11, Fellows submitted the prospectus, presented their revised unit topics, and began to discuss common readings. The regular weekly seminar meetings began on May 9; thereafter Fellows continued to develop their units in stages, with a first draft submitted May 30. The weekly meetings of the seminars continued through July 18, with Fellows submitting the second draft of their units July 5 and completed units by July 31.</p>

<tr><td width="85%">Fellows submit the prospectus, together with a revised unit topic and a list of appropriate readings, at the time of the second seminar meeting. This allows them six weeks to write a first draft. The due date for the second draft is late enough to allow Fellows ample time to address the comments they received on the first draft from other Fellows and from the seminar leader. Most Fellows have been satisfied with this schedule and its well-worked-out series of deadlines during the spring and into the summer. Overall, 79 percent of the Fellows (compared with 75 percent in 2005 and 78 percent in 2004) thought the unit writing deadlines occurred at the right time in relation to the school calendar. In contrast to a few who thought the program should conclude either earlier in the spring or later in the summer than it does, in a typical remark one Fellow said, "The Institute is very well-organized and I have always appreciated the timeline and deadlines that keep me 'on track' in meeting obligations." Another "thought the way the due dates worked out was very effective," while another called "careful planning" one of the program's virtues.</td><td valign="top">

Many Fellows commented on the value of following this process -- including not only guidance from the seminar leader but also suggestions from other Fellows. One called the seminar leader "very positive and motivating. I'm sure I worked much harder on my unit simply because I felt guided and encouraged." Another Fellow said, "During the writing process, our leader gave feedback and offered advice on how to improve our units. He was always available to meet with us." Another appreciated how her seminar leader "had great suggestions, extreme patience and was not overbearing; this made me quite comfortable. Overall, my knowledge . . . has increased greatly."

A Fellow in a different seminar said it "contained the perfect balance of sharing lessons plans with providing pertinent information." According to another, "Toward the later seminar meetings we shared and tried out our lesson plans. This was extremely helpful in refining classroom activities for my curriculum." Others said:</p>

<tr><td width="85%">At the conclusion of the seminars, most Fellows indicated that the program schedule (88 percent) and the guidelines for writing a unit (88 percent) had been useful to them to a great or moderate extent. This year half (48 percent) of the Fellows said they tried out the subject matter and three quarters (73 percent) said they tried out the strategies of their units in their classroom. Of those who did, almost all Fellows (85 percent) said the students' reactions influenced what they included in the final units. For example, one middle school teacher of history wrote,
<ul>My seminar did a great deal to address [a] gap in my education. Almost immediately, I had new information to share with my students. . . . When I was able to incorporate this information into my teaching, I saw how excited my students became. . . . One of the topics was the Spanish-American War. . . . Because I knew more about the long-term implications of the war for Puerto Rico, my students were much more enthusiastic about learning about it.</ul>
<p>During the first two months of the program, which serve as a reading period, all Fellows also met together on Tuesday afternoons for a series of talks by current or prospective seminar leaders. These talks are designed either to acquaint Fellows with the work of seminars other than their own, or with subjects of possible future seminars. </p>
<p>Current seminar leaders gave three of the talks: Alexander Nemerov on "Reading and the Imagination: N.C. Wyeth and Robert Louis Stevenson," Mark Saltzman on "Engineering in Modern Medicine," and Stephen Pitti spoke on "Latino Cultures and Communities." Two prospective seminar leaders also gave talks: David Bercovici on climate change, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanoes and the geophysics of "Natural Hazards," and David Katz on "The Care and Feeding of Homo sapiens: Are We Truly Clueless?"</p>
<p>The talks were popular. One Fellow said the talks were "excellent and well received." According to another, they "were always interesting and full of information I was eager to share with my students and other teachers." Another called the talks "a great way of learning about the other seminars and topics in the forefront of research and education." Another characterized the "diversity and quality of the lectures" as "exceptional." Scattered criticisms concerned whether precious time might be used differently. More typical was this comment:</p>
<ul>
The talks were a great strength in the program. Through these talks, I became very interested in some of the topics that the other seminars were discussing, and because of this will be sure to look into the units from those Fellows.

<p>Most Fellows saw in the talks the purposes for which they were organized. Virtually all (98 percent) Fellows said that to a great or moderate extent the talks provided intellectual stimulation, while most (92 percent) said they provided a sense of collegiality and common purpose among Fellows. More than three quarters (83 percent) said the talks were successful to a great or moderate extent in providing an overview of Fellows' work in the seminars. A similarly high proportion (86 percent) said the Institute scheduled the right number of talks. Many Fellows reported that the talks prompted them, to a great or moderate extent, to read about the talk topics (57 percent), discuss the topics with their students (63 percent), and discuss the talks with other teachers (83 percent). These figures were comparable to, or even slightly higher than, those of prior years.</p>
<p>As in other recent years, the Institute scheduled an early workshop on curriculum unit writing. As part of their admissions folder, all Fellows had received Institute guidelines and mechanical specifications for preparing curriculum units, which outline the Institute writing process and the steps for Fellows' formulating, reformulating, and expanding their individual units. On March 21, the teachers serving as seminar Coordinators comprised a panel in leading the discussion on curriculum unit development. </p>

<p>The Coordinators spoke from their own experiences as Institute Fellows in researching and writing curriculum units. They selected for emphasis the topics they thought it was especially important for all Fellows to understand: "Narrowing Your Topic and Considering Your Audience"; "Following the Institute Process for Unit Development"; "Aligning Your Unit with School Plans and District Goals"; "Using Technologies for Research and Writing"; "Using the Institute's Reference Tools"; and "Collegiality and Professional Development: The BEST Portfolio and Beyond." After questions, the Fellows went into seminar groups, where each Coordinator led a discussion of purposes and practices in writing Institute curriculum units. This offered an opportunity for the first-time Fellows to learn about the guidelines and other aspects of curriculum unit writing from experienced Fellows. It encouraged veteran Fellows to share their experience and allowed all to discuss how the completed volume of units might display a range of teaching strategies and contain a standard form of annotation. By leading these discussions, the Coordinators also identified themselves as being knowledgeable about the process of writing curriculum units, so that other Fellows might seek their advice.</p>
<p>On May 31 the seminar Coordinators organized a discussion to recognize and encourage the beginning teachers who were participating as Fellows. This was an opportunity for the experienced Fellows to congratulate their new colleagues for participating in the Institute during their first or second year of teaching, to invite them to seek support from Fellows who had faced similar challenges, and to reflect with them on teaching in New Haven.</p>

<p>At weekly meetings with the Director and Associate Director, held the day after seminar meetings, Coordinators discussed the progress of each seminar and gained an overview of the program. Both seminar leaders and Fellows acknowledged in their evaluations the essential role of the Coordinators. All Fellows agreed (70 percent "strongly") that the Coordinators provided teacher leadership without diminishing the collegial relationship within the seminar. Fellows found the Coordinators to be helpful either a lot (90 percent) or a little (8 percent) in providing information about unit writing deadlines; helpful either a lot (77 percent) or a little (21 percent) in providing information about guidelines for unit writing; helpful either a lot (75 percent) or a little (23 percent) in monitoring the process of the seminar through observation and conversations with seminar members; helpful either a lot (73 percent) or a little (25 percent) in providing information about the use of University facilities; and helpful either a lot (73 percent) or a little (23 percent) in facilitating discussion of Fellows' work in progress. Few Fellows found the Coordinators unhelpful in any respect. Overall they received considerable praise not only from Fellows, but also from seminar leaders. According to one Fellow, "The Coordinator did an excellent job of reminding people of their obligations without being rude" and "offered help to other Fellows." A Fellow in a different seminar said: "Our Coordinator was always actively involved in class discussions and was very helpful." A participant in a third seminar wrote that the Coordinator was "always available, enthusiastic, and helpful." Another called that Coordinator "extremely effective." From another seminar:
</p>
<ul>My Coordinator . . . was of great assistance to me throughout the seminar. He kept a strong line of communication between the leader, himself, and all of the Fellows. This allowed for us to operate as a team . . . comfortably.</ul>
<p>To maintain current information on the program and to address any problems that arose, the Institute Director and Associate Director met monthly with the seminar leaders as a group. This also gave the seminar leaders, four of whom were conducting an Institute seminar for the first time, an opportunity to talk with one another about their approaches and experiences.</p>

<b>Relating Seminar Topics to Curriculum Units</b></td>
<td valign="top"></td>
</tr>
<tr><td width="85%">Each Institute seminar must balance the complementary and inseparable but sometimes competing demands for studying the seminar topic and developing applications of that knowledge for school classrooms. The Fellows, from elementary, middle, and high schools, are obligated to develop curriculum units that have some demonstrable relation to the seminar topic. Yet they are free to devise curricula that enter territory not covered in detail by the seminar. The curriculum units, therefore, have a diversity of subject and method that one would not expect in a regular university course. As a result, discussions in the seminar, while doing justice to the common reading, can also range widely over substantive and pedagogical issues relating to the curriculum units. Some comments by seminar leaders and Fellows quoted earlier have indicated that each seminar approaches these demands differently as seminar leaders strive for an appropriate balance. </td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">The Institute encourages Fellows to incorporate in their curriculum units both subject matter and skills that are called for by the local curriculum framework -- including a strong emphasis upon literacy -- and assessed by the statewide Connecticut Mastery (CMT) and Academic Performance (CAPT) Tests, administered during 2006 in grades three through eight, and ten, respectively. Some Fellows commented on the ways Institute-developed curriculum units help implement aspects of the district curriculum framework and create engaging material for students. One Fellow said of a unit whose "emphasis is on writing" that, "since the unit covers many of the standards and expectations, it will enrich the teaching of writing and social studies." Another's unit provides "a practical way to integrate . . . architecture into math strands/standards." A teacher of science wrote,
<ul>My teaching will be enhanced, more up-to-date and more detailed after this seminar. My students will benefit in the exposure to new and current medical techniques and . . . new career choices. Overall the units produced in this seminar are all relevant and within standards adopted by the city and state . . . . We will all benefit from this seminar as we update our curriculum and introduce our students to the new standards in education.

I use the Institute to generate unique and exciting curricula for my students . . . stylizing lessons that interconnect standards rather than teaching them separately.
<p>As far as the school curriculum goes, I hope this unit will help to get students more interested and excited. It is another way of helping students to increase the amount and quality of their writing.</p>
<p>While I was a participant in the seminar, I also had the privilege of working to rewrite the district's social studies curriculum. . . . I made sure that the experiences and history of Latinos was included in a much more significant way.</p>
<p>My unit will add excitement to my teaching the classical civilizations component of the world history curriculum. It will also add a "hands on" research project . . . [giving] students a meaningful task that reinforces curriculum standards.</p>
<p>The unit I wrote was written with two of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics standards. . . . Students should be presented with real-world problem-solving. . . [and] see the relationship between mathematics and other subject areas.</p>

<p>I was able to develop a comprehensive plan that aligns with both my school's mission and Connecticut state standards. I was also able to use the knowledge of a Yale professor to ensure the accuracy of the information, determine most relevant content, and that it is all current. My students will reap the benefits of the curriculum by using less of their assigned student textbook and more discussion, inquiry-based learning, active participation, creative interpretation, and discovery.</p>
<p>The content of my seminar directly correlates with district standards . . . . I am now more knowledgeable concerning the advances the have been made in medical imaging and this will assist me in teaching my students concerning advances in sciences and technology. The students will also benefit from my increased knowledge of the software and programs available that aid in teaching anatomy.</p>

Just as the opportunity to increase mastery of the subject one teaches was an important incentive for most Fellows (92 percent) at the outset, everyone said they had gained knowledge of their subject and confidence to teach it by participating in their seminar. All Fellows agreed with the statement that the seminar helped with intellectual and professional growth; three quarters (83 percent) strongly agreed. As one put it, "The seminar provided rigorous professional development that kept me cognitively engaged."</td>

<tr><td width="85%">Many Fellows described the Institute experience -- including the research for and writing of curriculum units -- as having increased their professional confidence, subject mastery and morale, while nourishing their own as well as their students' curiosity. One who "wanted to expand my knowledge in an area of literature that I found myself having to teach often" left the seminar "much more confident in my own understanding." Another said, "My hope was to challenge myself intellectually which I certainly did"; the seminar leader "was an excellent teacher from whom I learned so much." Another expects her unit to have "a wonderful effect," having "learned a lot about how our body . . . functions." Moreover, she learned "ways to explain these functions. . . on a level that students easily understand." Another said the Institute "keeps my teaching . . . fresh." Others said:

The seminar has broadened my understanding of architecture and structural engineering. The experience has left me with far more confidence in those areas than I had previously. I expect that my teaching of these topics will improve with this increased knowledge and confidence.
<p>I feel confident in teaching my unit because of the time and support that was put into it. My unit may be taught in the language arts, social studies or social development classroom. I'm excited about teaching my unit!</p>
<p>My experience in the Institute this year was very positive. . . . My initial feelings were overwhelming. . . because of my lack of knowledge on the subject. In this seminar not only did I learn a great deal . . . but also it allowed me to build confidence in my ability to adapt what I learned to teach my students.</p>
<p>Preparation of a unit of this kind with the intensive background information covered certainly is the way in which to properly design and instruct in the classroom. This unit was specifically designed with my students in mind. It is like having a tailor-made suit designed specifically for you. It fits to a tee. The middle school language arts curriculum in New Haven is integrated with social studies curriculum so my unit will definitely be used.</p>
<p>Institute participation always makes me a better teacher, by increasing the depth and breadth of my knowledge and by providing me with more contacts within the New Haven school district. The sense of community developed through participation in the Institute is valuable to me.</p>
<p>I am broadening my knowledge base and certainly making myself a better teacher, better equipped to help my students. My curriculum will also be enhanced . . . because I have discovered new ways to teach poetry and engage students.</p>
<p>Aside from the benefits the students will get from the actual unit, I believe that I am now better prepared to handle some of the questions and confusion that my students may have about their heritage and background.</p>

<p>One Fellow wrote, "The Yale atmosphere and benefits added to this teacher's morale." Other Fellows "liked having access to Yale facilities" and "value using the Yale libraries . . . throughout the year." Another said a "highlight of the seminar was the laboratory tour." A participant in a different seminar said, "We took a trip to the anatomy lab -- what an amazing resource!" Another Fellow in that seminar elaborated,</p>
<ul>We visited the Yale medical laboratory where we observed cadavers, explored the many wonderful systems of the human body and had a hands-on demonstration of how to perform a medical autopsy. We were also able to have a hands-on experience dissecting the human brain. We also attended the Yale Art Gallery to observe the human body depicted in art over the ages and in various genres.

In all, Fellows planned to encourage or assist a total of 243 other teachers. One plans "to share my unit with the teachers in my grade level, as we are all required to teach some aspects of the topics." This, the Fellow said, "will be a good way to expand upon what we are mandated to teach and make the learning more in tune with students." Another said, </p>
<ul>I am better prepared to assist and guide my fellow teachers in creating units for their classrooms.

A Spanish teacher intends "to do a unit along with our history teacher this year since we both participated in the seminar. This should give my subject area a whole new burst in [the] school system." A science teacher's unit treats "such environmental topics as land preservation, species endangerment, energy use, resource use, air and water pollution, and solid waste disposal." He continued, 
<ul>My students will benefit from the lesson plans that I have developed, and I anticipate that they will develop a greater enthusiasm for course materials that I use. In addition, the curriculum units that I have written for use in AP environmental science continue to enrich the district curriculum. . . . A primary goal that I have set for the course is to raise student achievement in the national AP examination. The 2006 curriculum unit I have written is another step forward.</ul>

<p>I believe that the success of my Institute seminar is largely due to our seminar leader, whose knowledge and resources appeared limitless. . . . My fellow Fellows also contributed to the quality of the experience. . . . All were as focused on my success as they were on their own.

The seminars encouraged original thinking and reflecting on significant, contemporary subjects. I am proud to be part of this process.</p>
<p>My participation in the Institute provided many opportunities to strengthen my teaching. My experience with the seminar has increased my awareness of how I can integrate more hands-on activities for the science classroom and how to design the activities so they are more inquiry-based.

<ul>I have used every curriculum unit that I wrote for the Institute. There is no doubt that they enhanced my knowledge and gave me the confidence to try new things in the classroom. . . . One unit I use every year is a curriculum designed to get students who are not college bound interested in going to college. It is also designed for students who think they might want to go to college but have no idea what college is like. . . . Because of the Institute I have a curriculum ready. . . as well as writing assignments. It has even made some kids want to go to college. . . . Another unit I continue to use every year is [on poetry]. Once again, it built my confidence in my ability to teach poetry. Because of this I include some form of poetry in all my English classes. . . . I can't say enough how valuable these seminars are to teachers and therefore to New Haven students.
<p>I have been able to enhance the reading/writing curriculum by teaching my units to students. Quite a few of my units have centered around biographies and because I have become familiar with each figure . . . I am better able to guide my students as they explore the lives of these people in guided reading, shared reading, and independent reading sessions. Because I keep in mind the Connecticut standards as well as my district's initiatives. . . it all fits.</p>
<p>The topics of mathematics and architecture are the perfect match when trying to integrate multiple curricular areas under one theme. Therefore, I was able to explore ways of doing so to enrich the New Haven district's curriculum.</p>

Contrary to what some would expect of a partnership involving Yale University, the Teachers Institute intends to serve students at all achievement and performance levels. Fellows usually, in fact, write their units for students at more than one level. While nearly all of the Fellows (94 percent) reported that their new curriculum units were designed for their "average" students, three quarters (75 percent) reported that they were designed for their "advanced" students and almost as many (65 percent) reported that they were designed for their "least advanced" students. Fellows commented on these multiple purposes. One said her seminar leader "presented these fun and engaging activities with suggestions as to how to modify them for different student populations." Another wrote, 
<ul>My unit will have a direct effect on my teaching because it was a learning process for me as I wrote it. All the research I did had made more informed. . . . It also allowed me to reflect on best teaching practices for the particular group of students for whom the unit was intended. I had to take a good look at their needs as a unique group and design my instruction around that. This was great.</ul>

Another Fellow who expects the curriculum unit "to motivate students greatly" always tries "to innovate in my classes so students participate more actively and work. I believe this unit is going to fulfill these expectations." Another said her unit "should be very practical and useful" in "my teaching of narrative writing" and show students "the importance of detail in their writing." This Fellow observed, "I am excited about using the unit. As with most things, when a teacher is excited about teaching it usually goes better for students." "This," she concluded, "is one of the great positives that comes from participation in the Yale Institute."

Forty nine of the Fellows planned to teach their unit to 20 or more students; 24 said that they would teach their unit to 50 or more students. The total number of students to be taught a unit by this year's Fellows is more than 2500. Chart 6 indicates the lengths of time the Fellows planned to teach their units.

<p>In participating in the Institute I had made the decision to write a unit that would be interdisciplinary based on the interests of all my students. The unit was able to incorporate chemistry, biology, and physics, which will inevitably prove beneficial to the school environment.</p>
<p>My enhanced understanding of DNA technology will help me with the biology course curriculum I'm teaching. Cell culture technology is a topic I think students will find fascinating. . . . Vaccines and antibodies are also an essential part of the biology curriculum, and having specific examples to use in the classroom is very useful. . . . Drug delivery . . .

<tr><td width="85%">We asked Fellows about the extent to which several features of the Institute had been useful to them. As shown in Chart 7 below (reading again left to right from the most useful to the least useful), very few Fellows said that any aspect of the Institute had not been useful. In fact, except for computer assistance -- which many did not use -- each aspect of the Institute was regarded as useful to a great or moderate extent by well over half of the Fellows. All responded that favorably about their seminar leaders and the knowledge gained about their subject, ninety-four (94) percent about the interaction with other Fellows, most also (88 percent) about the guidelines for writing a unit, and about the seminar bibliographies (79 percent). Every Fellow rated the program overall as useful at least to a moderate extent; most (86 percent) called it useful to a great extent.
<p>We asked the Yale faculty who led seminars to provide their conclusions about the strengths and weaknesses of the Institute. Overall, the leaders' assessment was strongly favorable.</p>

<p><i>(Chart 7 available in print form) </i></p><p>One seminar leader who "think[s] highly" of the program believes "the number of teachers who return again and again suggests that it is filling a deep-seated need felt by the teachers themselves to enlarge and enrich the courses that they teach." Others said:
</p><ul>The context and history of the Institute serve as a significant channel for quality education in the public sector. The Institute's support and resources truly influence all the participating Fellows. . . . Not only are the goals of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute commendable, they have been consistently achieved with evolving strength and outreach. It is a significant resource and support for the public school system, both locally and nationally.</ul>

The main strength of the Institute is the long-term (several-month) relationship that develops among the leaders and the Fellows. The number and distribution of meetings gives ample opportunity for the leader to develop as an effective content expert and Fellows to articulate their claims as teaching experts. In this way a meaningful partnership can be achieved. Over the course of many seminars and many years, Yale and New Haven can work to mutual enhancement. The many years of experience at the Institute are evident in the smoothness with which it runs.
<p>I expected this to be a profitable experience for me, and I got more than I expected. My work with the Fellows was invigorating and encouraging. I was impressed to see how such a complex program can be accomplished. The discipline that was imposed by the program administration was incredibly helpful in keeping me and the Fellows on task and working efficiently. The long experience of the Institute, and the lessons that the Institute leadership have learned through the years, was clearly a major strength.</p>

Teachers have input into the subjects of the seminars. . . . I like that the Institute listens to and responds to the teachers' input. This tends to be left out of many other professional development programs. The Institute offers professional development that causes the individual to grow and gain confidence.
<p>Any deficiencies Fellows cited tended to concern the challenge of fulfilling the program's considerable requirements; as one wrote, "the only perceived weakness" was the "time commitment." Another said, "For a first-timer and non-writer, it was difficult to find the most efficient way to put the unit together."</p>
</ul>
<p>Most comments were highly positive. The same "first-timer and non-writer" listed the following "strengths":</p>
<ul>
To learn extensively about the topic, to hear speakers on other topics, to use the Yale facilities, to make new friends, to be supported and inspired by a Yale professor, to be published, to write useable and motivating curriculum, to receive financial help, and to be around an intellectually inspiring environment.
</ul>
<p>Others said:</p>
<ul>
The strengths of the Institute come from the faculty that participate and their level of commitment to the program. I have never participated in the Institute when there was not the highest degree of cordiality and enthusiasm. . . . The fact that you offer computer help and orientation to the libraries is also great.
<p>The Institute offers teachers, both new and seasoned, many wonderful opportunities. Its strengths are many. I especially value being able to "study" under the direction of a Yale professor, interact with other teachers from different schools and grade levels, and design my own curriculum unit related to the seminar.</p>

Aside from scattered concerns about details of scheduling and the workload to which we have alluded, the Institute's offerings were very well received. One Fellow said,
<ul>The Institute is a great program for teachers. You can get a Yale education and get paid for it! The real strength of the program is teachers supporting each other in a relaxed atmosphere. It seems the teachers who participate in the program are dedicated to their teaching. They love what they do. This enthusiasm is contagious and invigorating. Hence, I find the Institute to be therapeutic. One of the major problems in the teaching profession is a teacher working on his/her own island. The Institute gives teachers professional development that will enhance their teaching and the lives of their students.</ul>
<p>In their evaluations, almost all the Fellows said they would participate (75 percent) or might participate (21 percent) in the Institute in one or more future years. These proportions are comparable to those in most prior years. Only two individuals said they would not participate in the future: One will not be "returning . . . because of my intended schedule . . . not because of the Institute," while the other planned to move out of state for personal reasons.</p>

In earlier years the Institute provided teachers computers to use in schools where none were otherwise available to them. It encouraged Fellows to learn about and use e-mail. And the Institute put the New Haven Public Schools' curriculum framework online before the district was able to do so. It placed Fellows' curriculum units online on a gopher server before the Internet existed in its present form. </td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">More recently, as computers have become more widely available, if not ubiquitous; as teachers' use of e-mail has become more routine; and as Fellows' knowledge of computing has become more widespread; the Institute mainly has assisted Fellows in formatting their curriculum units in a manner consistent with its mechanical specifications for units so that they can more readily be put online on the Institute's Web site. Because of the benefits of having curriculum units online, the Representatives had decided that, beginning in 1999, Fellows must submit curriculum units and <i>Guide</i> entries in electronic as well as printed form. Still, in 2006 some Fellows sought help with more basic applications from getting started with computing, e-mail, and the Internet, to using the Internet in research and teaching, and using Institute resources online.
<p>The Institute hires graduate and undergraduate students who offer this computing assistance by phone, by e-mail, or in person. In addition, Fellows may use computing facilities available to members of the University community across the campus. The electronic resources and services available to Fellows include opportunities to learn about and use computing. Perhaps most important, each Fellow receives a University network ID and password which enables them to use databases and other electronic resources available only to members of the Yale community.</p>

For half (53 percent) of Fellows the availability of computer services was an incentive to their participation.

For the third year the Institute provided each seminar with its own e-mail group to facilitate communication.

<tr><td width="85%">
In 1996 the Institute undertook with the New Haven Public Schools a new program designed to broaden and deepen its efforts to strengthen teaching and learning in the schools. It offered several elementary, middle, and high schools the opportunity to establish an Institute Center for Curriculum and Professional Development within their buildings. Five such Centers were established in 1996. Over subsequent years the Institute has articulated and refined the concept of the Centers, prepared policies and procedures for them, and designed, constructed, and delivered special furnishings to them.</td><td valign="top">
</td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">The purpose of Centers is to provide Institute resources to assist teachers in implementing school plans that address district goals. The Institute aims to situate the Centers around the city, targeting especially the larger schools, so that a majority of New Haven teachers will have a Center at their school or at a school near them. During 2006, seven Centers were in operation. They were located at two elementary schools (Columbus and Davis Street), two K-8 schools (East Rock and Fair Haven), and three high schools (Cooperative Arts and Humanities, Hill Regional Career, and Wilbur Cross).
<p>These Centers are not permanent installations but must be regularly renewed. A Center may remain so long as the school has a need and desire for it, and can then be moved to another school. Moving Centers around the school district increases exposure to the Institute and ensures their resources will be located where they will be most beneficial each year. The Steering Committee, which makes these decisions, developed criteria for targeting sites: A suitable site must be of sufficient size, with a critical mass of participants and adequate leadership. It must be able to rely upon a favorably disposed school administration and an appropriate school plan, and be consistent with the aim of allowing most New Haven teachers to have a Center at their school or nearby. </p>

<tr><td width="85%">The Institute and the New Haven Public Schools jointly established Institute Centers to support the system's curriculum reform efforts. The Centers help carry out school-based plans to address the District's "Kids First" goals for student learning, whose strategies include enhanced standards-based curriculum and instruction; "professional learning communities"; parent and community involvement; and improved physical condition of schools. The Centers create in schools a place conducive to the kinds of conversations teachers have with one another and with their Yale colleagues in Institute seminars. Centers increase the visibility and use of Institute resources and include teachers who have not before been Fellows. Fellows using Centers disseminate Institute-developed curriculum units and encourage other teachers to assist with planning Institute seminars and to participate in those seminars.
<p>The Centers operate from attractive and properly equipped rooms in the schools, where the Institute installs special furnishings designed by Kent Bloomer, Adjunct Professor of Architectural Design at Yale, who has led three Institute seminars. Bloomer designed for each Center two pieces of furniture that remind the users that a Center is a way of bringing teachers together as colleagues, and that it is a function of the mutual presence of Yale in the schools and the schools in Yale. Combining utility and symbolism, these pieces have a solidity and elegance in harmony with the tradition of design at Yale University, and an evident durability suggestive of the Institute itself. One piece is a round table, with a hole in the middle, which provides the "center" about which eight people can sit. The center of the table is filled with a circular design, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute logo multiplied as a continuous fret, which is done in tile and set in cast metal for permanence. The second piece is a very high bookcase, designed to hold volumes of the curriculum units and other Institute materials, with hand-plated inlay work across the top that carries the same continuous fret depicting the Institute logo. A banner continues the logo of the fret into the room. Most Centers contain at least one computer so the teachers have easy access to the Institute's Web site and other online resources.</p>
<p>Schools interested in becoming a Center site must submit an application that is approved by the principal and school planning and management team, who agree to support and provide necessary resources to the Center. In 2006, a group of Center leaders, including one teacher from each of the seven Center schools, met periodically to provide peer review of the Centers operations and to exchange ideas on effective Center activities. These meetings were held on January 25 at Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School, June 8 at Columbus Family Academy, October 11 at Davis Street School, November 15 at Fair Haven School (preceded by an open house for teachers at that school), and December 13 at Cooperative Arts and Humanities.</p>
<p>The meetings provided an opportunity to discuss reports from each Center and to orient teachers new to the Center concept. They explained connections between the hundreds of Institute-developed curriculum units and the academic standards and curricular priorities of the New Haven Public Schools and placed emphasis on ways the Centers can in support and engage beginning teachers.</p>

On November 8 the Center team in Wilbur Cross demonstrated Institute resources to colleagues there; this provided an occasion for past Fellows at the school to describe their Institute experiences. Earlier, on March 28, Wilbur Cross held an unveiling of a plaque recognizing all Fellows at the school. A similar event is planned for spring 2007 for Wilbur Cross, which continues to have a high level of teacher participation in Institute seminars. The Representative and other Center team members at the high school work together to increase their colleagues' awareness of the Institute's curricular resources and to encourage them to apply to become Fellows.
<p>Fair Haven School uses its Center as a "collaboration corner" to promote collegiality and introduce teachers to ways that Institute-developed units support school plans. The Center team has created an attractive, comfortable space in a high-traffic area with a copier, where posters call attention to teachers who have been Fellows. Cooperative Arts and Humanities High School has created a similar display in its Center, which is in a lounge area that many teachers frequent.</p>

<p>With respect to Centers' efforts to support beginning teachers, the Career High School Center's Coordinator wrote,</p>
<ul>The students have benefited from the Center's activities due to new teachers being able to access units that aid in providing a wealth of resources to beginning teachers who are not well endowed with resources or with the knowledge of where to look for such resources.

<tr><td width="85%">From June through August the Institute identified and approached the 56 teachers who would serve during the 2006-2007 school year as the 19 Representatives and 37 Contacts for their schools. (During 2005-2006, 85 teachers had served in these ways, 21 as Representatives and 64 as Contacts.) In 2006, the program's teacher leadership decided that returning to its earlier practice of having a smaller number of more closely involved teacher leaders made sense, a decision which substantially reduced the number of Contacts from the previous year. Representatives were selected according to recommendations of the teachers who served as seminar Coordinators and conversations they had with teachers who had served as Representatives in the past, with other Institute Fellows, and with some school principals. Because as a group the Coordinators had become acquainted with the Fellows in their seminars, they could consider all current Fellows for leadership positions, as they sought to ensure continuity while also including teachers who had not before served in these positions.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td width="85%">The number of Representatives and Contacts is proportionate to the number of schools at each level. As the number of K-8 schools within the district has grown, the number of Institute leaders from those schools has increased. During 2005-06, 46 (54 percent) of the Representatives and Contacts were from elementary or K-8 schools, eight (9 percent) represented middle schools, four (5 percent) represented transitional schools, and 27 (32 percent) represented high schools. In 2006-07, 34 (61 percent) were from elementary or K-8 schools, two (4 percent) represented middle schools (of which there were only two in fall 2006), three (5 percent) represented transitional schools, and 17 (30 percent) represented high schools. Every school had at least one Contact or Representative to serve as a conduit for information to and from the Institute throughout the school year. Of the Representatives and Contacts, about 20 percent were black non-Hispanic, 73 percent were white non-Hispanic, and 7 percent were Hispanic -- percentages that approximate the demographic composition of teachers in the district at large (See Table 1, page 26.) 
<p>Representatives meet twice monthly from September through December and weekly in January and February. They receive an honorarium for this work and agree in advance to participate in the program they are planning; Contacts perform many of the same functions but are not required to participate in meetings or to commit themselves to Institute participation. Through the Representatives and Contacts, the Institute ensures that all teachers throughout the school district may have an effective voice in shaping a program of curricular and staff development in which they will then have the opportunity to take part.</p>

<tr><td width="85%">The Representatives' first meeting for the new school year was on September 5. On September 26, a reception for Representatives and Contacts attracted numerous Contacts, including several who were new to their Institute responsibilities. Between meetings, the Representatives communicate by phone and through school visits with the Contacts for whom they serve as liaison to the committee of Representatives. In these ways, their meetings compile information from, and distribute information to, teachers throughout the New Haven schools. </td><td valign="top"></td></tr>

<tr><td width="85%">As Table 2 shows, 8 percent of current elementary grades teachers (in elementary, middle, and K-8 schools) in New Haven have completed successfully at least one year of the Institute. As Table 3 shows, 29 percent of New Haven high school teachers of subjects in the humanities and sciences, 29 percent of transitional school teachers, and 22 percent of middle grades teachers have also done so. The proportion of science teachers (28 percent) who have been Fellows is higher than in any other subject. A number of teachers have participated for two to fourteen years. Of the 204 Fellows still teaching in New Haven, about half (47 percent) have participated in the Institute once, 30 percent either two or three times, 18 percent four to six times, and 6 percent (14 individuals) between seven and fourteen times.</td><td valign="top">

<tr><td width="85%">Of the 24 New Haven Public Schools administrators who have participated as Institute Fellows, three fifths (63 percent) participated once or twice; six (25 percent) participated three to five times; and three participated seven, nine, or twenty-three times. Having former Fellows in positions ranging from Assistant Principal and Principal at the school level, to Associate Superintendent, Director of Instruction and Curriculum Supervisor at the district level, has made the Institute more visible, and has encouraged teachers to participate. In fall 2006, ten of the district's forty-five schools had former Institute Fellows as principals; an additional six schools had assistant principals who were former Fellows. Overall, more than one third of New Haven schools had former Institute Fellows in these administrative roles. One example is Wilbur Cross High School, an Institute Center school, whose principal and an assistant principal had been Fellows and which regularly has three-to-six teachers participating as Fellows.</td><td valign="top">

<tr><td width="85%">In 1996 members of the National Advisory Committee had suggested that the Institute engage in fuller documentation of its work beyond the seminars themselves, and of the wider effects of its program in the school system. They believed they were hearing from teachers and staff about many valuable results of the Institute's work that should be documented in forms that could be made more widely available. The Institute is therefore now documenting its various activities more extensively. This Annual Report itself is a massive compilation of information and statistics drawn from a variety of sources, including the questionnaires completed by Fellows and seminar leaders; reporting by school Representatives and Institute Center leaders; the tracking of all previous Fellows; statistics from the New Haven Public Schools, demographic analyses; minutes of meetings; project reports; reports from the Centers; reports to funders; and entries in the Institute's Web site guest book. The work that provides material for this Report extends over the entire year, and the Report is available online.</td>
