<td valign="top" width="85%">Electronic versions of the Institute's curriculum units and other publications are available at the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and Yale National Initiative Web (<a href="/">http://teachersinstitute.yale.edu</a> and <a href="http://teachers.yale.edu">http://teachers.yale.edu</a>, respectively). The New Haven Web site played an important role during the National Demonstration Project, as a link in its network of information and a model for the Web sites of other Teachers Institutes, and it remains essential as the Yale National Initiative proceeds. The full texts of almost all the curriculum units written in New Haven between 1978 and 2006, plus an <i>Index</i> and <i>Guide</i> to these units, are available online to teachers in New Haven and elsewhere. Information about the New Haven Institute (its brochures and most recent Annual Reports) is also available, as is the text of its periodical <i>On Common Ground</i>, which contains articles regarding school-university partnerships and is intended for a national audience. The Initiative also inaugurated in February 2004 a new Web site, which includes links to the New Haven Web site and to those of the other League Teachers Institutes. Many of the publications on the New Haven Web site, including PDF and HTML versions of the periodical, are available on the national Web site. That site also features extensive information on the Teachers Institute approach, the activity of the National Initiative, and news from the League of Teachers Institutes.</td><td valign="top"></td></tr>
<tr><td valign="top" width="85%">A "guest book" on both Web sites invites comments and suggestions. The national Web site also invites comments on specific curriculum units and provides other forms to solicit information from teachers, schools, colleges and universities interested in the Initiative. In recent years the New Haven site has been used by more and more people in many parts of this country and abroad -- teachers from both public and private schools (including Fellows from other Teachers Institutes in the National Demonstration Project and the Yale National Initiative), school and university administrators, parents, volunteers, university professors, high school students, graduate students, librarians, military personnel, home-schoolers, local policy-makers, and others conducting research or having an interest in education. We estimate that from its inauguration in June 1998 through December 2006, this Web site has been visited by nearly six million different persons. Of these, approximately 1,083,000 visited during 2006, when the site registered about 7.5 million hits.
<p>In 2006 we continued to hear from individuals in many countries. A partial list would include elementary and secondary school teachers, university professors, college students and researchers from Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Ethiopia, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Luxembourg, Nepal, Nigeria, the Philippines, Qatar, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The comments that these online visitors submitted were nearly all complimentary, and a reminder of one way that the Institute is participating in Yale's globalization.</p>

I was fortunate to get very good history/social studies instruction in high school, but not everyone does. Your project could help fix that!</ul>
