Numerous individuals and foundations have made gifts and grants to the Endowment Fund for the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. The 2006 Institute programs were supported in part also by grants from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and the Sherman Fairchild Foundation. The New Haven Public Schools, Yale's partner in the Institute, has supported the Institute's program in New Haven continuously since its inception.
