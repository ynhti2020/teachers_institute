<td width="85%"><p>During 2002, which marked its twenty-fifth anniversary, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute continued to make progress in its two complementary areas of activity: the local and the national.
</p><p>In New Haven it conducted a program of six seminars for Fellows. It continued its work with the Centers for Professional and Curricular Development in the schools (with eleven Centers in operation for most of this year). It developed further the relationship of its resources to school curricula, disseminating Reference Lists for High Schools and Elementary Schools that show the relationship of many Institute-developed curriculum units to school curricula and academic standards. It filled a new position of Associate Director, who now reinforces the Institute’s role in supporting New Haven’s efforts to recruit, develop and retain well-qualified teachers. It celebrated the Institute’s twenty-fifth anniversary through an event that attracted scores of former Fellows and seminar leaders—along with many members of the New Haven community and visitors from the Pittsburgh Teachers Institute and the Houston Teachers Institute—to a festive, affirming reunion. 
</p><p>Progress on the national level had been notably assisted, during the National Demonstration Project, by a four-year grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund (now the Wallace-Reader’s Digest Funds) and a supplementary three-year grant from the McCune Charitable Foundation. The Institute has now completed the three-year process of working with the four new Teachers Institutes that were then established—the Pittsburgh Teachers Institute, the Houston Teachers Institute, the Albuquerque Teachers Institute, and the UCI-Santa Ana Teachers Institute. The periodical sponsored by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, <i>On Common Ground</i>, summed up the National Demonstration Project in its special issue, Number 9.
</p><p>During 2002, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute continued to evaluate the results of the National Demonstration Project through collating and analyzing data from questionnaires and surveys. It also began the two-year Preparation Phase of the Yale National Initiative, assisted by an extension of the support for the National Demonstration Project by the Wallace-Reader’s Digest Funds into 2003 and a grant from the Jessie Ball duPont Fund for 2002-2003. It began to work with the Pittsburgh Teachers Institute and the Houston Teachers Institute, which received Research and Planning Grants during this Preparation Phase. And it continued its own preparation for the Implementation Phase of the Yale National Initiative.
</p><p>As the Institute completes twenty-five years of service in New Haven and five years of activity on the national scene, it looks forward to maintaining its local vigor and extending its national influence as an innovative model of professional development for teachers. The Institute is seeking funds to continue the Yale National Initiative through the remaining twelve-year Implementation Phase, which might establish as many as 45 new Teachers Institutes across the nation.
