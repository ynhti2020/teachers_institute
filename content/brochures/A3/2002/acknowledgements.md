<td width="85%"><p><i>The DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund and the National Endowment for the Humanities have provided the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute major grants in the form of both endowment and program support. The Fund made possible the Institute’s National Demonstration Project, which received support also from McCune Charitable Foundation. The 2002 Institute programs were supported in part by grants from the Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the Jessie Ball duPont Fund, and the Sherman Fairchild Foundation. In addition, a number of individuals and foundations, notably the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation, have made gifts and grants toward the Endowment Fund for the Teachers Institute. The New Haven Public Schools, Yale’s partner in the Institute, has supported the Institute’s program in New Haven continuously since its inception.</i>
