<td width="85%"><a name="a"></a><b>Aims, Scope, and Planning</b>
<p>The National Demonstration Project, supported by a four-year grant of
$2.5 million from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, aims to demonstrate
the feasibility of adaptations of the Institute approach at several other
sites. It directs its attention to sites where school systems serve a significant
number of students from low-income communities, but where the pattern and
magnitude of needs and resources are different from those that obtain in
New Haven, and where significant opportunities exist, without varying from
our approach, for devising local strategies in meeting those needs. From
March 1998 through January 1999, in accordance with its proposal to the
DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, the Teachers Institute had: 
</p><blockquote>• Invited fourteen sites to submit proposals for 8-month Planning
Grants 
<p>• Provided to those sites initial information concerning the Institute’s
policies and procedures 
</p><p>• Supervised the awarding of Planning Grants on recommendation of a
National Panel to five of the seven applicants 
</p><p>• Provided for the sites that received Planning Grants a “July Intensive”
that enabled a practical immersion in the processes of the Institute </p></blockquote>
<blockquote>• Awarded 3-year Implementation Grants, on recommendation of
a National Panel and on the advice of the program officer of the DeWitt
Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, and after further negotiations with certain
sites, to four applicants: Chatham College, Carnegie Mellon University,
and the Pittsburgh Public Schools; the University of Houston and the Houston
Independent School District; the University of New Mexico and the Albuquerque
Public Schools; and the University of California at Irvine and the Santa
Ana Unified School District 
<p>• And begun to work with the Grantees on their plans for the coming
years </p></blockquote>
The award to four applicants, instead of the three originally envisioned
in the proposal to the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, was made possible
in part by a supplementary grant of $150,000 by the McCune Charitable Foundation.
The National Panel concluded that all four sites had distinct advantages
as demonstration sites, though some concerns about budget and organizational
structure remained to be resolved. An array of four sites would give the
National Demonstration Project a greater diversity of institutional type,
urban scope, and organizational strategy. It would establish a larger base
for collaboration among the demonstration sites. In case of some insurmountable
difficulty at any one site, it would provide a firmer guarantee of three
demonstration sites reaching a successful conclusion. And if all four sites
were successful, it would provide an excellent coast-to-coast nucleus for
further expansion of the group of Teachers Institutes thereby established. 
<p>The four sites represent quite different urban challenges. All have
school systems considerably larger than that of New Haven, and all must
deal with serious problems associated with low-income communities and a
high proportion of racial and ethnic diversity. But they also illustrate
different institutional configurations and different strategies in approaching
those problems.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="b"></a><b>The Roles of the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute</b>
<p>For the duration of the Grant from the Fund, the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute will have a dual relationship to the four other Teachers Institutes.
It is both monitor of the Re-Grants to the four sites and a senior colleague
of those Institutes. It is responsible for offering technical assistance
to the other Teachers Institutes, for convening in 1999 the January Orientation
Session and the July Intensive Session, and for convening in 1999, 2000,
and 2001 the Annual Conferences in October. It also maintains the National
Steering Committee and the National University Advisory Council, sponsors
the national periodical On Common Ground, and helps in other ways to further
the aims of the entire league of Teachers Institutes and to disseminate
their accomplishments. It is responsible for conducting site visits each
year to offer assistance and to gain information about the progress of
each new Institute. At the same time, it encourages each of the other Teachers
Institutes to develop both a necessary independence and a collaborative
spirit. Its aim is to assist in transforming the group of five Teachers
Institutes into a fully collaborative league that might in the future extend
its membership to include Institutes at yet other sites. 
</p><p>This multiplicity of roles has required a continuing reassessment of
this Institute’s appropriate emphases. During the planning phase of the
Grant, we had been mainly providing information and experience that might
enable the demonstration sites to apprehend and internalize the basic principles
of this Institute. By the time of the January Orientation in 1999, it seemed
that the four demonstration sites had clearly begun to internalize those
principles and to discover their own collaborative relationships. During
the July Intensive Session, the plenary meetings were held about a pentagonal
table in order to signal the fundamental equality of the five collaborating
sites. We planned the First Annual Conference as an occasion for the demonstration
sites to step forward with their own best accomplishments and experiences,
while we stepped back somewhat to the position of observers. There have
now been calls for more equal participation of all five sites in the Second
Annual Conference, and we are continuing to work in that direction.</p></td>

</p><p>During 1999 the Implementation Team of Yale faculty members and New
Haven Teachers assisted with planning, carrying out, and assessing the
site visits to the four new Institutes. As was the case with regard to
the site visits in the Planning Phase of the Grant, a Protocol was established
to guide the members of the Implementation Team, and this Protocol was
discussed at a meeting of the team. (For members of the Implementation
Team, see Appendix.) Supplementary Protocols were also designed to highlight
the issues specific to each site that had been signaled by the National
Panel’s review and embodied in the contract, or had emerged in the course
of monitoring by Institute staff and members of the Implementation Team.
The visit to Albuquerque was made on September 23-24 by Thomas R. Whitaker,
Rogers M. Smith (Yale faculty member), and Mary E. Stewart (New Haven teacher).

<td width="85%"><a name="c"></a><b>The Common Work of the Five Teachers
Institutes</b>
<p><b>The January Orientation Session:</b> On January 8-9, 1999, an Orientation
Session was held in New Haven for teams from each site, including the director,
university faculty, and school teachers. The purpose of the session was
to hear directly the plans made by the sites for the Institutes they had
begun to create and to begin to provide as much practical assistance as
possible in the ongoing development of those plans. As Director Vivian
said, “In effect, we also inaugurate today a league of Teachers Institutes
stretching from coast to coast, united in a common purpose, and driven
by the concern we share for strengthening teaching and learning of the
humanities and the sciences in the nation’s urban public schools.” During
the Orientation Session the Directors spoke about the scope and strategy
their site had adopted and what their Institute intends to demonstrate.
A school teacher and a college or university faculty member from each site
spoke about the roles that teachers and faculty have played, and will be
playing. Caucuses of teachers and faculty members met with some of their
New Haven counterparts, while the Directors met with Vivian, Patricia Lydon,
and Thomas Whitaker. Meetings were also held to organize the National Steering
Committee and the National University Advisory Council.

<td width="85%">Planning was begun at this time for the second July Intensive
Session. It was decided that each site would determine what would be the
appropriate proportion of teachers who had participated in 1998 and teachers
new to the Institute process. Plans were made for participation in the
admissions process, which would take place much further in advance than
for the Intensive Session of July 1998, in order to make possible sufficient
advance reading by the participants. Proposals for National Seminars (determined
after urging the sites to canvas those teachers who seemed most likely
to take part in this year’s Intensive Session) were therefore presented
initially in this January Orientation Session, and seminar materials were
to be sent out at least two months in advance. Teachers at each site were
to make their choices of applicants by April 15. Members of the New Haven
Steering Committee would be joined by Steering Committee members from the
other sites in making the final allocations to the seminars. At least one
and no more than two teachers from each site would join each of the four
seminars. Proposals for National Seminars presented at this time were:
Mary E. Miller, “Art and Identity in Mexico, from the Olmec to Modern Times”;
Rogers M. Smith, “Immigration and American Life”; John P. Wargo, “Human-Environment
Relations”; and Thomas R. Whitaker, “Writing from Several Cultures.” 
<p>There was also a plenary session for discussion of technical assistance
to be provided by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. It focused on
the application and admissions process and the seminar and curriculum unit
writing process of the Institute. These topics continued to require explanation
in the course of this year, in large part because the National Demonstration
Project is very different from the professional development or outreach
programs to which faculty and teachers have become accustomed. 
</p><p>In another session the entire group discussed the documentation and
evaluation of our work together over the next three years and the nature
of the Fund-commissioned evaluation to be proceeding concurrently. After
a review of the expectations and procedures for the internal evaluation,
which includes reporting by each site as specified in the Request for Proposals
and in their contracts, Ed Pauly and Ian Beckford from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund set forth the purposes of the external evaluation, its intended
cooperation with the self-studies and reports from the sites, and its desired
national impact. Ian Beckford then elicited from the group informal statements
of what they hoped to accomplish in the coming three years at each site.
The Directors of each Institute also met individually with Director Vivian,
Patricia Lydon, and Thomas Whitaker, to discuss the comments made during
and after the review by the National Panel and any continuing problems
at each site. 
</p><p>A concluding roundtable discussion elicited very favorable comments
on this January Orientation and appreciation of the fact that there was
now evident an actual face-to-face community of Institutes, working toward
the improvement of education in this nation.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><b>The Faculty Forum: </b>In May 1999, as a result of discussions
in the National University Advisory Council, the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute established a moderated electronic forum for the exchange of
views and information by college and university faculty members involved
in the National Demonstration Project. The Teachers Institute Faculty Forum
(TIFF) may be addressed at tiff@yale.edu. The moderator is Professor Jules
D. Prown of Yale University. During the late spring, TIFF handled a number
of messages from faculty members at the new Teachers Institutes who sought
advice about procedures for leading a seminar and supervising curriculum
units. Because very little traffic developed, however, the continuance
of TIFF became a topic for faculty discussion during the July Intensive
Session and the First Annual Conference.

</p><p>In response to a suggestion made during the Annual Conference, a meeting
was held on December 13 of a diverse group of past Institute seminar leaders
in New Haven. They discussed what would be, in the light of their practical
experience, the most useful issues, framed with questions and some individual
solutions, that might be posted electronically in the hope of stimulating
further discussion on TIFF. The seminar leaders suggested a dozen or so
categories of issues that ran a gamut from vetting seminar applications,
dealing with the apparently unprepared Fellow, and the seminar leaders’
work with Coordinators, through problems of seminar practice, collegiality,
breaking out of the lecture format, use of the Internet, use of the library,
visiting classrooms, and the writing of curriculum units, on to ways of
dealing with curriculum units that threaten to be unsatisfactory. It was
agreed that Jules Prown would organize a list, putting it in the sequence
in which such issues might arise in the course of a site’s work. The list
would then be posted in installments at appropriate times in the course
of the coming year. We would hope eventually to prepare a list of frequently
asked questions for a password-protected area of our Web site.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><b>The Second July Intensive Session: </b>On March 2, Director
Vivian wrote to provide the sites with additional information on the plans
for the Intensive Session to be held on July 6-14 and to request their
further suggestions. Each site team would include six teachers from the
target schools who are current participants in the site’s own seminars
(at least one or two of whom should have attended both the 1998 Intensive
Session and the 1999 January Orientation). Each team would also include
three current or future seminar leaders who are key faculty participants
in the site’s work. As in July 1998, the program for the teachers would
include seminars and curriculum-unit development, but there would be no
written work for faculty members or directors. There would be ancillary
meetings for site representatives to compare their experiences in organizing
and conducting a Teachers Institute. Other sessions—devoted to fund raising,
financial management, university-school relations, and other topics—would
be arranged according to the requests of participants. 
<p>Each teacher would therefore participate in a National Seminar, attend
a workshop on writing a curriculum unit, observe two local seminars, and
meet with New Haven teachers, members of the Yale-New Haven Implementation
Team, and staff of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. Each new Teachers
Institute would designate one of its teachers to be a Coordinator in a
National Seminar; each Coordinator would also meet with other Coordinators,
with James Vivian, New Haven Coordinators, and the Directors of the four
new Teachers Institutes. The faculty members would each observe three National
Seminars and a local seminar, attend the workshop on writing curriculum
units, and meet with each other and with the National Seminar Leaders,
Yale faculty members, and staff of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.
It was decided, in consultation with the faculty members, that they would
not remain through the last three days of the Session. Each Director would
observe two local seminars, attend the workshops on writing a curriculum
unit, observe Coordinators’ meetings, and meet with James Vivian, members
of the Yale-New Haven Implementation Team, and staff of the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute. There would be talks by the four national seminar leaders,
periodic team meetings, a meeting of the National Steering Committee, and
a meeting of the National University Advisory Council. 
</p><p>In mid-April, the members of the National Steering Committee worked
with the New Haven Steering Committee to review the applications of the
teachers who would participate in the national seminars. Each of the four
members of our Steering Committee worked with a member of the National
Steering Committee, working first site by site and then seminar by seminar
(as if they were Coordinators conducting a review of the applications).
Then, as in 1998, these members of the New Haven Steering Committee made
calls to the teachers who had been admitted into the national seminars.
After this review, the Leaders of the national seminars wrote the Fellows
who had been admitted to provide them with suggested readings and schedules
for the seminars. Vivian also wrote each visiting Fellow to provide information
on the seminar process, the writing of curriculum units, and the library
and computer facilities being made available. 
</p><p>At the outset of the Intensive Session, the Directors of the four new
Teachers Institutes offered summaries of the accomplishments and the continuing
issues at each site, and the leaders of the national seminars were introduced.
In meetings with faculty members, teachers, and Directors, the main problems
anticipated or being encountered by those groups were considered. The National
University Advisory Council discussed the present status of TIFF. Faculty
members discussed how the compressed schedules in certain sites were working,
and how to deal with curriculum units that appeared unsatisfactory. Many
of them found their observation of the “collegiality” in both the national
seminars and the local seminars to be helpful in clarifying the Institute
approach. The teachers made clear that they would like a firmer role in
the Annual Conference in October, and that they needed to understand more
fully the roles of Representatives and Coordinators.

<td width="85%">Patricia Lydon continued her work with the Directors on
grant management, budgets, and financial reports. James Vivian met with
the Directors both individually and as a group on a variety of administrative
issues and began to plan site visits. He, Patricia Lydon, and Thomas Whitaker
met with each site team individually to hear comments on the current accomplishments
and challenges, and offer suggestions if asked to do so. At the end of
this Intensive Session, the Directors gave summary reports on their deliberations
during the Session, their present concerns, and their plans for the coming
year. 
<p>At this plenary meeting, several decisions about the First Annual Conference
were also made. Each site would select one delegate to a planning committee
for the conference; those four persons would consult widely with others
at their sites, confer with each other, and provide James Vivian with recommendations.
(The members of the planning committee, as later selected, were: Verna
Arnold, Pittsburgh; Ninfa A. Sepulveda, Houston; Doug Earick, Albuquerque;
and Heidi R. Cooley, Santa Ana.) Vivian would then circulate those recommendations
to the National Steering Committee, the National University Advisory Council,
and the Directors of the four Institutes for comments. It was Vivian’s
view, shared by most others present, that the conference should address
the exemplary practices and plans of the sites, as well as “whatever issues
have arisen locally in our common work.” 
</p><p>The visiting Fellows in the national seminars were generally enthusiastic
about their seminars, and they clearly appreciated the advance planning
for them and the opportunity to think about the reading and their curriculum
units before arriving in New Haven. There was, therefore, much less anxiety
about completing the work than there had been in July 1998. As was evident
in the responses to the Teachers Institute’s questionnaires, there was
much greater satisfaction with housing conditions and the availability
of library, computer, and printing resources. The Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute had been able to arrange substantial improvements in all these
areas. Those participating especially appreciated the presence now of the
computer assistant who devoted much time to working with those who were
preparing drafts of curriculum units. Teachers described their experience
as “highly informative,” “stimulating,” “fantastic.” They expressed “gratitude
for the very friendly atmosphere” of the seminars. And they commented on
their gain of understanding of the process of writing a curriculum unit,
and on how those units, though reaching only the first-draft stage here,
would contribute to their classroom teaching. A number of teachers hoped
that the summer component in the National Demonstration Project could continue,
perhaps in some different format or at different sites. 
</p><p>The four Yale faculty members who served as leaders of the national
seminars thought them generally to be successful. One seminar leader, who
found the national seminar less satisfactory than a local seminar in New
Haven, said that the absence of elementary teachers was a disadvantage.
In the New Haven seminar “we learned the most, both in substance and pedagogic
style, from the art teachers, the music teacher, and the elementary teachers.
Their adaptations were simply more imaginative.” This seminar leader also
said, “although I thought most Fellows performed remarkably, I also thought
we just did not have enough time to come up to speed regarding the subject
before turning to the lesson plans.”</p></td>

<td width="85%">Another seminar leader said, however, that 
<blockquote>from the prospectus to the first draft, every unit grew extensively
in length and became far more clearly conceived, fully worked out, and
more richly detailed and documented. I was amazed they all did so much
in such a short and busy period. Overall, it is extremely satisfying to
work with such motivated people who bring such a range of pertinent experiences,
knowledge, and insights to discussions. </blockquote>

</p><p>This seminar leader concluded: 
</p><blockquote>I found the experience of offering national seminars the last
two years so satisfying, and the response from teachers so positive, that
I believe we should begin exploring how the widespread desire to repeat
this experience in the future can be met. </blockquote>
Collegiality within and across the sites was an important feature of this
July Intensive. A teacher expressed appreciation for being able to work
with another teacher from her team, learning how to share lessons. A faculty
member, while finding the sharing of experience about writing curriculum
units to be “invaluable,” also confessed to being “as interested, if not
more, in the experiences, procedures, and practices” at the other sites
as he was in those in New Haven. A Director noted that conversation with
Coordinators from New Haven and the other sites “was useful, giving us
grounds for comparing our Fellows’ problems with those of others and offering
some concrete ways of addressing issues.” This Director also noted that
conversations with Directors from other sites “helped me to understand
which challenges we have in common and which are unique to a site. We shared
ideas for solving problems, heading off problems, and creating opportunities
for our respective Institutes.” 
<p>Questions remained in the minds of some teachers, faculty members, and
Directors: about teacher leadership, seminar planning, curriculum-unit
writing, the role of Coordinators, and indeed the sixteen Basic Principles
that are part of each contract and that are now printed as an appendix
to the Brochure for the project. In a meeting of the Implementation Team
in New Haven on July 16, these issues and others were discussed as bases
for shaping the site visits (which have been described above) and the First
Annual Conference. Nonetheless, the overall impression of the Implementation
Team was that, as one put it, “we now have in each of the sites a core
of teachers and faculty and some administrators that seem knowledgeable
and excited about the Project.” It was hoped that the Annual Conference
might move yet further in providing mutual education among the new Institutes
themselves, and a yet fuller demonstration of collaboration within and
across the sites.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><b>The First Annual Conference:</b> The First Annual Conference
was held in New Haven on October 22-23. Its main purpose was to feature
the accomplishments of the four new Institutes. There were panels and roundtable
discussions on “The 1999 Seminars and Curriculum Units,” “Disseminating
Curriculum Units and Promoting Institutes Locally,” “Teacher Leadership
in the Institutes and in Schools,” and on the second day, a panel discussion
on “Results for Students.” The first two panels offered clear indications
of the work being done in certain seminars and of the vigorous attempts
by some teachers and Directors to promote their Institutes. Some participants
felt that the panel on “Teacher Leadership” needed to go yet further to
engage with specificity the problems and achievements in establishing groups
of Teacher Representatives. The panel on “Results for Students,” a topic
of great interest, dealt very largely with procedures that are explicitly
excluded from the present Grant. There was some vigorous argument about
methods of assessing student results, and a general opposition to the insistence
upon standardized tests and a preference for evaluations that may test
the ability to think and write creatively.

<td width="85%">The concluding portion of the program dealt with “The External
Evaluation of the National Demonstration Project.” Ian Beckford and Bruce
Haslam presented the plans for the evaluation as intended by Policy Studies
Associates, which has been commissioned by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund to carry out this task. In doing so, Haslam noted that he had
been struck during the conference by the amount of institutional learning
that is already occurring. He emphasized that the Interim Reports in 2000
and 2001 would not evaluate individual projects or summarize progress on
a site by site basis. The Final Report in 2002 would include specific case
studies only as appendices. During the following discussion, some questions
were raised by teachers and faculty members about whether the evaluation
would sufficiently focus upon the Demonstration Project’s collaborative
dimensions and its intent to assist and energize teachers in ways that
go well beyond the standards that are prescribed by district mandates. 
<p>A meeting of the National Steering Committee brought forth many suggestions,
most importantly that a newsletter be established for the National Demonstration
Project. Thus far we have received contributions for the newsletter from
two of the new Institutes. The final afternoon was kept open for individual
meetings with Directors or site teams and persons from Policy Studies Associates. 
</p><p>It was clearer yet from the Annual Conference that the teams from the
four new Institutes are in the process of working out genuine collaboration
in many ways, through formal and informal meetings and other communications.
They seemed to welcome the shift of emphasis on this occasion, as the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute retired somewhat in the background as observers,
and delegates from the new sites had the opportunity for more direct sharing.
They looked forward to a Second Annual Conference in 2000, and several
team-members also expressed the hope that the national seminars in the
July Intensive Session might also be continued in some fashion. 
</p><p>Of the Conference as a whole, one Director said: “I found all the panel
discussions involving members from the demonstration sites to be very useful.
This has generally been the case any time the sites have been brought together
to share information and experiences, and I would welcome the opportunity
to do this more frequently.” There were a few expressions of disappointment.
A Director commented on the panel on “Teacher Leadership”: “Presentations
drifted into testimonial too quickly for my taste. We know teacher leadership
is a good thing. The questions are: How do we develop it? What are the
impediments?” In general, however, those attending the Conference found
it a success. One teacher said: 
</p><blockquote>The overview of the seminars and the examples of the curricular
units from different sites was inspiring. It was reassuring to see that
all of the sites seem to face similar challenges. The format of having
a panel discussion after each site’s separate presentation was particularly
helpful. There was always a lively and open exchange of ideas and comments. </blockquote>
Another teacher said: “Your conference was a total class act. I gained
knowledge, insight, renewal, and a sense of hope for my profession.” A
faculty member said: “Each meeting with Yale faculty and other faculty
has helped immeasurably, particularly with the ‘nuts and bolts’ of the
process of a seminar.” 
<p>Another faculty member, new to the Demonstration Project, wrote at length
in praise of “the organization of the conference as a fully teacher-centered
enterprise.” He said: 
</p><blockquote>The two days were driven by a genuine interest in dialogue
that cuts across all potential lines of division (geographical, institutional,
professional, disciplinary). The question-and-answer periods were among
the liveliest and most respectful I have encountered. I enjoyed the “creative
tensions” that arise in a national project that must (and does) juggle
an overall vision or organization along with the particularities of local
sites. At no point were problems ever considered insurmountable; and at
no point were the differences among sites . . . swept under the rug. .
. . Perhaps all these positive experiences can be summed up in the commitment
that I saw demonstrated at the conference to maintaining and working through
ambivalences arising from often opposing goals rather than dropping one
side or the other for the sake of expediency. </blockquote>
Several participants expressed the hope that next year’s Annual Conference
might take place at one of the other sites, and that the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute would now take a more obviously active part. One faculty
member said: “I’d like to see the Yale participants be more fully integrated.
I understand and appreciate holding them back for the Year 1 Conference,
but for Year 2 they can bring some sense of history and commonality to
the proceedings.” Because the purpose of this Conference was to feature
the demonstration sites, we did not participate directly in any of the
panels. It may be appropriate, however, for us to plan to engage more fully
and visibly in the future Conferences.</td>

<td width="85%"><a name="B"></a><b>The Work of the Four New Teachers Institutes</b>
<p>Throughout the year the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has been working
with the four new Institutes in a variety of ways. Patricia Lydon, Liaison
to the sites, has been frequently monitoring and advising on budgetary
and organizational matters by telephone, e-mail, correspondence, and direct
conversations in meetings. Director Vivian has been responsive to many
questions and difficulties of a more wide-ranging character that have been
raised by the sites. Contacts have been established between teachers and
faculty members on the Implementation Team with their counterparts at various
sites. Site visits have provided first-hand information from a variety
of people, university and school administrators as well as teachers and
faculty members. And the annual narrative and financial reports submitted
by four new Institutes have set forth their challenges and accomplishments
during this first year of implementing the National Demonstration Project.
In its second Annual Report to the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund,
the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has described its monitoring and
technical assistance in considerable detail. Here we offer a condensed
account of the experiences of the new Institutes. 
</p><p><a name="Ba"></a><b>Pittsburgh Teachers Institute:</b> This Institute
brings the resources of Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon University
to a selected portion of a school district with 93 schools serving 41,000
students. Both institutions have previously worked with the schools, but
this is the first occasion when the two institutions have collaborated
on a project in partnership with the schools. The Pittsburgh Teachers Institute
works with 20 elementary, middle, and high schools, representing the three
regions of the district, which have volunteered to take part. Helen Faison,
an experienced teacher and school administrator within the Pittsburgh Public
Schools and former chair of the Education Department at Chatham College,
serves as Director. Her work has clearly earned her the esteem of the teachers
union and major funders in the Pittsburgh area. She is well suited to be
at the center of a complex community endeavor. Barbara Lazarus, Vice-Provost
at Carnegie Mellon, and Anne Steele, Vice-President at Chatham, assist
Faison in matters relating to those two institutions.</p></td>

<td width="85%">On June 29, President Esther L. Barazzone of Chatham College
and President Jared L. Cohon of Carnegie Mellon University requested that
Helen Faison be relieved of the directorship until June 2000 in order to
assume the position of interim-Superintendent of Schools in Pittsburgh.
They recommended that during her absence John Groch, Assistant Professor
of Communications at Chatham College, serve as Acting Director. Director
Vivian approved this appointment, with the understanding that Groch would
be relieved of all other duties for the period of time when he is Acting
Institute Director. Presidents Jared Cohon and Esther Barazzone have also
indicated their willingness to constitute a University Advisory Council
that includes senior faculty from both campuses. In New Haven we have found
such a University Advisory Council, which can assist with advocacy, continuity,
and development, an essential piece in involving senior faculty and recruiting
faculty to become leaders.

</p><p>In 1999 the Pittsburgh Teachers Institute offered four seminars for
32 teachers (26 of whom completed curriculum units): “Newspapers: Yesterday,
Today, and Tomorrow” (James Davidson, Adjunct Professor of English, Carnegie
Mellon University); “American Culture in the 1950s” (John Groch, Assistant
Professor of Communication, Chatham College); “Physics, Energy, and Environmental

and “Multicultural Literature: French African and Creole Writers” (Janet
Walker, Professor of French and Chair, Department of Modern Languages,
Chatham College). The curriculum units have been printed, distributed,
and made available on the Institute’s Web site. 
</p><p>School Representatives from the 12 largest schools served by the Pittsburgh
Teachers Institute had been convened as an Implementation Committee to
supervise the planning of seminars and the applications process. A Fellow
from each seminar was selected to serve as a coordinator, responsible,
along with the Institute’s Director, for reviewing the curriculum unit
to ensure its adherence to the academic standards and core curriculum of
the Pittsburgh Public Schools. At each step of the process, units were
submitted to seminar coordinators, who reviewed them to be sure that they
specifically addressed at least some of the School District’s 62 standards
for Communication, World Languages, Family and Consumer Sciences, Mathematics,
and/or Arts and Humanities. 
</p><p>For 2000, seven seminars are planned: “Pittsburgh Writers,” James Davidson
(English, Carnegie Mellon University); “Interdisciplinary Approaches to
Pittsburgh History” (Steffi Domike, Art, Chatham College); “From Eureka
to Newton’s Apple: Scientific though from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance”
(John Hagen, Chemistry, Chatham College); “Learning Physics through Science
Fiction” (Richard Holman, Physics, Carnegie Mellon University); “American
History through Art” (Elisabeth Roark, Art, Chatham College); “Proof in
Mathematics: Origin, Practice, Crisis” (Juan Jorge Schäffer, Mathematical
Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University); and “Religion in American Society”
(Janet Stocks, History, Carnegie Mellon University). The Institute’s seminar
schedule is closely modeled on that in New Haven.</p></td>

<p><a name="Bb"></a><b>Houston Teachers Institute:</b> In the fourth largest
city in the United States, the Houston Teachers Institute brings the resources
of the University of Houston to the Houston Independent School District,
where 280 schools serve 212,000 students. The University is a state-supported
research and teaching institution that draws most of its students from
the Greater Houston area. The Institute works with 20 self-selected middle
and high schools enrolling 31,300 students to establish a program that
will address the needs of an ethnically mixed student-body, a large proportion
of whom are non-English speaking. Paul Cooke, who has been a Visiting Assistant
Professor of Political Science, serves as Director. He has tried to model
the Houston program very closely on that in New Haven and has sought frequent
contact and assistance from the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. 
</p><p>In 1999 the Institute offered six seminars for 75 teachers (60 of whom
completed curriculum units): “Symmetry, Patterns, and Designs” (Michael
Field, Professor of Mathematics); “Hollywood Distortions of History” (Garth
Jowett, Professor of Communication); “The United States in the 1960s” (Lawrence
Curry, Assistant Professor of History and Associate Dean); “Technology
and the Discipline of Chemistry” (Simon G. Bott, Research Associate Professor
of Chemistry); “The History, Economic Base, and Politics of Houston” (Richard
Murray, Professor of Political Science); and “Addressing Evil” (Cynthia
A. Freeland, Professor of Philosophy). 
</p><p>The Houston Teachers Institute now has a vigorous group of teacher leaders.
Its Teacher Representatives have been meeting regularly to carry forward
the work of the Institute. The week-to-week business of the seminar program
has been monitored by the Coordinators Committee. 
</p><p>President Arthur Smith has also expressed interest in naming faculty
members to an Advisory Council for the Institute. And from the very beginning
the Institute has benefited from the enthusiastic support of Susan Sclafani,
Chief of Staff for Academic Operations at the Houston Independent School
District. 
</p><p>In the short term, however, the financial situation has been unexpectedly
difficult. Still, very encouragingly, at Sclafani’s request, HISD provided
$50,000 to help meet the budget for 1999. And an application made to the
Houston Endowment, to be applied to commitments made by both HISD and the
University of Houston, resulted on January 18, 2000, in a grant of $150,000.

<td width="85%"><a name="Bc"></a><b>Albuquerque Teachers Institute:</b>
Located in a state that ranks near the bottom of the nation on many economic
and educational indices, including per capita expenditures on students
and on teachers’ salaries, and in a school district that has serious morale
problems among teachers and a high attrition rate among students, the Albuquerque
Teachers Institute has thus far been able to meet its considerable challenges.
It brings the resources of the College of Arts and Sciences at the University
of New Mexico, the flagship state institution of higher education, to a
selected portion of a district that serves 85,800 students in 121 schools
and enrolls a high percentage of Hispanic students from low-income families.
This Institute has selected 21 middle and high schools where the problem
of attrition is most serious. It has also sought to establish the relevance
and interest of its program for both teachers and students by focusing
on topics that link the Southwest and contemporary issues. In 1999, it
offered four seminars for 36 teachers (35 of whom completed a curriculum
unit): “Archaeoastronomy” (Michael Zeilik, Professor of Astronomy); “Environmental
Impacts of Human Settlement and Urbanization on the Albuquerque Region”
(Leslie D. McFadden, Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences); “Architecture
in the Southwest” (Anne Taylor, Professor of Architecture); and “Political
Culture in New Mexico” (Phillip B. Gonzales, Associate Professor of Sociology). 
<p>This Institute is testing the workability of a Co-Directorship. Laura
Cameron, who had been director of Freshman Mathematics and Planning Director
for the project, was able to serve as Co-Director only for the first seven
months of 1999. The other Co-Director, Wanda Martin, Associate Professor
of English, who had been director of Freshman English, could serve for
a longer period. After consultation with teachers and faculty, as well
as with the Director of APS Strategic Professional Development, it was
proposed by Wanda Martin and Michael Fischer, Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences, that Cameron be succeeded by Doug Earick, a senior teacher
at Albuquerque High School, and a leader in the Institute planning process.
Earick’s appointment must be renewed (as must all the district’s budgetary
support) on an annual basis.</p></td>

</p><p>Co-Director Earick has very good contacts with teachers, is recruiting
vigorously, and is being helped by enthusiastic Fellows. A detailed schedule
was established for meetings of Teacher Representatives to determine seminars
and invite applications. The handbook for Teacher Representatives is a
model that might well be imitated by other Institutes, and there is an
excellent brochure for general distribution. Although Representatives have
not yet been established in all 21 schools being served, the Co-Directors
have recruited Representatives from nine schools not represented in the
1999 seminars. 
</p><p>The 1999 curriculum units have been published and are on the Institute’s
Web site. There are links that also take one to the Web sites to which
the teachers refer in their bibliographies. The plans for next year include
some seminars that have no specific emphasis on the Southwest. The seminar
schedule is also being revised, on the recommendation of both Fellows and
seminar leaders, to extend the intensive period to four weeks, and to distribute
materials in advance. 
</p><p>Six seminars are planned for 2000: “Weighing Environmental Risks: Uncertainties
and Variables” (Professor David S. Gutzler, Department of Earth and Planetary
Science); “The Indo-Hispano Cultural Legacy of New Mexico” (Professor Enrique
Lamadrid, Department of Spanish and Portuguese); “Human Decision-Making:
Rational and Irrational” (Professor Kate Krause, Department of Economics);
“The United States of America: The Ideal and the Reality” (Professor Fred
Harris, Department of Political Science); “Atomic America: Technology,
Representation, and Culture in the 20th Century” (Professor Timothy Moy,
Department of History); and “Literature and the Environment” (Professor
Gary Harrison, Department of English). 
</p><p>The Albuquerque Teachers Institute is working to develop sustainable
funding. President Gordon approved a special legislative request that would
jointly fund professional development projects in the Colleges of Education
and Arts &amp; Sciences. The COE project would train university faculty
in using instructional technology, and A&amp;S would contribute to teacher
quality in the schools by providing Teachers Institute seminars in the
humanities, sciences, and social sciences. 
</p><p>This request is extraordinary in its significance, for it gives equal
importance to the funding of the Albuquerque Teachers Institute and the
funding of the School of Education’s proposal. Although the bill embodying
this request was given first priority by the Commission on Higher Education,
it did not obtain final legislative approval in 1999 because of the Governor’s
opposition to any education bill that did not provide for school vouchers.
The proposal was renewed for 2000. It is now explicitly coupled with the
expectation that state funding would require the Teachers Institute to
expand in some fashion on a state-wide basis. President Gordon has said,
however, that the University will financially support the Institute even
without the State aid that has been requested.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="d"></a><b>National Accomplishments</b>
<p>The Annual Report for 1998 gave a complete account of the distinctive
pattern of needs and resources at each of the four new Teachers Institutes.
Each is at a somewhat different stage of development; and each in certain
ways may serve as a model for the establishment of Teachers Institutes
elsewhere in the United States. The Institutes will also illustrate different
patterns of relationship to state mandates, local resources, and institutional
apparatus—and the state-funded universities will be especially interesting
in this regard. Each site has also gone through a distinctive process in
arranging for a director. 
</p><p>We have noted in this Annual Report some of the major challenges and
accomplishments at each of the four new Teachers Institutes. Here we summarize
briefly the most important accomplishments of the National Demonstration
Project as a whole and note some of their implications. 
</p><p>The Project has already demonstrated in four different cities larger
than New Haven: 
</p><blockquote>• That a Teachers Institute serving approximately 20 schools
can be rapidly inaugurated 
<p>• That such a Teachers Institute can immediately carry out a program
of 4-6 content-based seminars in the humanities and sciences, which increase
teachers’ knowledge, heighten their morale, and result in individually
crafted curriculum units of substance for use in classrooms 
</p><p>• That such Institutes will arouse the enthusiasm and support of significant
numbers of teachers and university faculty members 
</p><p>• That such Institutes can attract support—including pledges of continuing
support—from administrators of a private liberal arts college, a private
university emphasizing the sciences, a flagship state university, and a
major state university in a larger system 
</p><p>• And that high-level administrators in school districts, superintendents
or their immediate subordinates, will be attracted by the idea of such
an Institute, will start thinking about the local means of scaling-up,
and will commit themselves to its long-term support </p></blockquote>

<td width="85%">With regard to the prospects for continuity and sustainability
beyond the terms of the Grant, the signs are optimistic indeed. At all
four sites, many teachers who have been Fellows are becoming enthusiastic
recruiters of new Fellows. At all four sites, faculty members are learning
the importance of Institute procedures and with administrative help are
forming Faculty Advisory Councils. At all four sites, top-level administrators
in institutions of higher education have pledged to assist in the seeking
of funds. At two sites (Albuquerque and Irvine-Santa Ana) they have pledged
university financial support in addition. At all four sites, school districts
have made a significant financial commitment. And at two sites (Pittsburgh
and Houston), school administrators are providing significant help in the
seeking of additional funds. 
<p>At the outset, we had not known how each site would meet the very stiff
requirements of cost-sharing for this Grant. This has been accomplished
significantly through the help of district funds but in a variety of ways.
At UCI-Santa Ana the University is the major contributor; at Albuquerque
the contributions of University and district are roughly equal; at Houston
the district has been of primary assistance; and at Pittsburgh outside
funding has been of greatest importance.</p></td>

<td width="85%">It is also important that all four of the Teachers Institutes
are paying close attention, in different ways, to the mandates, standards,
and interests of local school districts and state educational systems.
Fellows have discussed the ways in which such standards may be tacitly
or explicitly incorporated into the curriculum units. In Pittsburgh, Houston,
and Albuquerque some seminars have emphasized local history, literature,
geography, architecture, ecology, and economics. And in Pittsburgh there
has been a special effort to make certain that both seminars and curriculum
units are in accord with the district academic standards. 
<p>The prospects for longer-term scaling-up also look very good at this
point. The Teachers Institutes at the four demonstration sites already
point toward different means through which this might be accomplished.
Al Mijares, Superintendent of the Santa Ana Unified School District, wrote
on November 11, 1999, “I hope eventually that all of our teachers and students
will benefit from teacher participation in the Institute.” Susan Sclafani,
Chief of Staff for Academic Operations at the Houston Independent School
District, has stated that HISD is committed to establishing the Institute
beyond the three-year implementation period, and she has offered to form
a committee for long-range planning. She is also interested in the possibility
of using some of the District funds for professional development that are
appropriated to each school as a means to assist the Institute. In Pittsburgh,
two institutions of higher education have established a consortium that
can serve as a model for expansion elsewhere. And in Albuquerque and Irvine-Santa
Ana, top-level administrators are thinking about the possibility of expansion
not just within one city but also elsewhere in the state. 
</p><p>A joint statement by President Esther L. Barazzone of Chatham College
and President Jared L. Cohon of Carnegie Mellon University and a statement
by Executive Vice Chancellor Lillyman of the University of California at
Irvine will serve to illustrate the administrative support that is crucial
to such scaling-up—at these institutions and others throughout the nation.</p></td>

<td width="85%">In the course of contract negotiations, Presidents Barazzone
and Cohon wrote on March 2, 1999, as follows: 
<blockquote>On behalf of Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon University,
we would like to reiterate our intent to function as a consortium in all
aspects of the creation and sustenance of our Pittsburgh Teachers Institute.
As proof of our commitment to this consortium, we have pledged to seek
outside funding for the Pittsburgh Teachers Institute as a team. We have,
respectively, charged our development personnel to work with Dr. Helen
Faison and Mr. Phil Parr (Director of Planning and Strategic Development
at the Pittsburgh Public Schools) in targeting foundation suppport for
this project. Thus, we envision that neither Carnegie Mellon University
nor Chatham College will have sole responsibility for raising matching
funds. To the contrary, both institutions will have collective responsibility
for raising these funds. The funds that our consortium raises and the funds
that we receive from Yale University we hope to place in a unified Pittsburgh
Teachers Institute account. . . . We believe that this accounting model
reflects our true commitment to function as a consortium, not three separate
entities. </blockquote>
In forwarding the Annual Report from the Irvine-Santa Ana Teachers Institute,
Executive Vice Chancellor Lillyman wrote: 
<blockquote>The goals and practices of the UCI-Santa Ana Teachers Institute
are in keeping with the University of California and UCI’s outreach mission,
to expand educational opportunities for all Californians. Creating innovative
opportunities for professional development is a key strategy in our efforts
towards this goal. When teachers are inspired to take responsibility for
the knowledge process through active engagement in reading, writing, and
research, they can have a strong effect on the intellectual lives and futures
of their students. </blockquote>
<blockquote>The chance to participate in a national dialogue on educational
content and policy is an added benefit of this project, which combines
serious and concerted focus on local problems with sustained reflection
and interchange among sites across the nation. </blockquote>
This “interchange among sites across the nation” is a major objective of
the National Demonstration Project. In fact, as the increasing collaboration
evident in the Annual Conference, the establishment of Web sites, and the
proposals for future Annual Conferences, additional national seminars,
and a newsletter have indicated, this is also a swiftly developing area
of national accomplishment. A substantial momentum now impels the Institutes
at all five sites to work more closely with each other. And that accomplishment
points toward the potential expansion of this effort in the future to include
Institutes at yet other sites.</td>

<td width="85%"><a name="e"></a><b>Learning in New Haven</b>
<p>In the Annual Report for 1998 we noted under this heading that the staff
and the Implementation Team had become increasingly convinced that there
is no substitute for direct observation and participation in the process
of getting acquainted with the principles and practices of the Teachers
Institute. We also noted that New Haven teachers and Yale University faculty
members are learning as individuals, gaining among other things a heightened
sense of being part of a national community of concerned educators. This
year the July Intensive Session and, especially, the Annual Conference
gave us as a group and as individuals a much clearer sense of participating
in a collaborative endeavor.

</p><p>We have also been watching carefully the organizational arrangements
and the funding initiatives at each site for any clues they may provide
that will be of benefit to our own operation. Certain seminars offered
at the four sites may also alert us to topics that have been insufficiently
explored by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. 
</p><p>We also noted in the Annual Report for 1998 that some learning in New
Haven is of provisional usefulness: it will depend upon whether we are
able to proceed in the future with a second phase of the National Demonstration
Project. If so, we said, there are a number of revisions in the Request
for Proposals that should be made and the “Basic Commitments,” now called
“Principles,” should also be strengthened and clarified. Our work with
several sites this year concerning participant-leadership among the teachers
and the responsibilities and functions of the Director of an Institute,
and our continuing concerns about the “long-term” nature of the seminars,
have further heightened our sense that these revisions would be needed.
Our review of the “Basic Principles” in the light of this experience, and
our assessment of the difficulties that arise when certain of them are
misunderstood or ignored, lead us to the conclusion that each of these
Principles is necessary to the distinctive nature of the Institute approach.
Indeed, there are other commitments that might well be added—for example,
the requirement of a faculty advisory council of some kind, and more detailed
requirements for a body of Teacher Representatives composed of those actually
participating in the seminars. A revision of the “Basic Principles,” moreover,
would ideally go somewhat further in spelling out the integral rationale
that dictates them and the unfortunate consequences of assuming that certain
of them are peripheral or unnecessary. And such a revision might well also
divide certain of the Principles that contain multiple and quite distinct
provisions. 
</p><p>As we work with the other Teachers Institutes now in operation, we are
also gaining a fuller sense of the necessary balance between being a monitor
of those Institutes and being a senior colleague. This balance has sometimes
been difficult to maintain, especially when those at other sites have erroneously
assumed that this Teachers Institute offers a “Yale approach” rather than
something worked out in collaboration with the New Haven teachers, or when
they have failed to recognize the actual flexibility of this approach and
have mistakenly regarded its basic specifications as hindrances to their
own independence and creativity. Here the learning must be mutual as we
continue to work together.</p></td>

<p>With support in part from the Carnegie Corporation of New York, the
Institute published Number 8 (Winter 1998) of its periodical, On Common
Ground, which has a national circulation to policy-makers, educational
leaders, and funders. The Editorial, “Taking Stock and Looking Ahead,”
surveyed the four years of publication of this periodical, noting the high
points in each Number, and making clear the scope and sequence that had
been planned and supervised by the Editorial Board. It summarized the Institute’s
year of planning for the National Demonstration Project, and it concluded
that On Common Ground would have great potential as a means of disseminating
their experience and their results to a wider readership of those interested
in university-school partnership. 
</p><p>During 1998 and 1999, because funding had not been received for this
purpose, no further Number of On Common Ground was published. Funds for
its continuation are still being sought. In the meantime, plans are being
laid for Number 9, to be published during the year 2000. The periodical
will retain its broad focus on issues concerning university-school partnerships,
but this Number, which had already been designated by the Editorial Board
as focusing on “Urban Partnerships,” will contain a special section featuring
the National Demonstration Project. It will include articles from administrators,
faculty, and teachers at the four new Teachers Institutes. Contribution
of such articles was specified in the Request for Proposals as a condition
of awarding a Grant to a demonstration site. The Editorial Board and the
Editorial Advisory Board are also being reconstituted to facilitate this
new emphasis for the periodical.</p></td>

<p>As indicated in the section on “National Accomplishments,” this first
year of the National Demonstration Project has seen the establishment of
four new Teachers Institutes, each of which has been successfully adapting
the approach of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute to a situation with
quite different needs and resources. There is clearly a desire on the part
of all five Teachers Institutes to continue their collaboration in some
form after the conclusion of the three-year grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s
Digest Fund. At each of the four new Teachers Institutes there is also
considerable interest in the possibility of expansion, either within the
city (Pittsburgh, Houston) or within the state (Albuquerque, Irvine-Santa
Ana). It seems likely that the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute will seek
funding to assist with the establishment of a second group of demonstrations,
perhaps under a variety of auspices. Certainly the visibility of the National
Demonstration Project would be greatly enhanced by an expansion of the
group now established.</p></td>

<td width="85%">Such internal documentation and evaluation at each site
becomes part of a more comprehensive evaluation undertaken by the Yale-New

the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. The four new Teachers Institutes
provide Institute staff, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute Implementation
Team, and other documenters sent by that Institute with full access to
their activities and their documentation, including school and university
personnel and sites. Significant failure to reach stated goals of the demonstration,
or to maintain the demonstration in accordance with the conditions agreed
upon, could result in the termination of the funding. 
<p>Each Teachers Institute submits interim financial reports, annual narrative
and financial reports, and a final narrative and financial report. The
contracts with the several sites spell out in detail the necessary contents
of these reports. 
</p><p>The financial reports contain interim and annual financial accountings
of expenditures made under the terms of this Agreement, including verification
of cost-sharing. They set forth in detail the cost of operating the Institute,
provide a documentation of other funds allocated to the Institute, and
indicate the availability of long-term funding sources. The final report
will provide such accounting for the full term of the Grant. 
</p><p>The annual narrative reports include as attachments two copies of all
brochures, schedules, seminar proposals, curriculum units, questionnaires,
reports, and news articles. 
</p><p>The first report, for 1999, explained how the new Institute is addressing
certain concerns that were noted on the occasion of the awarding of the
Grant. It also described the scope, the strategy, and the demonstration
goals of the new Teachers Institute. It explained the process by which
it has been established and maintained, the ways that it has adapted the
New Haven approach, its current activities, and the progress made toward
the specific goals of the site’s demonstration. Subsequent reports will
include continuing description of the Institute’s activities and progress. 
</p><p>Each report also includes: 
</p><blockquote>1. Evidence that the new Institute is faithful to the key parts
of the New Haven approach (the Basic Commitments outlined in the Request
for Proposals for Implementation Grants) 
<p>2. A summary description of the curriculum units developed by participating
teachers, with information about the teachers’ class-room use of the units
and any other outcomes of their participation 
</p><p>3. A description of the relationship between participating school teachers
and university faculty 
</p><p>4. An account of the ways in which teacher-participants in the seminars
have exerted leadership in planning the seminars, recruiting teachers,
admitting Fellows to the seminars, monitoring their process, and assessing
their results 
</p><p>5. Indication of the incentives for university faculty members and school
teachers to participate 
</p><p>6. An analysis of the participation of school teachers in Institute
activities (using surveys and other instruments developed by the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute and modified as needed in conjunction with the
several partnerships) that documents the number of teachers who apply,
the representativeness of the teachers vis-à-vis the entire pool
of teachers eligible to participate, and the teachers’ and faculty members’
assessments of the new Institute 
</p><p>7. An account of the assistance from the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
that was needed, obtained, and used 
</p><p>8. An analysis of the factors contributing to, and hindering, the success
of the new Institute

Haven Teachers Institute (including responses to questionnaires dealing
with the July Intensive Session in 1999 and the October conferences in
1999, 2000, and 2001) 
</p><p>11. An account of the progress made toward the goal of funding the new
Institute beyond the period of this Grant </p></blockquote>
At least once during the grant period, an annual report will include a
survey of the use of curriculum units by Fellows and non-Fellows in the
school system. Each report will also include a summary that sets forth
in brief compass the accomplishments and impact of the demonstration, the
impediments encountered, the unanticipated outcomes, and the lessons learned
thus far. 
<p>The annual reports may also, at the discretion of the partnership, include
information that it has obtained based on assessment of curriculum units
or system-wide surveys of their teachers. Though the sites may also undertake,
and report on, evaluation of students who are being taught by Fellows in
the adaptations, such evaluations will not be supported by the Grant for
this project or any cost-sharing that is contributed to its budget. 
</p><p>The information gleaned from this documentation will be used for annual
conferences and for directors’ meetings, designed to provide continuing
conversation among the sites, to enable comparison and revision of the
demonstrations in progress. It will also be used to inform the Institute’s
dissemination of the results of the project. It should have great usefulness
for each of the demonstration sites in their local management, planning,
and fund-raising. 
</p><p>The final narrative report from the several sites will summarize the
three-year demonstration in terms of the items covered by the annual narrative
reports and will then answer the following questions: 
</p><blockquote>1. What do you think are the most important outcomes, impacts,
and lessons learned from this project? 
<p>2. How has it changed the way in which your institution or other institutions
may address these issues? 
</p><p>3. What plans do you have for continuing the partnership at your site? 
</p><p>4. Are there any other observations or reflections that you would now
like to make about your partnership’s work under this grant? </p></blockquote>
The information contained in these annual and final reports is being transmitted
with the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute’s annual and final reports to
the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund. Those reports by the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute provide its own supplementary interpretation and
assessment of the National Demonstration Project in accord with the criteria
that have been specified in the awarding of the Implementation Grants.</td>

<p>The DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest fund has contracted with Policy Studies
Associates, a research and social policy firm based in Washington, D.C.,
to evaluate the National Demonstration Project. The evaluation will examine
the implementation of Teachers Institutes at universities and their partner
schools participating in the project from 1999-2002. 
</p><p>The Fund is supporting the National Demonstration Project and its evaluation
to accomplish two goals: to contribute to the professional development
of teachers by supporting partnerships between universities and public
school systems that draw upon the experiences of the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute; and to gather information that will enable others to decide
whether to build similar partnerships using their own resources. The Fund-commissioned
evaluation will provide universities and public school systems throughout
the nation with answers to the questions that they are likely to have about
the utility of the National Demonstration Project as a source of ideas
that they could use to create Teachers Institutes in their communities. 
</p><p>Over the course of their work, researchers will focus on examining and
documenting the following: 
</p><blockquote>• The experiences and perceptions of teachers who participate
in the Institutes, as well as school administrators who interact with the
Institute 
<p>• The recruitment process for participating teachers 
</p><p>• The educational partnerships between the university sites and their
partner schools and districts 
</p><p>• The benefits that teachers gain from participating in the Institutes 
</p><p>• The cost of establishing a Teachers Institute 
</p><p>• Additional information to assist other interested universities and
school systems in establishing their own Teachers Institutes </p></blockquote>
The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and the Institutes established at
the partnership sites are cooperating fully with this assessment of the
National Demonstration Project by Policy Studies Associates. The four new
Teachers Institutes are providing the evaluators from Policy Study Associates
with full access to their activities and their documentation, including
school and university personnel and sites. This external evaluation is
not being used for grant-monitoring purposes, which are entirely in the
province of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. The external evaluation
will complement the information-gathering activities of the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute, and will use and incorporate the information that this
Institute collects.
