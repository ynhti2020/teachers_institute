<td width="85%">During 1999 the Institute received from Arthur Vining Davis
Foundations a grant of $150,000 in support of Centers for Curriculum and
Professional Development in the high schools. Other Centers in elementary,
middle, and high schools receive support from a three-year grant of $139,400
the Institute received in 1997 from the Jessie Ball duPont Religious, Charitable
and Educational Fund. 
<p>In 1999 the William Randolph Hearst Foundation approved a further grant
of $150,000 toward the William Randolph Hearst Endowment Fund for the Institute.
The Institute also began to make use of the three-year grant of $150,000
given in 1998 by the McCune Charitable Foundation in support of the National
Demonstration Project. And it continued to make use of a two-year grant
of $100,000 given in 1998 by the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation to support
operations of the Institute. 
</p><p>A grant from the Sherman Fairchild Foundation of $177,311 and a grant
from the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation of $40,000 are continuing
to provide support for seminars in the sciences for 1999 and 2000. The
Institute also received other gifts and grants from individuals and smaller
foundations. 
</p><p>The four-year support of the National Demonstration Project by the DeWitt
Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund has made possible a restructuring and enlargement
of the Institute staff to include an Assistant Director, Production Associate,
and Financial and Database Coordinator. It has also made possible a new
database for the Institute, which will integrate most of the data in four
categories—accounting, programs, mailing, and fundraising—and generate
various kinds of applications for daily use. 
</p><p>The Institute is currently seeking funds that might be used for seminars
in either the humanities or the sciences. Its principal long-term need
is for an endowment that would provide continuing support for seminars
in the sciences. 
</p><p>The Institute is also preparing to seek funds to support the next phase
of the national initiative. Although the magnitude and duration of this
phase are yet to be determined, its aim will be to assist the continuation
of the group of the Institutes now established and to encourage the creation
of yet other Institutes across the nation. The initiative may well require
a “partnership” between the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and one or
more foundations or funds.</p></td>
