<td width="85%">During 1999, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute continued
to make progress in its two complementary areas of activity: the local
and the national. 
<p>In New Haven it conducted a program of seven seminars for Fellows. It
continued its expansion of Centers for Curriculum and Professional Development
in the schools (with eleven Centers thus far and one more expected in the
near future). It developed further the relationship of its resources to
school curricula. And it pursued its fund-raising to ensure the continuation
of its activity in New Haven and across the country in the longer term. 
</p><p>Progress on the national level has been most notably assisted by a four-year
grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund, and a supplementary
three-year grant from the McCune Charitable Foundation, for the establishment
of a National Demonstration Project. The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
has now completed the first year in a three-year process of working with
four other Teachers Institutes that looks toward the establishment of a
long-term collaboration. This Project has begun to create a network of
Teachers Institutes across the country that can serve as a model for university-school
collaboration. The periodical On Common Ground may become a vehicle for
the dissemination of the progress and results of the Project, in order
to encourage the establishment of yet more Teachers Institutes in other
urban centers in this nation. 
</p><p>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and the National Demonstration
Project have received much attention in the press. Periodicals in Pittsburgh,
Houston, Albuquerque, and Irvine shared the news of the establishment of
Teachers Institutes in those cities. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review carried articles on the achievements of Fellows
in that Teachers Institute. And Robert J. Leeney, editor emeritus of the
New Haven Register, celebrated a “thriving school improvement program”
that has become “a national model.” “The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
is an outstanding program, bringing together educators at all levels,”
said President Richard C. Levin in announcing the National Demonstration
Project. “We are delighted that the Institute will be able to serve as
a national model for similar university-school partnerships across the
country.” </p></td>
