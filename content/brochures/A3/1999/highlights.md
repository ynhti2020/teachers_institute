<td width="85%"><a name="a"></a><b>Introduction</b>
<p>From its beginning in 1978, the overall purpose of the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute has been to strengthen teaching and learning in local
schools and, by example, in schools across the country. New Haven represents
a microcosm of urban public education in this country. More than 60 percent
of its public school students come from families receiving public assistance,
and 85 percent are either African-American or Hispanic. 
</p><p>The Institute places equal emphasis on teachers' increasing their knowledge
of a subject and on their developing teaching strategies that will be effective
with their population of students. At the core of the program is a series
of seminars on subjects in the humanities and the sciences. Topics are
suggested by the teachers based on what they think could enrich their classroom
instruction. In the seminars, Yale faculty contribute their knowledge of
a subject, while the New Haven teachers contribute their expertise in elementary
and secondary school pedagogy, their understanding of the students they
teach, and their grasp of what works in the crucible of the classroom.
Successful completion of a seminar requires that, with guidance from the
Yale faculty member, the teachers each write a curriculum unit to be used
in their own classroom and to be shared with others in the same school
and other schools through both print and electronic publication. 
</p><p>Teachers are treated as colleagues throughout the seminar process. Unlike
conventional university or professional development courses, Institute
seminars involve at their very center an exchange of ideas among teachers
and Yale faculty members. This is noteworthy since the teachers admitted
to seminars are not a highly selective group, but rather a cross-section
of teachers in the system, most of whom, like their urban counterparts
across the country, did not major in one or more of the subjects they teach.
The Institute's approach assumes that urban public school teachers can
engage in serious study of the field and can devise appropriate and effective
curricula based on this study. 
</p><p>Now completing its twenty-second year, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
has offered 136 seminars to 471 individual teachers, many of whom have
participated for more than one year. The seminars, meeting over a five-month
period, combine the reading and discussion of selected texts with the writing
of the curriculum units. Thus far, the teachers have created 1,236 curriculum
units. Over the years, a total of 71 Yale faculty members have participated
in the Institute by giving one or more seminars. Forty-four of them have
also given talks. Thirty-three other Yale faculty members have also given
talks. At this date about half of these 104 participants are current or
recently retired members of the faculty. 
</p><p>The Institute's twentieth year, 1997, had brought to a climax a period
of intensive development of the local program. That had included placing
all Institute resources on-line, providing computer assistance to the Fellows,
correlating Institute-developed curriculum units with new school-district
academic standards, establishing Institute Centers for Professional and
Curricular Development in the schools, and establishing summer Academies
for New Haven students. In that year, while continuing to deepen its work
in New Haven, the Institute began a major effort to demonstrate the efficacy
of its approach in other cities across the country. 
</p><p>This effort involved in 1998 the planning stage of a National Demonstration
Project, supported by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, that has
now established partnerships between colleges or universities and school
districts at four sites that are adapting the Institute's approach to local
needs and resources. Implementation grants were awarded to four new Teachers
Institutes-in Pittsburgh (Chatham College and Carnegie Mellon University),
Houston (University of Houston), Albuquerque (University of New Mexico),
and Santa Ana (University of California at Irvine). These grants make it
possible for them to work with the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute over
a period of three years, from 1999 through 2001. 
</p><p>The two major sections of this report therefore describe what are now
the two complementary areas of activity for the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="b"></a><b>The Program in New Haven</b>
<p>This section of the report covers the offerings, organization, and operation
of the Institute's 1999 program for the New Haven teachers who participated
as Fellows. It draws extensively upon the evaluations written by Fellows
and seminar leaders at the conclusion of their participation. 
</p><p>The report here documents the increasing teacher interest in Institute
seminars, the content of the seminars that have been offered, the application
and admissions process, the participants' experience in the program, and
the preparation for 1999. With respect to long-range planning and program
development, it describes the continuing progress in establishing Institute
Centers for Curriculum and Professional Development in the schools, placing
more Institute resources online, and providing computer assistance to
the Fellows. It sets forth the structure and activities of the local advisory
groups; and it outlines the process of local documentation and evaluation. 
</p><p>We hope that this section of the report will be of interest to all those
who assist in supporting, maintaining, and expanding the program in New
Haven. We also hope that its account of our local procedures may prove
useful to those who have now established new Teachers Institutes in Pittsburgh,
Houston, Albuquerque, and UCI-Santa Ana.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="d"></a><b>The National Demonstration Project</b>
<p>This section of the report covers the second of four years to be devoted
to the National Demonstration Project that is supported by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's
Digest Fund. It begins by describing the roles played by the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute in this Project. It then describes the first year of
common work in which all five of the Teachers Institutes have been engaged.
In doing so, it draws upon evaluations written by school teachers, university
faculty, and directors from the four new Teachers Institutes who participated
in the Orientation Session, the July Intensive Session (with its four National
Seminars), and the First Annual Conference in October-all of which were
held in New Haven. It also describes the establishment of the National
Steering Committee and the National Faculty Advisory Council, groups that
are parallel to those in New Haven. 
</p><p>The report then describes the accomplishments of each of the four new
Teachers Institutes. It sets forth the national accomplishments that have
already occurred and are expected to occur. It comments upon the learning
in New Haven that is also taking place as a result of the National Demonstration
Project. And it describes the ways in which the progress and the results
of that Project are being disseminated and explains how the Institute's
periodical, On Common Ground, will contribute to this effort. 
</p><p>The report then describes the internal and external processes through
which the National Demonstration Project is being evaluated. Internal evaluations
are being conducted by the four new Teachers Institutes and by the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute as monitor of the Grant from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's
Digest Fund. These evaluations are providing a continuing account of the
challenges and accomplishments of the Demonstration Project. The external
evaluation, which is proceeding in collaboration with the internal evaluations,
is being conducted by Policy Studies Associates, commissioned by the Fund
to perform this task. 
</p><p>Looking toward the future, the report then points out the opportunity
for further expansion of the newly established league of five Teachers
Institutes.</p></td>
