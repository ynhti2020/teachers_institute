<td width="85%">A National Advisory Committee, composed of Americans distinguished
in the fields of education, private philanthropy, and public policy, assists
the Teachers Institute with the dissemination, evaluation, and development
of both the program in New Haven and the National Demonstration Project.
New members are invited to serve, from time to time, by the President of
Yale University. In 1999 two people accepted membership on the Committee:
Mary Lee Fitzgerald, Program Officer, DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest Fund;
and David L. Warren, President, National Association of Independent Colleges
and Universities. In advance of National Advisory Committee meetings, members
of the University Advisory Council and the Steering Committee meet separately
and together to discuss program development and evaluation, national dissemination,
and finance. On each of these and any other timely topics they prepare
papers that are circulated to brief the Committee before the meetings. 
<p>As the Teachers Institute plays a leading role in the national movement
for university-school partnerships the National Advisory Committee assists
in determining how to make the most effective contribution to institutions
and schools in other communities. The Committee provides a variety of perspectives
that aid in examining what each constituency for such partnerships would
regard as the best evidence of their effectiveness.

</p><p>The Committee last met on March 6, 1998. It then provided advice on
the Institute’s new ways of working in New Haven schools and on the National
Demonstration Project that has been designed to show that the Institute’s
approach in New Haven can be adapted to establish similar university-school
partnerships under different circumstances in other cities. The Committee
will next meet in the fall of 2000, at which time it will consider the
ongoing process and the results thus far of the National Demonstration
Project. Its meeting will therefore be scheduled to occur shortly after
the Second Annual Conference of the National Demonstration Conference,
and in conjunction with a meeting of the presidents, chancellors, and superintendents
from the five collaborating Teachers Institutes.</p></td>
