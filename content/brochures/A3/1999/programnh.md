<td width="85%"><a name="a"></a><b>The Seminars and Curriculum Units</b>
<p>From its inception, a tenet of the Institute's approach has been to
determine its offerings annually in response to the needs for further preparation
and curriculum development that the teachers themselves identify. In 1999
this process, which is described later in the report, resulted in the Institute's
organizing seven seminars, four in the humanities and three in the sciences. 
</p><p>All seven seminars were assisted by a contribution from the New Haven
Public Schools. With further support from endowment revenues the Institute
offered the following seminars in the humanities: 
</p><center>
<p>"Women's Voices in Fiction,"
<br/>led by Laura M. Green, Assistant Professor of English 
</p><p>"Art and Identity in Mexico, from the Olmec to Modern Times,"
<br/>led by Mary E. Miller, Vincent J. Scully Professor of the History of
Art 
</p><p>"Immigration and American Life,"
<br/>led by Rogers M. Smith, Alfred Cowles Professor of Government" 
</p><p>"Detective Fiction: Its Use as Literature and as History," 
<br/>led by Robin W. Winks, Randolph W. Townsend, Jr., Professor and Chair
of History </p></center>
<p>With support from the Sherman Fairchild Foundation the Institute offered
the following two seminars in the sciences: 
</p><center>
<p>"Human-Environmental Relations: International Perspectives from History, 
<br/>Science, Politics, and Ethics,"
<br/>led by John P. Wargo, Associate Professor of Environmental Risk Analysis
and Policy 
</p><p>"Electronics in the 20th Century: Nature, Technology, People, Companies,
and
<br/>the Marketplace,"
<br/>led by Robert G. Wheeler, Harold Hodgkinson Professor Emeritus of Engineering
and
<br/>Applied Science </p></center>
<p>With support from the Henry and Camille Dreyfus Fund the Institute offered
the following seminar in chemistry: 
</p><center>
<p>"How Do You Know? The Experimental Basis for Chemical Knowledge,"
<br/>led by J. Michael McBride, Professor of Chemistry </p></center>
<p>The following overview of the work in the seminars is based on the descriptions
circulated in advance by the Seminar Leaders, the Guide to Curriculum Units,
1999, and the curriculum units themselves. Each Fellow has prepared a curriculum
unit that she or he will use in a specific classroom. But each Fellow has
also been asked to indicate the subjects and grade levels for which other
teachers might find the curriculum unit to be appropriate. These are indicated
parenthetically here for each unit.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="b"></a><b>Women's Voices in Fiction</b>
<p>This seminar read short fiction and novels by nineteenth- and twentieth-century
English and American women authors. Essays by Virginia Woolf (A Room of
One’s Own), Tillie Olsen (Silences), and Alice Walker (In Search of Our
Mothers’ Gardens) framed the discussion, directing attention to the various
ways in which women’s literary voices have been silenced, and to the rediscovery
in recent decades of their major contributions to the history of the novel.
The novels included Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, Jamaica Kincaid’s
Lucy, Sandra Cisneros’s The House on Mango Street, Gwendolyn Brooks’s Maud
Martha, Kate Chopin’s The Awakening, and Fae Ng’s Bone. Shorter fiction
included Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” and Tillie Olsen’s
“I Stand Here Ironing.” 
</p><p>The curriculum units take a variety of approaches to the literature
of female experience. Several units explore the family—as it appears to
Kindergarten-age children, in the context of Chinese culture, and through
the words of African-American women writers. Two units focus on mothers
and daughters in novels, films, and short stories. Several units place
a single work in its historical context, in its contemporary cultural context,
or in its biographical context. One unit pairs Black and White authors
to illuminate the “ongoing conversation” among American women writers,
and another turns to contemporary short stories by women to engage students’
interest in the aesthetic and formal aspects of literature.

</p><p>A team of three teachers (from grades 1, 2, and 3) and a library media
specialist from L. W. Beecher Elementary School—Geraldine Martin, Jean
Sutherland, Jean Gallogly, and Francine Coss—prepared related units for
a project designed to help students learn about families of different cultures,
using children’s literature written by women authors. 
</p><p>The curriculum units written in the seminar, with their recommended
uses, included: “Sister Outsiders: Black and White Women Writing in America,”
by Leslie A. Abbatiello (Honors American Literature, grade 11); “The Politics
of Gender in The House on Mango Street,” by Angela Beasley-Murray (English

<td width="85%"><a name="c"></a><b>Art and Identity in Mexico, from the
Olmec to Modern Times</b>
<p>In most classrooms in the United States, the history of the Americas
begins with Massachusetts in 1620 or Jamestown a few years earlier. In
this seminar Fellows worked to see alternative strands in American history
and to understand how the question of identity in the past in Mexico relates
to identity in the United States today. Their study of the Mesoamerican
past, the Spanish Colonial era, and modern Mexico covered the Maya and
Teotihuacanos, the Aztec on the eve of the Spanish invasion, the new imagery
that took root in New Spain, the preoccupation with race and class that
was reflected in the so-called Castas paintings, and the remarkable artistic
production in twentieth-century Mexico. 
</p><p>The curriculum units can easily be adapted to different situations and
levels and used in English, Spanish, or ESL classrooms. They have been
developed to respond to state mandates regarding reading, writing, and
mathematics curriculum: they show that such mandates can be met using fresh
and imaginative classroom projects. They range from focused investigations
of Maya and Aztec art and culture to new understandings of the works of
Frida Kahlo. In every unit, hands-on projects play a key role: students
can learn to make a work of modern Mexican folk art or play the rudiments
of Mesoamerican music. Others offer preparation for tackling long-term
projects, such as extensive mural-making. Most also incorporate ways of
using local resources, especially museums and WPA mural programs that can
easily be adapted to other regions of the U.S. Fellows have provided step-by-step
guides to using compasses and learning the concepts of mapping, and they
have made it possible to prepare a steaming platter of fresh tamales. In
two units, they have written short plays that can be produced in the classroom.

<td width="85%"><a name="d"></a><b>Immigration and American Life</b>
<p>This seminar examined primary sources on political debates over immigration
from the founding era to the present, along with secondary sources detailing
the major legislative developments in U.S. immigration history. The first
half examined historical immigration debates, including those between the
Jeffersonians and the Federalists, the Know-Nothings and their opponents,
champions of Chinese exclusion and the literacy test, the adoption of the
National Origins Quota system in the 1920s, and its repeal in 1965. Later
sessions explored current immigration policies and controversies, including
the relationships of immigrants to the U.S. economy, disputes over bilingualism
and multiculturalism, and the impact of immigrants on U.S. politics. Discussions
centered on why Americans historically had favored or opposed various sorts
of immigrants and what current policies should be. 
</p><p>In their curriculum units, Fellows have adapted these themes for students
in a variety of courses at a wide range of levels. One unit comprehensively
documents U.S. immigration history while deriving from it a range of mathematical
exercises; another similarly uses immigration statistics to teach graphing
techniques. Others focus in revealing ways on more particular aspects of
U.S. immigration history. Several feature particular groups of immigrants.
These include the Italians, emblematic of the great immigration from southern
and eastern Europe during the late 19th and early 20th century; Africans,
involuntary immigrants to antebellum America who are only becoming a significant
voluntary immigration stream today; and Puerto Ricans, not truly immigrants,
yet not clearly fully equal U.S. citizens either. One unit uses representative
figures from New Haven’s past to tell the history of immigration in this
city, a microcosm of immigration to America’s northeast. Another focuses
on the Irish in New Haven. Still another reverses perspectives, tracing
how European immigrants affected the first migrants to this continent,
the Native American tribes. One concentrates on a most controversial yet
important issue related to current immigration, bilingual education. Another,
recognizing that the drama of immigration has inspired great American novels,
plays, and films, uses student research on immigration as preparation for
training in acting and dramatic presentations.

<td width="85%"><a name="e"></a><b>Detective Fiction: Its Use as Literature
and as History</b>
<p>This seminar was based in part on Professor Robin W. Wink’s book, The
Historian as Detective. It had two major goals: to get students reading
by introducing them to the single largest body of popular fiction in the
United States—mystery, detective, and spy thriller fiction; and to demonstrate
how historians ask and answer questions by using the fictional detective
as though he or she were a historian. The works read included: Agatha Christie,
The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Geoffrey Household, Dance of the Dwarves;
Colin Dexter, Last Seen Wearing or Last Bus to Woodstock; P. D. James,
An Unsuitable Job for a Woman; Raymond Chandler, The Big Sleep; Robert
B. Parker, Looking for Rachel Wallace; Dick Francis, High Stakes; Adam
Hall, Quiller Barracuda; Ed McBain, Lady Killer; Mary Kittredge, Fatal
Diagnosis; Tony Hillerman, Dancehall of the Dead; Walter Mosly, Devil in
a Blue Dress; John Buchan, The Thirty-Nine Steps; Kenn Follett, Eye of
the Needle (accompanied by the film); Josephine Tey, Daughter of Time;
Ellis Peters, Pilgrim of Hate; James McClure, The Steam Pig; and Dorothy
L. Sayers, Nine Tailors.

Paul E. Turtola, John Mac Oliver, Hoyt G. Sorrells, Barbara W. Winters;
and seminar leader Robin W. Winks.)</font></i>
</p><p>The curriculum units offer material adaptable to a variety of age levels,
from the early grades to advanced readers in high school. They reflect
the four broad categories within the literature: the puzzle novel, or English
“cozy,” represented by Agatha Christie; the private eye novel associated
with Raymond Chandler; the story of steady interrogation of evidence and
of people, of testing the irrelevant clue against the environment, as in
the police procedural, represented by the work of Ed McBain; and the classic
novel of espionage, of the exercise of power over others through the finding
and possession of information and the spread of disinformation.

<td width="85%"><a name="f"></a><b>How Do You Know? The Experimental Basis
for Chemical Knowledge</b>
<p>The goal of this seminar was to develop materials that would encourage
students to ask “How do you know?” and to provide some answers. It was
hoped that these materials would foster delight in mastering the logic
of inference from experimental evidence. Discussions focused on molecular
structure, bonding, and reactivity. The seminar first considered how the
most powerful present methods for observing atoms and molecules work: scanning
probe microscopy, which allows feeling individual particles, and x-ray
diffraction, which revealed the double-helix structure of DNA. After discussing
how quantum mechanics provides a theory for atomic and molecular structure,
the seminar addressed the amazing fact that, in the absence of sophisticated
instruments and theories, 19th century chemists were able to develop a
detailed understanding of molecular structure. Most attention was focused
on experiments from 1780 through the first half of the 19th century, which
established the atomic nature of matter. 
</p><p>The Fellows developed curricular materials ranging from college-level
second year chemistry to kindergarten-level special education. They surveyed,
and incorporated in their units, experimental resources from text books,
the primary chemical literature, and the World Wide Web. Some of them developed
valuable original experiments. In general they developed activities that
would engage the students’ enthusiasm and their minds—including Socratic
seminars on the atomic philosophy of the ancient Greeks, use of playground
swings to discover harmonic motion, close observation of familiar materials,
putting the discovery of molecular genetics in a cultural context, and
graphing important scientific data collected nearly 200 years ago. Some
of the most imaginative activities are those developed for learning disabled
students in elementary and high school. Though accessible to the students
for whom they are designed, they also raise fundamental scientific questions
that would make them appropriate, in slightly modified form, for all levels
of science instruction.

Perspectives from History, Science, Politics, and Ethics</b>
<p>This seminar was designed to help teachers and their students to understand
and critique claims that environmental or health damage has resulted from
human action. Its topics included humanitarian concerns, disciplinary and
interdisciplinary analyses, history and narrative, public sector innovation,
the fragmentation of science and law, private sector innovation, patterns
in arguments and logic employed in environmental debates, scientific uncertainty,
values and ideology, and ethics. These topics were developed through examining
a set of case studies on population growth, food and agriculture, land
use and infectious disease, forest and ecosystem management, watershed
management, indoor air and built environment, energy and climate change,
land use and environmental health, product consumption and waste, environment
and warfare, biodiversity loss, and protected areas. 
</p><p>The curriculum units focus on a great variety of topics, including human-environment
relations in the Doñana National Park in Andalucia, Spain; the response
of plants to pollutants that also affect human health; the relations between
asthma incidence and the environmental quality of the school; the integration
of science and mathematics in interpreting effects of air pollution; the
history and management of a city park, and the geology, hydrology, and
ecology of the river that runs through it; basic concepts of ecology; and
vector-borne disease, especially the transmission of parasites from other
species to humans.

designed for primary level students. Another unit, focusing on issues of
pregnancy and childbirth for students in a transitional school, reviews
some of the diagnostic instruments that have become available in the last
two decades. Another shows how the computer has been adapted for use by
the visually handicapped, though the design of Web sites and Web pages
can either enable or frustrate such persons. Another contrasts modern computer
technology as a revolutionary event with the Industrial Revolution. And
another encourages students to write scientific fiction based upon their

<td width="85%"><a name="i"></a><b>The Process of Determining the Seminar
Topics</b>
<p>Between October and December 1998, the teachers who serve as Institute
Representatives and Contacts for their colleagues had canvassed other teachers
throughout New Haven elementary, middle, and high schools to determine
the topics they wanted Institute seminars to address in 1999. (Please see
Appendix for lists of teacher leaders.) The Representatives met together
twice monthly and communicated individually with the School Contacts with
whom they were responsible for staying in close touch. The Director of
the Institute then recruited Yale faculty members who were qualified and
willing to lead seminars that engaged the desired topics. Their specific
proposals were then considered and approved by the Representatives. 
</p><p>In their evaluations, the 1999 Fellows indicated that the Institute
Representative for their school had been helpful in many ways: by maintaining
frequent contact with them, asking for their views on seminar subjects
for the following year, encouraging and assisting them to apply to the
Institute, and promoting the use of Institute-developed curriculum units.
(Chart 1, reading from left to right, moves from the more helplful to the
less helpful activities of the Representatives.) As a result, 46 (72 percent)
of all Fellows said in the end that they had, while the program was being
planned, sufficient opportunity to suggest possible topics for seminars.
This is slightly greater satisfaction with these arrangements than reported
last year (68 percent).

<td width="85%"><a name="j"></a><b>The Fellows’ Application and Admissions
Process</b>
<p>Having worked with teachers in their respective schools during the preceding
months, the Institute Representatives met on January 5 to receive for distribution
in all schools copies of the Institute application form, brochure, and
descriptions of the seminars to be offered. At this meeting a general presentation
of the subjects of the seminars ensured that all Representatives could
explain to their colleagues the purpose of each seminar. 
</p><p>On January 12 the Institute held an open house for prospective applicants
where any teacher might learn more about the planned seminars from the
Representatives and from the seminar leaders, who attended and conducted
discussions in small groups with interested teachers. 
</p><p><i>(image available in print form)</i>
</p><p><i><font size="-1">School Representatives meeting. (Fellow Stephen P.
Broker.)</font></i>
</p><p>On January 19 the Representatives met to discuss their progress in working
with prospective applicants and to hand in their own completed applications.
The final deadline for teachers applying to the Institute was January 26.
This date was selected so that teachers would apply in advance of the February
school vacation. The office would then have the vacation period to process
application materials, and the review of applications could be completed
during February to provide the earliest possible notification to teachers
who were accepted. 
</p><p>There are four principal criteria for teachers to be eligible for consideration
as Fellows: 
</p><blockquote>1. The applicant must be a current New Haven school teacher
who will be teaching in New Haven also during the school year following
Institute participation 
<p>2. The applicant must agree to participate fully in the program by attending
and coming prepared to all scheduled meetings 
</p><p>and by completing research and meeting due dates in the preparation
of a curriculum unit 
</p><p>3. The teacher must demonstrate in the application that his or her specific
interests are directly related to the seminar as it has been described
by the seminar leader 
</p><p>4. The applicant must also show that the seminar and the curriculum
unit that he or she proposes to write are directly related to school courses
that he or she will teach in the coming school year </p></blockquote>
For some years it has been the policy of the Institute to allow no more
than twelve teachers to enroll in any seminar. The small size of the seminars
is necessary both for the collegiality of the Institute experience and
for the individual attention that each teacher’s work in progress receives
from the seminar leader and from other teachers in the seminar. 
<p>During the planning process 95 teachers expressed definite interest
in participating in one of the seminars to be offered. Of those teachers,
42 were from high schools, 6 from transitional schools, 28 from middle
schools, and 19 from elementary schools. By the application deadline, the
Institute Representatives, assisted by the school Contacts, had obtained
applications from 81 elementary, middle, and high school teachers in the
humanities, social sciences, and sciences, somewhat fewer than the record
numbers of the previous four years. 
</p><p>The individual application form calls for the interested teachers to
specify the subjects and grade levels they teach, the course or courses
in which they plan to introduce the material they study in the Institute,
and their willingness to meet each of the Institute’s requirements for
full participation. The applicants also write a brief essay describing
why they wish to participate in the seminar to which they are applying,
and how the curriculum unit they plan to write will assist them in their
own teaching. Writing this essay is, in effect, their first step in formulating
a curriculum unit through which they will bring the material they study
from the seminar into their own teaching. 
</p><p>The team application form requires the interested teachers to demonstrate
how the team envisions working together in inter-grade and/or interdisciplinary
ways and must outline plans for a culminating activity in the school. Teams
may receive preference during the admissions process, and are required
to submit a final report on their work together during the following school
year. If a team is not admitted as such, however, the members of the team
may be admitted to the program as individual Fellows. And the Institute
encourages such Fellows to work as informal teams in their schools. 
</p><p>The applications were then reviewed by three groups: seminar leaders,
school principals, and seminar Coordinators. The seminar leaders examined
the applications for their relationship to the seminar subject. This afforded
each seminar leader the opportunity, as well, to tailor or enlarge the
bibliography for the seminar so that it would address the specific interests
of the teachers who are accepted. 
</p><p>At the same time, the applications were reviewed in the applicant’s
own school, in keeping with a recent decentralizing of administrative functions
and decision-making in the school district. The Institute’s Representative
for each school contacted the school principal to determine who should
be involved in this building-level review. The intention is to increase
awareness within each school of the projects that teachers wish to pursue
in Institute seminars and to afford an opportunity for the principal and
other educational leaders to examine the relationship between teachers’
applications and school plans. In a letter of January 21, 1998, to all
principals, Reginald Mayo, Superintendent of the New Haven Public Schools,
had said: “We believe this is a highly promising way for ensuring that
the assistance that the Institute provides to individual teachers and to
teams of teachers has the best prospects for advancing each school’s academic
plans.” This process informs the consideration of each application, provides
each applicant pertinent feedback, and often provides a significant opportunity
for Institute Representatives to talk with their principals about the Institute. 
</p><p>As in the past, the Institute formed a group of teachers who served
as Coordinators to assist with the organization and smooth operation of
the seminars. These Coordinators are selected by the Director from the
group of Representatives who had earlier helped to plan the program of
seminars. There is one Coordinator in each seminar. They act as liaisons
between the seminars and a Coordinators’ committee to facilitate the exchange
of information and to provide teacher leadership without diminishing the
collegial rapport within each seminar. A seminar Coordinator must be, and
must intend to continue as, a full-time teacher in one of New Haven’s public
schools. A Coordinator accepts the following responsibilities: 
</p><blockquote>1. To work with school Representatives at the conclusion of
the application process, to serve on an admissions committee to consider
proposals for curriculum development submitted by teachers applying to
become Fellows, and to make recommendations to the Director about whom
to accept as Fellows 
<p>2. To monitor the progress of a seminar through observation and conversation
with participants, and to give progress reports at weekly seminar Coordinators’
committee meetings 
</p><p>3. To report to the seminar members any organizational information which
should be circulated, such as the schedule of any visitors and notice of
Institute-wide activities 
</p><p>4. To act as a resource for members of the seminar, providing information
about unit-writing deadlines, guidelines for writing curriculum units,
computer assistance available to Fellows, copyright procedures, and University
facilities Fellows may use 
</p><p>5. To be available to the seminar leader to provide information on Fellows’
perceptions of the seminar and on Institute policies generally, and to
offer assistance as may be needed 
</p><p>6. To assist with the smooth operation of the seminar by keeping track
of Fellows’ promptness and attendance and the timeliness of their written
submissions, and by encouraging Fellows to make and keep appointments for
individual meetings with the seminar leader 
</p><p>7. To attend and come prepared to weekly committee meetings with the
Director on Wednesdays at 4:00 p.m. (beginning March 1) and to take professional
days as needed for the above purposes </p></blockquote>
When the seminars began, each Coordinator would participate as a Fellow
in a different seminar. At this earlier point they served as an admissions
committee. They met after school on February 3 to conduct a first reading
and discussion of the applications to their respective seminars. They then
contacted all teachers whose applications needed to be clarified or amplified.
On February 10 the Coordinators met again for a full day, by taking professional
leave, for their final consideration of and decisions on the applications. 
<p>During their review, the Coordinators considered the findings of the
school administrators and seminar leaders and made recommendations to the
Director about which teachers the Institute should accept. By these means,
the Institute seeks to ensure that all Fellows participate in seminars
that are consistent with their interests and applicable in the courses
they teach. A meeting of seminar leaders and Coordinators was held on February
25 to discuss the admissions process just completed, and to review the
seminar and unit writing process and the policies and procedures of the
Institute. On February 26 the Institute accepted as Fellows 74 New Haven
teachers, 46 in the humanities and 28 in the sciences. One team of teachers
was admitted with the expectation that team members would coordinate their
curriculum units and work together during the school year, planning cross-grade
and cross-department instruction and school-wide activities. 
</p><p>Consistent with the Institute’s aim to serve the largest possible proportion
of all New Haven teachers, 21 (or 32 percent) of the teachers accepted
in 1999 were participating in the Institute for the first time. Of these
first-time Fellows, 12 were in the humanities and 9 were in the sciences.
About one-quarter (24 percent) were Black, slightly less than three-quarters
(71 percent) were White, and 5 percent were Hispanic.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="k"></a><b>The Fellows Who Were Accepted</b>
<p>Fellows came from 6 of the 8 high schools, 8 of the 9 middle schools,
and 2 of the 5 transitional schools. Of the 27 elementary schools, 11 had
teachers participating. The Institute first admitted elementary school
teachers in 1990; this year 18 (25 percent) of all Fellows were elementary
school teachers. Thirty-three percent were middle school teachers, and
36 percent were high school teachers. Four schools had five or more Fellows;
twelve schools had three or more. Overall, about 27 percent of the Fellows
were 41-50 years old; 35 percent were younger and 35 percent were older. 
</p><p>As Chart 2 shows, about one-fifth of the Fellows (21 percent) had four
or fewer years of total experience in teaching. The Institute attracted
a slightly lower proportion (18 percent) of teachers with 20 or more years
of total experience in teaching. More than one-third (37 percent) of the
Fellows, however, had four or fewer years of experience teaching in the
New Haven school system. Illustrative of the need for the professional
development that the Institute provides, almost half (47 percent) of all
Fellows have been in their present teaching position four or fewer years;
more than three-quarters (76 percent) have taught in their present position
for nine years or less. Thus, even though 54 percent of the Fellows have
10 or more years total teaching experience, almost half have four or fewer
years experience in their present position. These figures help to explain
why many teachers say they need to develop their knowledge in subjects
that they have been recently reassigned to teach, or curricular materials
for students of a different age or background from those they have taught
before. 
</p><p><i>(Chart 2 available in print form)</i>
</p><p>Moreover, as in past years—and as is the case in the school system generally—many
of the 1999 Fellows did not major in college or graduate school in the
subjects they currently teach. As Chart 3 shows, in no field except biological
science did all Fellows teaching a subject have a graduate or undergraduate
degree in that subject. In three fields—earth science, general science,
and physics—no Fellows had a graduate or undergraduate degree in a field
they taught. Of the Fellows teaching in the field of English, only two-thirds
had an undergraduate or graduate degree. Of those teaching in the field
of social studies, fewer than one-fourth had so much as an undergraduate
degree.

<tbody><tr valign="TOP">
<td width="85%">Chart 4 shows the subjects Fellows taught in the 1998-1999
year of their Institute participation. Overall, more than half (52 percent)
of Fellows in the humanities and almost four-fifths (78 percent) of Fellows
in the sciences had not majored either in college or in graduate school
in one or more of the subjects they taught in that year. 
<p><i>(Chart 4 available in print form)</i>
</p><p>Understandably, therefore, when the 1999 Fellows were asked about the
incentives that attracted them to participate in the Institute, they responded
(as Chart 5 shows, reading left to right from the most to the least important)
that the most important incentives were the opportunities to increase their
mastery in the subjects they teach (92 percent), to develop curricula to
fit their needs (92 percent) and materials to motivate their students (92
percent), and to exercise intellectual independence (87 percent). Indeed,
incentives that might be imagined to be important for teachers with access
to Yale University—credit in a degree program and access to Yale athletic
facilities—were notably unimportant for Fellows in the Teachers Institute. 
</p><p><i>(Chart 5 available in print form)</i>
</p><p>As past Institute studies have shown, Fellows are in most respects highly
representative of all New Haven teachers. So, for example, this year’s
Fellows continue to reflect the gender and ethnicity of all New Haven teachers,
though there are great disparities overall between the ethnic and racial
characteristics of New Haven teachers and those of their students. (See
Table 1.) Similarly, the Yale faculty members who have led Institute seminars
generally reflect the wider faculty at Yale.

<p>At the first organizational meeting of each seminar, held on March 2,
1999, the seminar leader distributed an annotated bibliography on the seminar
subject and presented the syllabus of readings that he or she proposed
the seminar would consider. The Fellows described the individual curriculum
units that they planned to develop. This afforded the members of each seminar
an overview of the work they were undertaking together and the projects
they would pursue individually. The bibliographies both introduced the
seminar subject and guided Fellows as they began research on their curriculum
units. One wrote, “The work-load was not light but also was not unmanageable.
We averaged a book a week, two presentations related to the material being
covered, and a discussion of our unit.” Another wrote, “I was able to use
in my curriculum unit several pieces of literature that were assigned reading
for my seminar discussions. This was exciting because this was literature
that I had not previously read.” A third said, “Our seminar leader encouraged
us to research more deeply than was necessary for the preparation of a
secondary school curriculum unit, but the findings were extremely rewarding.”</p></td>

<td width="85%">In contrast, some Fellows emphasized how demanding they
found the reading to be. One said, “Sometimes the seminar became somewhat
overwhelming with many readings, presentations and handouts to prepare,
in addition to our curriculum units and classroom teaching preparation.”
Another said, “Even though the readings were quite interesting, there was
so, so much to read. I found myself skimming through two of the books.” 
<p>The seminar leaders also commented on what they perceived to be the
Fellows’ responses to the weekly readings. One said: 
</p><blockquote>The quality of my seminar was often similar in quality to my
graduate seminars. The Fellows bring experience and judgment to their studies
in a way that is normally missing from an undergraduate seminar. Undergraduates
normally bring stronger technical training in the sciences and mathematics,
but less refined skills and ability to judge context and social relevance
of the knowledge they study. Fellows intuitively understand what will be
effective in the classroom, and they are in the seminar for a specific
and common purpose—to develop innovative curriculum. </blockquote>
Before the second seminar meeting all Fellows met individually with their
seminar leader to discuss their projects. The Institute requires that Fellows
schedule at least two such conferences as part of the unit writing process;
many Fellows, however, meet more frequently with their seminar leader.
At the end of the program, most Fellows (89 percent) said that they had
ample opportunity to discuss their choice of readings with the seminar
leader. 
<p>During the period that preceded the regular weekly meetings, Fellows
continued their reading, both preparing for the upcoming seminar discussions
and working toward a brief prospectus of what their final units would contain.
At the second seminar meeting, on April 6, Fellows submitted this prospectus,
presented their revised unit topics, and began to discuss the common readings.
The regular weekly seminar meetings began on May 4; thereafter Fellows
continued to develop their units in stages, with a first draft submitted
on May 18. The weekly meetings of the seminars continued through July 13,
with Fellows submitting the second draft of their units on July 6 and their
completed units by July 30. 
</p><p>For several years, Fellows have been asked to submit the prospectus,
together with a revised topic of the unit and a list of appropriate readings,
at the time of the second seminar meeting. This allows them a full six
weeks to write a first draft. The due date for the second draft is late
enough to allow Fellows ample time to address the comments they received
on the first draft from other Fellows and from the seminar leader. Although
some seminar leaders have urged that the revised topic, preliminary reading-list,
and first draft be submitted somewhat later, and some have informally instituted
yet another draft between the first and second drafts, a high proportion
of Fellows have been satisfied with this schedule. In 1999, 74 percent
of the Fellows thought the unit writing deadlines occurred at the right
time in relation to the school calendar.</p></td>

<td width="85%">The Institute attaches great importance to the process
through which Fellows develop their curriculum units, and many Fellows
commented upon the benefits derived from following this process. One wrote:
“Our seminar leader was extremely thorough in examining our various written
drafts. Her suggestions related to organization and style were particularly
helpful. She required and extra draft and gave assistance to anyone who
was having difficulty.” Another wrote: “Because writing a curriculum was
my reason for participating in the Institute, I found it extremely helpful
(if somewhat painful) to have input from the other teachers during the
course of writing the curriculum.” At the conclusion of the seminars, most
Fellows indicated that the program schedule (74 percent) and the guidelines
for writing a unit (95 percent) had been useful to them to a great or moderate
extent. 
<p>This year 61 percent of the Fellows said they tried out the subject
matter and 70 percent said they tried out the strategies of their units
in their classroom. Of those Fellows who did, most (69 percent) said that
this influenced what they included in the final units. One wrote, “I tested
out much of the curriculum in the unit on my kindergarten class this year.
It was well received, interesting and engaging for them. As a teacher it
was very rewarding to see my students happily learning from the unit that
I was designing.”

<td width="85%">During the first two months of the program, which serve
as a reading period, all Fellows also met together on Tuesday afternoons
for a series of talks. Ordinarily, at least some current or prospective
seminar leaders are included in this series, while some other faculty members
are invited to speak on topics the school Representatives believe will
be of particular interest to many Fellows. In 1999, as in 1998, the Representatives
decided that all five talks should be given by current seminar leaders.
In this way all Fellows could listen to an overview or an example of the
work their colleagues are pursuing in other seminars—or, as in the case
of Rogers Smith’s talk, learn about a topic for a seminar in 2000. The
talks given in 1999 were: “Human-Environment Relations,” by John P. Wargo,
Associate Professor of Environmental Risk Analysis and Policy; “Women’s
Voices in Fiction,” by Laura M. Green, Assistant Professor of English;
“Electronics in the 20th Century,” by Robert G. Wheeler, Harold Hodgkinson
Professor Emeritus of Engineering and Applied Science; “National Parks,”
by Robin W. Winks, Randolph W. Townsend, Jr., Professor of History; and
“Constitutional Privacy in the 21st Century,” by Rogers M. Smith, Alfred
Cowles Professor of Government.

<td width="85%">Although the talks have recently met with more favorable
response than was once the case, they remain somewhat controversial. One
Fellow wrote: “The talks, although I enjoy them, seem to me to lack purpose.
I feel condescended to, as if I need a brush-up on liberal arts issues.”
Another wrote, in contrast: “I feel that the ‘talks’ are too specialized
at times and not meant to hold the interest of people ‘cruising’ through
the offerings.” And another wrote: “I would like to see a rebuttal provided
for those lectures based upon issues clearly partisan in nature.” 
<p>Most Fellows, however, saw in the talks the purposes for which they
were organized. They said that to a great or moderate extent the talks
provided them intellectual stimulation (94 percent) and a sense of collegiality
and common purpose among Fellows (90 percent). Three-quarters (78 percent)
said the talks were successful in providing an overview of Fellows’ work
in the seminars. Most Fellows (92 percent) also said that the Institute
scheduled the right number of talks. One Fellow wrote: “The faculty present
just enough about the various topics to whet the appetite for more investigation
and discussion.” Another wrote: “The talks were always good, but this year
they seemed more connected, in that they united the various seminars.”
And another wrote: “I thought the talks were very well targeted to the
seminar topics and each offered a general knowledge to others who were
not a part of the specific seminar.” 
</p><p>Many Fellows reported that the talks prompted them to read about their
topics (45 percent), discuss the topics with their students (52 percent),
and discuss the talks with other teachers (74 percent).</p></td>

<td width="85%">As in recent years, the Institute scheduled a session on
curriculum unit writing on March l6, well before the regular meetings of
the seminars began. Before starting on their curriculum units, the Fellows
all need to understand the central role that the process of writing plays
in Institute seminars. As part of their admissions folder, all Fellows
had received Institute guidelines and mechanical specifications for preparing
curriculum units, which outline the Institute writing process and the five
steps for Fellows’ formulating, reformulating, and enlarging their individual
units. During the session on curriculum unit writing, a panel of Coordinators
first spoke briefly to all the Fellows about following the Institute process
for unit development, considering one’s audience, using a computer to write
a unit and put it online, using the computer assistance the Institute and
Yale University provide, and working together with other Fellows in writing
and using units. Then the Fellows were divided into seminar groups, where
each Coordinator led a discussion of purposes and practices in writing
Institute curriculum units. This afforded an opportunity for the first-time
Fellows to learn about the guidelines and other aspects of curriculum unit
writing from experienced Fellows. At the same time, it encouraged experienced
Fellows to share that experience, and it allowed all to discuss how the
completed volume of units might display a range of teaching strategies
and contain a standard form of annotation. By leading these discussions,
the Coordinators also identified themselves as being knowledgeable about
the process of writing curriculum units, so that other Fellows might seek
their advice. 
<p>At the Coordinators’ weekly meetings with the Director, which were held
on the day after seminar meetings, they discussed the progress of each
seminar and gained an overview of the program. In addition, the Coordinators
met with the seminar leaders immediately before the program began to provide
them with information about the teachers who had been accepted and to begin
to define their role in assisting with the conduct of the seminars. Both
seminar leaders and Fellows acknowledged in their evaluations the essential
role of the Coordinators. Almost all Fellows (97 percent) agreed that the
Coordinator had provided teacher leadership without diminishing the collegial
rapport within the seminar. Almost all Fellows also said that the Coordinators
helped them by facilitating discussion of Fellows’ work in progress (95
percent), and by providing information about guidelines and deadlines for
unit writing (98 percent) and about use of University facilities (95 percent).
Few Fellows found the Coordinators unhelpful in any respect. 
</p><p>To maintain current information on the program and to address any problems
that arose, the Institute Director met monthly with the seminar leaders
as a group. This also afforded the seminar leaders, two of whom were conducting
an Institute seminar for the first time, an opportunity to talk with each
other about their approaches to the seminar and experiences in it.</p></td>

<p>The seminars have always been regarded as the core collaborative experience
of the Institute, and each year the Fellows’ comments about the seminars
have been rich and positive. This year the Fellows often were very enthusiastic
indeed. One said: “It has been one of the most positive experiences I’ve
had in the four years that I have participated as a Fellow.” Another Fellow
said: 
</p><blockquote>I felt as if I brought together so many aspects of who I am—teacher,
scholar, writer, student—rather than being forced to be one-dimensional,
as so many professional development programs require us to be. </blockquote>
Yet another Fellow said: 
<blockquote>I applied to work in New Haven in part because the Institute
is available to teachers there. It is the kind of collaborative effort
in which I strongly believe, one that values high standards of teaching
and of scholarship, seeing them as part of the same process rather than
as the province of different levels of teaching. </blockquote>

<td width="85%">Seminar leaders described their seminar in both specific
and general terms. One said: 
<blockquote>For the first five meetings I spoke for perhaps an hour . .
. Beginning with the second hour, we would discuss the texts and the teaching
challenges the texts posed. Where a text was clearly too difficult, violent,
obscure, or raw for an age group, we discussed how this was so and sought
out books written specifically for younger readers. In this the members
of the seminar took the lead. From the sixth meeting forward we went directly
into discussion, for by this time the seminar members were excited about
the material, comfortable with it, and no longer inclined (as two or three
had been) to be dismissive of it. </blockquote>
Another said: 
<blockquote>Once we started teacher presentations, we had two or three
a week. In these presentations, Fellows presented a single lesson plan
of their unit, and the rest of us participated as if class members, whether
3rd graders or high school seniors. The result of these presentations was
a great deal of cross-pollination among Fellows, who learned from each
other and spun off new lesson plans based on what others proposed. Fellows
also eagerly participated in analysis of others’ lessons—and I think this
criticism, both positive and negative, was so active because its basis
was teaching, not scholarship—and the Fellows felt confident in their own
pedagogy and in their ability to criticize the pedagogy of others. </blockquote>
A theme in Fellows’ comments this year, as in many past years, was the
appreciation and understanding they gained of their own and other cultures
as a result of what they read. One Fellow wrote: 
<blockquote>I have participated in the Institute for the last two summers
developing curriculum that I have used in my U.S. History II survey course.
I developed a unit on the Latino experience in America concentrating on
Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and Cubans. We examined myths and stereotypes
about each of the groups and learned to appreciate the strengths of their
diversity. </blockquote>
Another Fellow wrote: 
<blockquote>I was able to draw out from the students their first-hand experiences
as regards their lives in their native countries and their present situations
in their new country. These were all reflected in their use of the languages
when they write journals and essays, discuss orally and listen to each
other. </blockquote>
As some Fellows have already noted, the seminars afford them an otherwise
too rare opportunity to talk and work with other teachers across the artificial
boundaries that often separate grade levels, schools, and disciplines.
Many Fellows this year spoke of the value of the Institute for them in
these respects. One Fellow wrote: “Meeting educators from throughout the
city is useful. I have been able to expand my professional relationships
beyond the walls of my school.” And another wrote: 
<blockquote>Though the group contained four elementary teachers, one from
middle school, and six who taught high school, there was considerable interaction
among members of all groups. It was interesting to experience the varying
reactions of Fellows to the material which was presented and discussed. </blockquote>

<td width="85%">Ever since the Institute’s inception, its participants
and staff have sometimes been asked whether the co-professionalism among
Yale faculty members and New Haven school teachers, for which the program
is widely known, is authentic. The collegiality on which the Institute
is founded is perhaps best illustrated by the mutual respect between Fellows
and seminar leaders that the seminar experience engenders. Comments made
this year, including some already cited above, are representative: 
<blockquote>If I were to advise other faculty about this program, I would
particularly ask them to think about their own childhood educational experiences
or those of their children, just so that their expectations not be too
high. At the same time, I would alert them to the fact that seasoned public
school teachers often have many pedagogic skills unknown to Yale faculty—and
so one can learn a great deal from the teachers. I particularly enjoyed
the way Fellows presented lesson plans this year, and I have a few new
cards up my sleeve for Yale students based on these experiences. 
<p>It is a wonderful and rewarding experience. Each week I truly looked
forward to my sessions. There is a real world engagement often missing
in University teaching that for me is exciting and filled with promise
for social change. I would encourage faculty to consider the Fellows as
colleagues whom they are joining on a journey. The faculty will probably
learn much more than the Fellows. Teaching Fellows is very different from
teaching graduate students or undergraduates. Their level of judgment and
intuition about what will work is quite mature. This makes them a delight
to work with. </p></blockquote>

colleagues. One Fellow said: 
<blockquote>I appreciated my professor’s expertise in her field. She was
also able to balance that with an ability to make what we studied relevant
to the high school classroom. I thought her attention to precise thought
and language use was not only helpful but essential. Shouldn’t we want
to think and write as precisely as possible? Absolutely. </blockquote>
Another said: 
<blockquote>It was truly a joy to see our seminar leader’s excitement and
enthusiasm about his field and to participate in the demonstrations and
experiments he so carefully planned. He certainly faced a challenge in
trying to present very complex material to a group that was, with only
one exception, non-scientists. However, the library media specialist, kindergarten
teacher, second grade teacher, sociology teacher, special education teachers,
and others also had a challenge in connecting the lectures and even the
topic to our teaching experience and needs. </blockquote>
Yet another Fellow said: 
<blockquote>We burst into applause at the end and begged for another seminar
next spring; we felt transformed and yet only at the beginning of our study.
We had also begun a bonding that we were loathe to give up. Much of this
was due to the seminar leader, who is filled with energy, ideas, and respect
for each of us. The seminar leader also introduced sophisticated topics
in sufficient depth and with sufficient questions so that we were intrigued
enough to want to go further. </blockquote>

<td width="85%"><a name="n"></a><b>Relating Seminar Topics to Curriculum
Units</b>
<p>Each Institute seminar must balance the complementary and inseparable
but sometimes competing demands for studying the seminar topic and developing
specific applications of that knowledge for school classrooms. The Fellows,
coming from elementary, middle, and high schools, are obligated to develop
curriculum units that have some demonstrable relation to the seminar topic,
but they are free to work out curricula that enter territory not covered
in detail by the seminar. The curriculum units, therefore, have a diversity
of subject and approach that one would not expect in a regular university
course on the seminar topic. As a result, discussions in the seminar, while
doing justice to the common reading, can also range widely over substantive
and pedagogical issues relating to the curriculum units. Some comments
by seminar leaders and Fellows quoted earlier have already indicated that
each seminar approaches these demands somewhat differently as seminar leaders
strive to strike an appropriate balance. 
</p><p>In recent years the Institute has also encouraged Fellows to build into
their curriculum units both subject matter and skills that are called for
by the local curriculum framework and the state Mastery Test. The various
strategies for incorporating such elements in what may be quite individual
and innovative units can provide stimulating discussion among the Fellows
in a seminar. 
</p><p>In the end, a sizable majority of this year’s Fellows (81 percent) said
that there had been an appropriate balance in seminar between general study
of the seminar subject and Fellows’ work in progress on their units. As
one Fellow put it: “I think there was a fairly good balance between unit
work and the literature being covered. Perhaps more reactions to how the
books we discussed could be or could not be related to the classroom could
have proved interesting.” A few others would have preferred either more
time or less time discussing work in progress. One Fellow complained that
“we never discussed each Fellow’s unit in class because probably we lacked
the time.” But another Fellow wrote, “I would have preferred more time
on the topics mentioned in the syllabus and less time on participant sharing
of lesson plans (even though they were enjoyable.)” 
</p><p>After the curriculum units were completed in July, they were compiled
in a volume for each seminar. In October the volumes were deposited in
the libraries of all elementary, middle, and high schools, so that New
Haven teachers, whether or not they have been Fellows, might use them in
their own teaching. As in the past, the Institute prepared a Guide to the
new units, based on synopses by the authors and their recommendations of
the grade levels and school courses to which their units apply. 
</p><p>The Institute also updated the Index of all the 1,236 units contained
in the 136 volumes the Institute has published since its inception in 1978.
The Index and Guide, too, were deposited in all school libraries and distributed
to the teachers who serve as Institute Representatives for the schools.
A full set of the new curricular resources was provided to those school
district administrators who have responsibility for curricula system-wide.
At the same time, the Representatives conducted an inventory to ascertain
whether each middle and high school has a complete set of all 136 volumes
of units and whether all elementary schools have each of the volumes that
their teachers believe are applicable at those grade levels. 
</p><p>Maintaining a library set of units has proved most difficult in those
schools that do not have a full-time librarian or, in some cases, even
a library. In 1993-94, the Institute therefore sought to determine the
best location for Institute material to be deposited in every New Haven
school, and it has since continued to supply units missing from any collection,
insofar as the volumes have been still in print. As described below, the
Institute has also created an electronic version that makes its curricular
resources more widely accessible.</p></td>

<p>As in past years, Fellows in 1999 spoke of the results of their Institute
participation especially in terms of intellectual growth and renewal. Just
as the opportunity to increase mastery of the subject one teaches was an
important incentive for most Fellows (92 percent) to take part in the Institute,
almost all (96 percent) said that they had gained knowledge of their subject
and confidence to teach it by participating in their seminar. Only one
Fellow differed with the statement that the seminar helped with intellectual
and professional growth.
</p><p>Many Fellows described the Institute experience as having increased
their professional confidence and morale. Several of their comments follow: 
</p><blockquote>Over the course of two years, I have gained a new perspective
on history as an academic subject, as well as a commitment to use history
in teaching other high school subjects. </blockquote>
<blockquote>I find this Institute to be continuously supportive and helpful
in my professional growth. It has been a great networking source, enabling
me to meet other teachers to share information and educational experience. 
<p>The Institute is an intellectual and creative lifeline to many teachers;
it has certainly begun to serve that function for me.

is one of the top three reasons to be a teacher in New Haven. </p></blockquote>

have been full members of the University community, listed in the directory
of faculty and staff, and granted use of facilities and services across
the campus. For most Fellows (86 percent) access to Yale’s academic facilities
such as the library was an incentive for their participation, and 79 percent
reported that membership in the Yale community had been greatly or moderately
useful to them. 
<p>One Fellow said simply: “The opportunity for New Haven teachers to work
with Yale faculty and to have access to the resources at Yale is invaluable.”
Another said, “There was a lot of sharing through an outside specialist
in computer technology, visits to the Yale Art gallery, and visits to the
Yale Art and Architecture building.” And another said: “Having access to
Yale facilities is great and I particularly value using Yale’s libraries.”

other teachers in using the unit they prepared; one-third said they planned
to do so with four or more other teachers. As a group, the Fellows planned
to encourage or assist a total of 233 other teachers. Fellows this year
provided various accounts of the more extended influence the Institute
has had, and will have, for themselves and their schools. Several Fellows
wrote: 
<blockquote>The unit will be team-taught with another Fellow and merged
with her curriculum unit. The unit itself will be available to other teachers
within our school for use in the classroom as a resource. 
<p>I will be able to integrate my material with reading, language arts,
and social studies. Most lessons connect directly to New Haven’s literacy
goals. They will also mesh with the aims of our Social Development curriculum.
I will be able to share some of my class’s experiences with other classrooms
which are members of our school team. Parents are also going to be involved
specifically in some of the lessons I have planned. 
</p><p>With Title II of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, which acknowledged
the arts as core subjects comparable in importance to traditional content
areas, and with testing and local mandates for interdisciplinary curricula,
the push is on for innovative curriculum planning that breaks through traditional
discipline-specific turf boundaries. I feel that the unit I have written
will offer students a variety of approaches to this topic through mythology,
philosophy, history, and creative dramatics, therefore bolstering their
understanding of what they will be learning in their social studies classes. </p></blockquote>

</p><p>Each year we are attentive to the responses of both first-time and veteran
participants because we want a high proportion of New Haven teachers to
become Fellows and we also want the Institute to become a regular part
of Fellows’ professional lives. Both groups cite their own rewards. One
first-time Fellow wrote: “As a professional development opportunity, the
Institute is superior. It allows us to be professionals, to pursue our
interests, and bring those into the classroom.” Another wrote: “This was
my first experience in the Institute and I thoroughly enjoyed and benefited
from it. I especially enjoyed reading and discussing literature with other
adults—teachers from the system. It was stimulating, and a welcome change
from interacting only with students in the classroom. The other teachers
also gave good suggestions for implementing lessons in the classroom.”
And another said: “In many ways, the Institute lifted and lightened this
year for me. It was intellectually stimulating, dignifying, convivial—and
fun. Even as it exhausted me, it gave me new energy.” 
</p><p>For returning Fellows, the rewards of participation do not diminish
over time, because the experience becomes cumulative, and not repetitive
or redundant. In fact, a good many teachers report that the benefits increase
as one has more experience as a Fellow. One returning Fellow wrote: 
</p><blockquote>I am more comfortable participating in the Institute this year
because I am prepared to write the unit and the topic I chose is fun and
interesting in spite of the fact that I read twenty-five books (eighteen
are required and the rest are extras). </blockquote>

<blockquote>This is my fourth year to participate in the Institute as part
of a team effort. This has been extremely helpful both for support in the
Institute and networking with colleagues at one’s school. </blockquote>

<td width="85%">As in every year since 1990, when they became a regular
part of the Institute, elementary school teachers spoke this year of the
advantages of the Institute for them specifically. One said: “It was beneficial
to me as a teacher of young children to interact with those on the high
school level. I believe that the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is one
of the few chances available for such dialogue.” 
<p>Seminar leaders, too, speak of what they gain from participation. They
not only appreciate their expanded involvement in public education and
the University’s home community; they also find that there are often benefits
accruing to their own scholarship and teaching. Presenting their experience
is especially important because the Institute is often asked to explain
the incentives and rewards for Yale faculty members who participate. Several
seminar leaders this year said: 
</p><blockquote>It is a learning experience in many ways. To view one’s subject
through the eyes of a teacher whose students simply do not read is a valuable
corrective to assumptions a university academic often makes. One will learn
about the very great problems of our nation’s schools, problems which have
become much greater over the years I have been teaching in the Institute. 
<p>The main benefit is a sense of having done what you can to help the
community and its youth. Of course one realizes that this is only one candle,
but it’s good to feel you’ve tried. The Fellows are fun to work with, and
it is good to help them have access to Yale’s resources and to see how
grateful many of them are, even when they don’t have the time to use them
fully. The experience may have given me a better sense of where some of
our students are coming from. I did dig more deeply into some topics that
will prove valuable in my academic year teaching. 
</p><p>The primary benefit is the opportunity to reconsider the body of knowledge
we develop and teach to graduate and undergraduate students, to make it
accessible to Fellows and students in secondary and primary education.
In my own field, this has had an important effect in reshaping my research
and scholarship. Schools are now one focus of my research. My work with
the Institute has also made me sensitive to issues that arise from technical
language. I now consider how to express my ideas using language intelligible
to children. The primary benefit of teaching is that the faculty member
is really the student. I have learned more about teaching from my Fellows
than anywhere else in my career. </p></blockquote>

<td width="85%"><a &lt;b="" name="p"></a><b>Teams of Fellows</b>
<p>For the past six years the Institute has admitted teams of at least
three teachers from one school to a seminar with the expectation that the
team members would coordinate the curriculum units they wrote and work
together during the school year, planning cross-grade and cross-department
instruction and school-wide activities. This program, highly successful
in several schools, has encouraged teachers who were previously reluctant
to participate in seminars on an individual basis to apply to a seminar
as part of a school team. 
</p><p><i>(image available in print form)</i>
</p><p><i><font size="-1">Students at the team’s culminating activity at Beecher
Elementary School.</font></i>
</p><p>In 1999 a Fellows team from L. W. Beecher Elementary school once again
participated in the Institute. Members of the team were enrolled in the
seminar on “Women’s Voices in Fiction.” The team’s joint project was “A
Woman’s View of Family.” The related units dealt with gender differences
and similarities in the family; the life, times, and work of Louisa May
Alcott; the Chinese family through the eyes of women authors; and the African-American
family through the eyes of women authors. It is the responsibility of a
team to shape its curriculum units so that they lead to some shared culminating
activity. As in previous years at Beecher Elementary, the use of the curriculum
units in individual classrooms led to a culminating assembly and reception
in the spring that involved the entire school, bringing in administration,
support staff, and parents. One team-member said: 
</p><blockquote>My unit is part of a team effort where my students along with
students from other grade levels will participate in a drama production
on stage. As a result of these efforts, I anticipate that my students will
gain self-confidence in speaking and reading in front of an audience. </blockquote>

<p>The ultimate purpose of the Institute is not only to strengthen teaching
in New Haven’s public schools, but also in this way to improve student
learning throughout the schools. The Institute intends to serve students
at all achievement and performance levels, and Fellows often write their
units for students at more than one level. While most Fellows (73 percent)
reported that their new curriculum units were designed for their “average”
students, more than half (61 percent) reported that they were designed
for their “advanced” students and more than half (56 percent) reported
that they were designed for their “least advanced” students.

</p><p>These excerpts from the plans of several Fellows illustrate the wide
range of unit use in the schools. 
</p><blockquote>I have been able to introduce a difficult, controversial book
by an African-American woman into next year’s English curriculum, which
was badly needed in this district. 
<p>I will teach this unit next year in a team teaching situation, as I
did my science unit last year. This curriculum will serve to motivate my
co-teacher as well as my students. High-interest, hands-on science curriculum
must become a priority in my department. In the past, special education
students have not had equal access to science lab space and equipment.
My science units have proven to administrators that quality curriculum
can motivate low-achieving students as well as deter behavior problems. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Unlike many classroom teachers who often work in isolation
from their fellow teachers, as a library media specialist I develop teaching
and learning experiences and team-teach with subject specialists. I know
that there will be teachers who will be very interested in working with
me so that their students can improve their research skills, both in using
the Internet and in using primary sources. </blockquote>
To attempt to gauge the impact of this year’s units in New Haven classrooms,
we asked Fellows about the number of students to whom they planned to teach
their new unit, and on how many days. Fifty-seven of the Fellows planned
to teach their unit to more than 25 students; 24 of that group said that
they would teach their unit to 50 or more students. The total number of
students to be taught a unit by this year’s Fellows is 2,908. Chart 6 indicates
the length of time the Fellows planned to teach the unit. For all Fellows,
the unit is a significant part of their teaching plans. 
<p><i>(Chart 6 available in print form.)</i>
</p><p>Fellows continue to be optimistic about the responses they anticipate
receiving from their students to the material they had studied and developed
in the Institute. Most Fellows this year (83 percent) agreed that, as a
result of Institute participation, they have a higher expectation of their
students’ ability to learn about the seminar subject. More than two-fifths
of the Fellows (42 percent) strongly agreed with that conclusion. Fellows
spoke about how their own enthusiasm for a subject would motivate students,
and how they planned to involve students more actively in classroom learning.

<blockquote>I believe that my unit will spark a lot of interest among my
students as we examine how women who have raised children relate to this
responsibility. We will read about women who are negligent mothers, women
who nurture, women who struggle with the responsibility of motherhood,
and women who make mistakes as mothers. From here, students will look at
their own mothers or the women who have raised them. Finally, they will
consider their own role as present or future parents. </blockquote>
Another Fellow said: 
<blockquote>I am pleased with the selection of children’s mysteries that
I have built my unit around, and I think this selection will motivate even
my most reluctant readers. The major emphasis on improving literacy will
be well-served with this unit, as its main objectives are to have my students
read widely and write for a variety of purposes including writing a mystery
of their own. I am sure that my experimentation with a number of oral and
written re-telling strategies will extend itself to my teaching of other
subjects in the school curricula (i.e., science, report writing, etc.). </blockquote>

<td width="85%">We also asked Fellows who had participated in the Institute
in prior years to report on student responses they had actually observed
when teaching units they had previously developed in the Institute. Their
comments were very much in the same vein. One said: 
<blockquote>In my school we do a lot of team teaching, combining subjects
such as math and English or social studies and English or science and social
studies. Our students benefited from our participation in the Institute
because they saw their teachers as students; we were role models for them.
They heard us talking among ourselves about our lectures and seminars.
When we used our curricula, we told the students that they had been designed
in our courses at Yale. It gave teachers and students alike a sense of
learning together. </blockquote>
Another Fellow said: 
<blockquote>In a previous unit which examined coastal ecology, students
learned how to measure the pH of water at various points around New Haven
Harbor at different times—after tides or storms. They used this information
to assemble data and conclude when New Haven Harbor is most prone to pollutants.
They also described and classified aquatic life around New Haven and proposed
how pollutants might affect this life. They modeled the concept of bioaccumulation
and extrapolated effects of pollutants in their own lives. </blockquote>
And a third Fellow said: 
<blockquote>The Institute has helped me to build a library of innovative
curriculum units for my classes. We have addressed cultural diversity issues
through units that focus on the poetry and culture of Mexico or the meaning
of traditional Jewish holidays that become alive through literature, food,
dances, and drama. Other units relate to themes on early pioneers, puppetry,
and drama. I have discovered that non-interested students in the beginning
of a project get caught up in the success of others and participate joyfully
along with their peers. Sometimes this is due to a collective effort, such
as making an animated movie in class or participating in a rehearsed drama
production or being filmed reading a piece of one’s own poetry with a puppet
creation. </blockquote>

<td width="85%"><a name="r"></a><b>Participants’ Conclusions Overall</b>
<p>We asked Fellows about the extent to which several features of the Institute
had been useful to them. As shown in Chart 7 below (reading again left
to right from the most useful to the least useful), very few Fellows said
that any aspect of the Institute had not been useful. In fact, except for
the seminar bibliographies and computer assistance, each aspect of the
Institute was regarded as useful to a great or moderate extent, by three-fourths
of the Fellows or more. More than two-thirds (70 percent) responded that
favorably to the seminar bibliographies and two-fifths (40 percent) to
computer assistance. 
</p><p><i>(Chart 7 available in print form.)</i>
</p><p>One seminar leader reached the following conclusions about the Institute
this year: 
</p><blockquote>It’s very valuable for faculty members to learn more about
the conditions in public schools today, the sources of over half our students
and of many of the most challenging ones. A lot will also feel satisfaction
in being a partner in the overall system of education. For me personally,
this seminar was very useful in learning, for example, about experiences
with bilingual education in New Haven, and in seeing the diverse views
of the teachers on our topic. I was forced to rethink some of my own judgments
in light of the information and attitudes I heard, and that’s good, because
these issues really are complex and difficult, with no easy answers. The
rethinking the seminar prompted will undoubtedly affect both my teaching
and scholarship. I’ve given some presentations differently already. </blockquote>

<td width="85%">We also asked Fellows to provide their overall conclusions
about the strengths and weaknesses of the Institute. One Fellow wrote: 
<blockquote>One of the strengths of this year’s program which was different
from past seminars was the availability and use of computer technology.
This has greatly enhanced the Institute since I last participated several
years ago. </blockquote>
For another Fellow, however, 
<blockquote>the most frustrating experience was trying to produce the document
on a disk and using the computer. I do not own my own computer. Although
clusters were made available as well as assistance in how to use the computers,
the lack of one at home proved to be a great hindrance. </blockquote>
This Fellow went on to say, rather surprisingly for a teacher, “it is extremely
difficult and frustrating to learn something and use it simultaneously.”
A third Fellow, who saw no weaknesses in the Institute, wrote: 
<blockquote>The opportunity to participate in a seminar led by a Yale professor
is invaluable. Each seminar over the years that I have participated in
has been, of course, in a different subject area, which has broadened my
knowledge and my perspective. The intellectual stimulation that these seminars
have provided has helped to create a balance in my teaching career as I
work with children for some 6 hours a day and then have the opportunity
to read, discuss, and write about a variety of topics in an academic setting.
I equally value the opportunity to interact with my peers from other elementary,
middle, and high schools. </blockquote>
Despite a range of specific complaints about scheduling and procedures,
the Institute’s offerings were generally received with enthusiasm, and
the results of its program were quite consistently praised. 
<p>In their evaluations, almost all the Fellows said they intended to participate
(73 percent) or might participate (16 percent) in the Institute in one
or more future years. Of the six Fellows who did not intend to participate
in the future, three have said that they are leaving the New Haven school
system. 
</p><p>We should add that there are now 43 members of the administration of
the New Haven Public Schools who have participated as Fellows of the Institute
for periods of one to eighteen years. The increasing presence of former
Fellows in positions ranging from Assistant Principal and Principal to
Assistant Superintendent has clearly rendered the Institute more visible
and has encouraged other teachers to participate in this program.</p></td>

<p>From the Institute’s inception, Fellows have been full members of the
Yale community with access to resources throughout the University. For
several years the Institute has been exploring how computing can enhance
its partnership, because computing overcomes the barriers of time and distance
that can impede collaboration, and because it is a non-hierarchical form
of communication and therefore consistent with the collegiality that is
a tenet of the Institute’s approach. 
</p><p>In 1995 Fellows became eligible to purchase Yale computer accounts,
and a number of Fellows have therefore had Internet access provided in
this way. Although this option remains available, most Fellows now have
other service providers. The Institute will also furnish current Fellows
an Institute e-mail account at no cost, subject to certain conditions of
use. Because at the outset a great many Fellows were unfamiliar with the
use of computers, the Institute had engaged undergraduate and graduate
students to serve as computer assistants to the Fellows, a role modeled
to some extent on that of the computer assistants in the Yale undergraduate
residential colleges. Later, because of an increasing familiarity with
computing, the Institute referred Fellows to its own computer assistants
and to the Internet Information Center, which serves the entire Yale community.</p></td>

<td width="85%">This year, however, the Institute has again offered more
direct assistance from its own office. Because of the benefits to the Fellows
and to other teachers that result from having the curriculum units online,
the Representatives had decided that beginning in 1999, Fellows must submit
their curriculum units and guide entries on disk. They are asked to follow
the Institute’s recommendations on word processing software and hand in
the disk version of their second draft directly to the Institute computer
assistant or the seminar leader, who checks them for formatting errors
and readability. This procedure facilitates the process of putting them

<td width="85%">The electronic resources and services available to Fellows
therefore include many opportunities to learn about and use computing,
regardless of previous experience and expertise. In 1999 Fellows received
computer assistance on a variety of topics, which included getting started
with computing, setting up an Internet and e-mail account, getting started
on the Internet, using the Internet in research and teaching, using Institute
resources online, and word processing and file handling for the preparation
of curriculum units. The Institute is also establishing an online forum
for teachers who are Institute Fellows or who have access to an Institute
Center, through which they will be able to discuss Institute-related topics
and to help each other with computing problems. Discussion on the Electronic
Forum will go on over an e-mail list. Any message sent to the list will
be sent to anyone who subscribes to the list, creating a kind of group
discussion. 
<p>Three-quarters of this year’s Fellows (75 percent) sought to use the
computer assistance available to them. Most who sought help did so in person
(51 percent of all Fellows), many others by phone (27 percent), and some
by e-mail (15 percent). For 46 of the Fellows (58 percent) the availability
of computer services was an incentive to their participation. Most Fellows
who did not use the computer assistance said they did not need it because
of their own previously acquired competence, or because of the availability
of resources at home or school. A few said they did not do so because of
time constraints during the school year. Most who took advantage of the
assistance, however, were full of praise for the expertise, the patience,
and the persistence of those whom they consulted. 
</p><p>Of the Fellows who used the computer assistance offered them, 13 found
the assistants helpful in getting started with computing; 10 found them
helpful in setting up e-mail and Internet access; 17 found them helpful
in using the Internet in research and teaching; 23 found them helpful in
word processing and file handling for the preparation of a curriculum unit;

in this country and abroad. In 1999 we heard from some in Scotland, Israel,
Taiwan, Italy, and Hong Kong. From the very large number of guestbook entries,
it is evident that the curriculum units written in New Haven have been
of great value to teachers and others in the educational community.

the use of technology in education. Your site is fascinating, comprehensive,
professional, and well-maintained.” A school administrator in Washington,
DC, wrote: “I am looking for African-American curriculum guides and resources.
I find this site has some wonderful and very well-developed curriculum
units. Keep up the good work.” A foreign language department chair in Ohio
wanted to share a curriculum unit with other department chairs, to investigate
the possibility of team-teaching such a lesson. A teacher from Michigan

to help with my master’s research, but it will benefit my classroom as
well!” From California we heard: “This would seem to be a great idea. I
volunteer in some local school systems, and this could help me to help

<td width="85%"><a name="t"></a><b>Institute Centers for Professional and
Curricular Development</b>
<p>In 1996 the Institute undertook with the New Haven Public Schools a
new program designed to broaden and deepen its efforts to strengthen teaching
and learning in the schools. It offered several elementary, middle, and
high schools the opportunity to establish an Institute Center for Curriculum
and Professional Development within their buildings. Five such Centers
were established in 1996. In the next three years the Institute has articulated
and refined the concept of the Centers, prepared policies and procedures
for them, and designed, constructed, and delivered special furnishings
to them. 
</p><p>The Institute aims to situate the Centers around the city, targeting
the larger schools, so that the majority of New Haven teachers will have
a Center at their school or at a school near them. Eleven Centers are currently
in operation. They are located at three elementary schools (L. W. Beecher,
Clinton Avenue, and Davis Street Magnet), two K-8 Schools (Edgewood Magnet
and East Rock Global Studies Magnet), three middle schools (Fair Haven,
Jackie Robinson, and Roberto Clemente), and three high schools (Cooperative
Arts and Humanities Magnet, Hill Regional Career, and Wilbur Cross). The
Institute hopes to establish a twelfth Center at another high school. 
</p><p>These Centers are not permanent installations but must be annually renewed.
A Center may remain in a school so long as the school has a need and a
desire for it, but it can then be moved to another school. Moving Centers
from school to school increases the citywide exposure to the Institute.
The Steering Committee, which makes these decisions, has developed criteria
for targeting sites. A suitable site must be of sufficient size, with a
critical mass of participants and a sufficient leadership. It must be able
to rely upon a favorably disposed school administration and an appropriate
school plan, and it must be located in such a position that the majority
of the New Haven teachers will have a Center at their school or a nearby
school. 
</p><p>The Institute and the New Haven Public Schools view the establishment
of Institute Centers as a vital component of curriculum reform efforts
system-wide. The Centers carry out school-based plans and address the District’s
“Kids First” goals, which call for more site-based management, improvement
of curriculum and instruction, greater staff development, increased parental
involvement, and improved physical condition of schools. The Centers directly
address the first three of these goals and provide new opportunities with
respect to the last two. They attempt to create in schools a place that
will be conducive to the kinds of conversations teachers have with each
other and with their Yale colleagues in Institute seminars. They are intended
to increase the visibility and use of Institute resources and include teachers
who have not before been Institute Fellows. They disseminate Institute-developed
curriculum units more widely, and help the teachers to learn how to use
curriculum units that are online, explore computing as a means of collaboration,
and apply the Institute’s principles in new ways within the school environment
itself.</p></td>

<td width="85%">The Centers therefore operate from attractive and properly
equipped rooms in the schools themselves, containing special furnishings
designed by Kent Bloomer, Professor of Architectural Design at Yale, who
has led two Institute seminars. Bloomer has designed for each Center two
pieces of furniture that will remind the users that a Center is a way of
bringing teachers together, and that it is a function of the mutual presence
of Yale in the schools and the schools in Yale. Combining utility and symbolism,
these pieces have a solidity and elegance in harmony with the tradition
of design at Yale University, and an evident durability suggestive of the
Institute itself. One piece is a round table, with a hole in the middle,
which provides the “center” about which eight people can sit. The center
of the table is filled with a circular design, the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute logo multiplied as a continuous fret, which is done in tile and
set in cast metal for permanence. The second piece is a very high bookcase,
designed to hold volumes of the curriculum units and other Institute materials,
with hand-plated inlay work across the top that carries the same continuous
fret depicting the Institute logo. A banner continues the logo of the fret
into the room. 
<p>Each Center also contains at least one computer with a high-speed modem
so that the teachers have easy access to the Institute’s Web site. At the
beginning of the 1999-2000 academic year, the Institute upgraded the computer
operating systems at the older Centers to Windows NT. The computers delivered
to the newer Centers have this system pre-installed. Windows NT makes many
notable improvements over the Windows for Workgroups 3.1 platform that
was used previously on the Center computers. It is easier to use, has a
fully graphical interface, and provides greater security. The Institute
also inventoried all Institute resources in the Centers—curriculum units,
center manuals, books, videos, etc.—and replenished them when possible.

<td width="85%">Schools interested in becoming a Center site must apply
to the Institute’s Steering Committee. An application, which requires the
involvement of the school’s principal and management team, must contain
an Academic Plan for the calendar year, describing how the teachers in
the Center will take full advantage of Institute resources while working
on school plans that address the goals of the District. If a school is
selected as a Center site, its Academic Plan must be updated and renewed
each year. 
<p>Schools selected as Center sites become eligible to receive special
resources and incentives from the Institute. These incentives, which are
outlined in the Center booklet, assist with the Center’s development as
well as the implementation of its Academic Plan. 
</p><p>The Centers or Institute Fellows at Center schools may apply for mini-grants
from the Institute to implement approved aspects of their Center Academic
Plan. During 1999 the Centers were supported by grants received in 1995
from the Sherman Fairchild Foundation and the Arthur Vining Davis Foundation
(for high school Centers) and in 1997 from the Jessie Ball duPont Fund
(for new Centers). 
</p><p>The Institute has developed a standard format (Center logs) for all
Centers to use in documenting activities. In the early years Center Coordinators
met monthly with the Institute’s Director to review the activities of Centers
and report on progress. In 1998 the Steering Committee decided to establish
collaborative leadership at each Center, so that responsibility would be
more widely shared and continuity could be more easily assured. A member
of the Steering Committee is assigned to work with each Center’s Coordinating
Team. The members of the Coordinating Team share responsibilities for leading
certain efforts within the Center, including documentation. Team members
complete the required mid-year and end-of-year reports and are encouraged
to document their Center’s work in a variety of ways, including video and
audio tapes, photographs, and minutes of meetings. 
</p><p>The Assistant Director of the Institute is the primary liaison to the
Centers, communicating frequently with Center leaders and visiting regularly
each of the Center schools. She participates in the meetings of both the
Institute Steering Committee and Center Coordinators and assists teachers
in Center schools to prepare applications for mini-grants to support Center
activities. 
</p><p>At the request of Center Coordinating Teams, the Institute now holds
semi-annual Forums on Exemplary Practices and Plans. These Forums have
enabled lively discussion among the teachers and staff members and fuller
exchange of ideas among the Centers. 
</p><p>The Forum held on June 7, 1999, considered a variety of topics, with
presentations by Center leaders on activities at their schools. Steven
P. Broker and Judith A. Puglisi from Wilbur Cross High School spoke on
“Generating Enthusiasm for a New Center”; Lisa M. Galullo from Hill Regional
Career High School spoke on “Handling a Center in Transition”; and Mary
E. Jones from Roberto Clemente Middle School spoke on “Revitalizing an
Established Center.” A series of presentations dealt with curriculum development
activities: Sheldon A. Ayers and Peter N. Herndon from Cooperative Arts
and Humanities Magnet High School on “Designing an All-School Project:
Spanish Cultures Week”; Joseph H. Lewis from East Rock Global Studies Magnet
School on “Identifying Institute Units Related to the School Theme”; Mary
E. Stewart and Toni E. Valshing from Edgewood Magnet School on “Preparing
a Teacher Resource Guide”; and Waltrina D. Kirkland-Mullins and Jeanne
Z. Lawrence from Davis Street Magnet School on “Preparing a Culminating
Activity for Students.” Another series of presentations dealt with professional
development activities: Ida L. Hickerson from Jackie Robinson Middle School
on “Using Center Resources to Develop Curriculum for New Teachers”; Sandra
L. Nash from Fair Haven Middle School on “Introducing Interns to Institute
Resources”; and Francine C. Conelli-Coss and Jean E. Sutherland from L.
W. Beecher Elementary School on “Collaborating in the Use of Units.”

</p><p>At both Forums there was also discussion of topics of general interest
pertaining to the establishment, management, and renewal of the Centers.
The Forums were well-attended and positive in tone. It was clear that the
Centers have in various ways caused teachers to scrutinize many of the
Curriculum Units that are available for their use. They have also become
a means for teachers who may no longer be Fellows to stay involved with
the Institute. Some teachers who came to the Forums had never been Fellows;
and some of the reports mentioned the involvement of yet other teachers
who had not been Fellows. 
</p><p>Several of the Centers this year have had to cope with moving to a new
school facility, with renovations at their site, or with reorganizations
of personnel. The newer Centers have also spent much time and effort in
matters of initial organization. All of the Centers have accomplished a
great deal, however, in spreading the word about the uses of the curriculum
units. We mention here some of the other specific accomplishments and plans
during 1999.</p></td>

<td width="85%">At L. W. Beecher Elementary School, teams of teachers have
taken an Institute seminar every year since 1995, and the planning for
and presentation of the culminating activity continues to involve a great
number of Beecher teachers, students, administrators, support staff, and
parents. During the spring of 1999 the team program involved over 125 students
from all grade levels and required the integration of four units written
during the 1998 seminar, “The Use and Abuse of History in Film.” A team
of four teachers enrolled in the 1999 seminar on “Women’s Voices in Fiction”
led by Laura M. Green, Assistant Professor of English. Another team of
three teachers is continuing its project to identify, classify, and summarize
Institute-developed curriculum units that could be used by elementary teachers
not only in their own school, but also by teachers throughout the district.
The results will be made available to all teachers at New Haven elementary
schools, whether or not those schools have an Institute Center. 
<p>At Davis Street Magnet School, a team curriculum unit on “Exploring
Native American and African Culture through Mask-Making” moved into its
second phase, dealing with African masks. Their work was showcased at the
New Haven Public Library. Extensions of this work on mask-making have now
entered an African-American Heritage Language Arts Program and the Davis
Community School After School Program. Three second-grade teachers also
made use of Institute curriculum units on astronomy when supervising projects
for the Citywide Science Fair. 
</p><p>At Edgewood Magnet School, the Center continues to support the use of
Institute curriculum units as primary resources for teacher-based research
and curriculum writing. A team of 12 teachers has researched online curriculum
units to create a new middle school curriculum for Edgewood entitled “What
If . . . Dual Perspectives on History.” 
</p><p>The new Center at East Rock Global Studies Magnet School has been reviewing
previous Curriculum Units that fit within its Comprehensive School Plan
Goals. It offers Saturday Academies each month that involve parents as
well as students, including “Traveling Around the World” and an “International
Festival.” It also mounted a Summer Academy July 19-30, 1999. The staff
members included one teacher and two assistant principals. A major goal
was preparing sixth-grade students to take the Connecticut Mastery Test.
The curriculum, shaped around two topics, Native Americans and the animal
kingdom, directly adapted five Institute units written over a period of
fifteen years and gained some general material from two others. Students
in one group made a concluding trip to the Pequot Museum in Ledyard, CT;
students in the other group made such a trip to the American Museum of
Natural History in New York City.

<td width="85%">At Fair Haven Middle School there were a great number of
new teachers this year. The Center held an open house to familiarize the
new teachers with the Institute objectives and the ways in which the Center
could help them develop their school plans. 
<p>At Roberto Clemente Middle School the Center has been used extensively
as teachers access the Internet to find information pertaining to Black
History Month, Puerto Rican Discovery Day, International Day, and Hispanic
Pride Celebration. For 2000 the Center plans to encourage more collaboration
among teachers who have not collaborated in the past. There is now an opportunity
for teachers to prepare programs and lessons to include all students (Anglo,
Hispanic, and African-American). The Center’s goal for the year is to have
teachers of diverse backgrounds working together. 
</p><p>Career High School, which has consistently made good use of the Center
and Institute resources, has just become an inter-district magnet school
with dual foci on allied health (medical-related health sciences) and computers
and business. It has moved into a new building and will increase its student
body over the next three years. The school’s principal has relied heavily
on the Center’s leadership team to help prepare the school’s teachers and
students for this transition. 
</p><p>At Cooperative Arts and Humanities Magnet High School the focus of the
Center is upon interdisciplinary work in arts, humanities, history, and
mathematics. The Multi-Cultural Days during February featured Institute
units on Afro-Americans. A mini-grant on African Myths resulted in a 15
minute dramatic video, which is on file at the Teachers Institute and the
high school. Hispanic Cultures Week also brought teachers together to emphasize
materials contained in the curriculum units. 
</p><p>The Center at Wilbur Cross High School is located in one of New Haven’s
two comprehensive high schools. Most of the teachers there have not been
Institute Fellows, and there is a need for professional development. The
goal of this Center for 1999 was to introduce the teaching staff to Institute
resources and give them opportunities to research, write, and implement
curriculum based on those resources and geared to the interests, abilities,
and needs of their students. Members of the Coordinating Team had begun
a two-year process of assessing areas where teachers’ interests intersect
with Institute curriculum units. In November the Center held a school-wide
reception to open the Center and make teachers and administrators aware
of the resources it contains. The teachers who lead Center activities are
beginning to conduct in-service programs for each school department to
describe these resources in greater depth and as they pertain to each academic
discipline. They report that almost all teachers in the school are now
aware of the Center and that at least half have been to the Center. 
</p><p>In December 1999 the Institute announced that, to encourage teachers
in schools that have an Institute Center to become more familiar with and
to use the Center’s curricular resources, it would offer an honorarium
of $150 to those participating in special workshops to be conducted in
January and February 2000. The first hour of each workshop would be devoted
to Institute resources online, including the use of the Institute Web site
and e-mail. The second hour would vary from week to week and would present
various uses of Institute resources, from curriculum projects to Academies
for students to special projects that may be supported by planning grants
and mini-grants from the Institute. 
</p><p>This is a crucial time in the “institutionalization” of the Centers
within the the Institute’s work in New Haven. A grant from the Arthur Vining
Davis Foundations in October 1999 will enable the Institute to add a fourth
high school Center, thereby making Centers available to the great majority
of New Haven’s high school teachers. It will also allow the Institute to
assist with and document the progress of the high school Centers, and to
establish Center work as a regular part of the Institute’s core program. 
</p><p>The Centers will now become a prominent feature of the Institute, to
be emulated by other university-school partnerships as we embark on the
next phase of the National Demonstration Project.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="u"></a><b>Preparation for the Program in 2000</b>
<p>From June through August the Institute identified and approached the
57 teachers who would serve during the 1999-2000 school year as the15 Representatives
and 42 Contacts for their schools. (Sixty teachers had served in these
ways during 1998-1999.) Representatives were selected according to recommendations
of the teachers who served as seminar Coordinators and conversations they
had with persons who had served as Representatives in the past, with other
Institute Fellows, and with some school principals. Because the Representatives
who served in 1998-1999 were widely regarded as effective, we sought a
high degree of continuity of Representatives. 
</p><p>In 1998-1999 the Representatives and Contacts were well distributed
across New Haven schools with 26 (43 percent) representing elementary schools,
15 (25 percent) representing middle schools, 15 (25 percent) representing
high schools, and 4 (7 percent) representing transitional schools. For
1999-2000, there was a rather similar distribution, with 26 (47 percent)
representing elementary schools, 7 (10 percent) representing middle schools,
12 (21 percent) representing high schools, and 5 (9 percent) representing
transitional schools. Whether or not they had a Representative, all schools
had one or more Contacts to serve as a conduit for information to and from
the Institute throughout the school year. (Some Contacts served more than
one school.) Of the Representatives and Contacts, 18 were Black non-Hispanic,
29 were White, 8 were Hispanic, and one was of another ethnicity. Representatives
attend meetings every other week from September to March. They receive
an honorarium for this work and agree in advance to participate in the
program they are planning, whereas Contacts perform many of the same functions
but are not required to participate in biweekly meetings or to commit themselves
to Institute participation. Through the Representatives and Contacts, the
Institute ensures that all teachers throughout the school district may
have an effective voice in shaping a program of curricular and staff development
in which they will then have the opportunity to take part.

</p><p>The Representatives held their first meeting of the new school year
on September 7, 1999, and thereafter met twice monthly with the Director.
On September 21, the Institute held a reception for Representatives and
Contacts, so that they might become better acquainted with one another
and might discuss plans for 1999-2000. That meeting set the stage for another
productive year of their work together. Between meetings, the Representatives
communicate by phone and through school visits with the Contacts for whom
they serve as liaison to the Representatives’ committee. In these ways,
their meetings compile information from, and distribute information to,
teachers throughout the New Haven elementary, middle, and high schools. 
</p><p>By the end of December the Representatives had decided upon the following
seven seminars for 2000: Robert E. Apfel, Robert Higgin Professor of Mechanical
Engineering, “Sound and Sensibility: Acoustics in Architecture, Music,
and the Environment”; Gary W. Brudvig, Professor of Chemistry, “The Chemistry
of Photosynthesis”; Sandra H. Ferdman-Comas, Assistant Professor of Spanish
and Portuguese, “Women Writers in Latin America”; Arthur W. Galston, Eaton
Professor Emeritus of Botany and of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental
Biology, “Bioethics”; Ian Shapiro, Professor of Political Science, “Crime
and Punishment”; Rogers M. Smith, Alfred Cowles Professor of Government,
“Constitutional Privacy in the Twenty-first Century”; and Bryan J. Wolf,
Professor and Chair of American Studies and Professor of English, “Ethnicity

During 1999 the Steering Committee consisted of Peter N. Herndon, Pedro
Mendia-Landa, Mary E. Stewart, and Jean E. Sutherland. The Steering Committee
operates as teacher leaders for each sphere of Teachers Institute work.
It has also assumed responsibility for leadership and assessment of the
Centers. It dealt with the documentation of Center use and activity, the
relations with the school district and with principals, the awarding of
mini-grants and planning grants, the process of renewing Institute Centers
and establishing new Centers, the upgrading of computers, and the installation
of any table disks and banners needed in the Centers. It considered various
topics raised by the 1998 Fellows evaluations, including the new requirement
that Fellows hand in the completed curriculum units on disks. It planned
the two Forums for the Centers that were held in June and December. 
<p>The Steering Committee of 1998 had assisted in planning the January
1999 orientation for those sites awarded Implementation Grants. It had
canvassed teachers at the demonstration sites for their seminar choices
for the July Intensive and planned for topics to cover in the January Orientation
Session and teachers to present those topics. The Steering Committee now
provided very important assistance in planning and carrying out the July
Intensive for the new Teachers Institutes in the National Demonstration
Project. It supervised and carried out with the National Steering Committee
the process of application to the National Seminars. It served as contacts
with the National Fellows before arrival; and it met with the National
Steering Committee in July.</p></td>

<td width="85%"><a name="x"></a><b>University Advisory Council</b>
<p>Yale faculty members advise and assist the Institute through the University
Advisory Council and its Executive Committee, both appointed by the Yale
President. (For members of these bodies, see Appendix.) The Advisory Council
guides the general direction of the program and acts as a course-of-study
committee so that the Institute can certify Fellows’ work to institutions
where they may be pursuing advanced degrees. The Council also advises the
Yale President on the Institute and, more generally, on matters concerning
the University’s involvement with the schools locally and with public elementary
and secondary education nationally.

(Clockwise from left: Director James R. Vivian, Cynthia E. Russett, Sabatino
Sofia, Mary E. Miller, Gary L. Haller, Kent C. Bloomer, and Rogers M. Smith.)</font></i>
</p><p>The University Advisory Council meets once each year; the Executive
Committee meets twice or more each semester. The co-chairs of the Council
meet and communicate frequently with the Director between meetings. Members
of the Executive Committee and the Steering Committee meet jointly from
time to time to share information about their respective activities and
to explore appropriate ways of working together. 
</p><p>During 1999 the Executive Committee met in February, March, November
(twice), and December. These meetings concerned priorities and plans for
the Institute’s work locally and nationally. The following issues received
most attention: If the National Demonstration Project is successful, what
should be the Institute’s role in working with other cities? How ambitious
should those plans be? What should be the Institute’s future work in New
Haven, and its place in the university’s relationship with this city? How
should the Institute plan for a meeting in New Haven of the presidents,
chancellors, and superintendents from the demonstration sites, quite possibly
in conjunction with a National Advisory Committee meeting? How may continuing
funding for work in the sciences be obtained? Acting as the Institute’s
course-of-study committee, the Executive Committee also approved the seven
seminars that would be offered 1999. 
</p><p>On April 29 the full University Advisory Council held its sixth annual
meeting with President Levin. Co-chair Jules D. Prown opened the meeting
by welcoming the members and announcing that during the coming year Rogers
M. Smith would become Co-chair with Sabatino Sofia. 
</p><p>Director James R. Vivian then offered a brief report, in which he emphasized
that the Institute has continued at an undiminished level the New Haven
program for teachers from throughout the school system, has developed three
new Institute Centers in individual New Haven schools, and has assisted
in the establishment of Teachers Institutes in four other cities. He noted
that short-term foundation support has made possible the offering of three
seminars in the sciences this year and again next year, but that the capacity
to offer seminars in the sciences after 2000 remains uncertain. He stated
that he continues to believe that the Institute’s work in the sciences
depends ultimately on securing an endowment adequate to provide the financial
stability to the sciences that the endowment for the humanities has guaranteed.

</p><p>Vivian also noted that the Institute has benefited locally in a number
of ways from the National Demonstration Project. The $2.5 million grant
from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader’s Digest fund has enabled the Institute
to double the size and increase the professional stature and experience
of the full-time staff so that it now consists of an Assistant Director,
Production Associate, Financial and Database Coordinator, and Administrative
Assistant. The Institute has installed a new computer system, and is far
into the process of designing a database that integrates all the functions
of the Institute in ways that will streamline and simplify its work, and
will make possible important research that heretofore would have been more
time-consuming than could be afforded. Participating on the planning and
implementation teams has provided New Haven teachers professional opportunities
they otherwise would not have had, and it has allowed Yale faculty members
to talk with colleagues from other sites about educational matters of mutual
concern. The Institute’s work nationally has helped it to articulate more
specifically what it considers to be the essential features of its work
in New Haven. And it has led participants, especially teachers in the schools,
to a renewed appreciation of the opportunities the Institute provides them
here.</p></td>

<tbody><tr>
<td width="85%">The meeting then focused on both the local program and
the National Demonstration Project. Members of the Executive Committee
to raised a series of questions: Mary E. Miller: What should be the Institute’s
future work locally, given its historic focus on strengthening teaching
and learning of both the humanities and the sciences throughout the whole
New Haven school district? Rogers M. Smith: Which are the types of activities
that are likely to be most important to maintain and strengthen, given
Yale’s concerns for visible contributions but also systemic improvement?
How do we make the activities that we regard as most important more visible?
Rev. Frederick J. Streets: What is the University’s urban policy generally?
Cynthia Russett: What is the place of the Institute specifically in the
University’s relationship to New Haven? Sabatino Sofia: How should we begin
to think about the Institute’s future work nationally, if the demonstration
sites prove to be successful? These presentations led to wide-ranging suggestions.
President Levin spoke of the Institute as “one of the principal engines
driving improvement of the school system.” He suggested that, after the
conclusion of the present Grant, the kind of initiative shown by Director
Vivian should continue, and that New Haven might well become a national
center for the dissemination of the results of university-school partnerships. 
<p>In December, 1999, Thomas R. Whitaker and Bryan J. Wolf joined the Executive
Committee; Paul Fry and Brigitte Peucker moved from the Executive Committee
to the regular Council, and the following members of the faculty were invited
to serve on the regular Council: Glenda E. Gilmore, Paul Gilroy, Langdon

<td width="85%"><a &lt;b="" name="y"></a><b>Local Program Documentation and
Evaluation</b>
<p>Many evaluations of the Teachers Institute demonstrate that it assists
schools in specific ways, and that the results are cumulative. (See especially
A Progress Report on Surveys Administered to New Haven Teachers, 1982-1990
[New Haven: Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, 1992].) In the fall of 1999,
the Institute updated its ongoing study of New Haven teachers who have
been Fellows. This study notes the proportion of eligible teachers from
each New Haven school and department who have participated, the number
of times Fellows have completed the program, and whether Fellows have remained
in teaching in New Haven. It showed that, of the 471 New Haven teachers
who have completed the program successfully at least once between 1978
and 1999, more than half (51 percent) are currently teaching in New Haven.
An additional 43 (9 percent) have assumed full-time administrative posts
in the school system. Thus three-fifths (60 percent) of all Fellows since
1978 are currently working in New Haven Public Schools. These statistics
are particularly encouraging because of the Institute’s determination to
involve individuals who will continue to serve students in our urban school
district. As we noted earlier, the increasing presence of former Fellows
in administrative positions has rendered the Institute more visible and
has encouraged other teachers to participate in its program.

<p>As Table 2 shows, a considerable number of current elementary school
teachers in New Haven (12 percent) have completed successfully at least
one year of the Institute. (Elementary school teachers were first included
in 1990.) As Table 3 shows, 33 percent of New Haven high school teachers
of subjects in the humanities and sciences, 33 percent of transitional
school teachers, and 30 percent of middle school teachers have also done
so. A number of teachers have participated for two to twenty years. Of
those Fellows still teaching in New Haven 35 percent have participated
in the Institute once, 33 percent either two or three times, and 32 percent
between four and twelve times. On the other hand, of those Institute Fellows
who have left the New Haven school system, 56 percent completed the program
only once, and 30 percent took part two or three times. Only twenty-three
Fellows who have left (13 percent) completed the program four or more times.
Thus the Institute’s cumulative influence in the New Haven school system
and its likely effects upon retaining teachers are indicated by the fact
that it has worked in the most sustained way with those who have chosen
to remain in teaching in the New Haven Public Schools.

<p>In 1996 members of the National Advisory Committee suggested that the
Institute engage in fuller documentation of its work beyond the seminars
themselves, and of the wider effects of its program in the school system.
They believed they were hearing from teachers and staff about many valuable
results of the Institute’s work that should be documented in forms that
could be made more widely available. The Institute is therefore now documenting
more fully the work of teams in the schools, the activities of the Centers
and Academies, and the development of electronic resources. This documentation
has been summarized in earlier sections of this report.</p></td>
