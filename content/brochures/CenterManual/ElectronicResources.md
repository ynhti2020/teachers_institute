<p>In the Index above copied from the Web site, you are able to search an alphabetical list of topics.  Simply click on the letter that is the first letter of the desired topic.  This will give you a list of topics that begin with the selected letter.  Scroll down through this list to find the topic you are seeking.
</p>
<p>The search engine incorporated into the Institute Web page provides another method to search for specific curricular resources.  The search engine can be used to search the entire text of all curriculum units or guides for any word or series of words mentioned in the text.  The search engine functions in the same way that a standard Internet search engine does except that it only searches the pages of the Institute Web site.  If you are having trouble finding information on the site, you can simply enter a keyword for that information and the search engine will scour the Web site for any mention of the keywords.  Your search can also be tailored to search the entire site, the units only, the guides only, or the units and guides together.  To tailor your search, click the circle next to the appropriate field (as seen in the search window below).

<p><a name="f"></a><b>Yale Resources on the Center Computer</b>
</p>
<p>By using a Yale University Internet account, the Center computer allows access to many of the University’s research tools which otherwise may not be accessible.  Such tools can speed up the research process significantly.
</p>
<p><b>Orbis:</b>
</p>
<p>Orbis is Yale University Library’s online research and bibliographical information system.  Fellows obtain library borrowing privileges with participation in the Institute and can borrow library materials with their Yale ID.  You can access Orbis from the library Web page at www.library.yale.edu.  From the Web page, go to the Research Tools link and then click on the link to Orbis.  Once on Orbis, you can search over two million titles of books, journals, and maps including nearly complete records after 1977 (about half of Yale's total collection).  Orbis will then provide you with the location and availability of the resource.  For help searching Orbis, see a Reference Librarian or sign-up for one of the Library's computer workshops.  For additional assistance go to the library’s online Orbis help demonstration which can be found on the Web page www.library.yale.edu/instruction.
</p>
<p><b>Online Research Databases:</b>
</p>
<p>The online research databases are powerful tools that provide quick access to digital forms of information.  Many databases provide full bibliographies and some contain full text articles from thousands of different magazines and journals.  The online databases make it possible to read and even print these articles from your computer. Yale’s online databases can be found on the Yale University Library main page. To access the library databases, go to the library web page at www.library.yale.edu.  After accessing the library page click on the Research Tools heading.  From this page you will be able to access all of Yale’s Research databases and Electronic Journals.  While all of these databases can be immensely useful, Nexis-Lexis, ClariNews, and Wilson Web may be some of the most appropriate for finding basic research on current topics.  To access these databases, click on the appropriate label.  If you would like more specific instruction about how to use the particular databases, go to the library’s instruction Web page at www.library.yale.edu/instruction.

<p><a name="g"></a><b>E-mail on the Center Computer</b>
</p>
<p>To promote the use of electronic forms of communication, the Institute provides all Centers with their own Institute group e-mail account.  All Fellows and teachers who are authorized users of the Center computer have access to this account, which can serve as a means to share information with other Center members.  In an effort to facilitate communication among Institute Fellows and seminar leaders, the Institute encourages all Fellows to make use of their public school e-mail accounts also.

<p>There are two ways to check and use e-mail on the Center computers, Eudora and Netscape.  Eudora should be used exclusively to access Center group mail.  A copy of Eudora is installed on all of the Center computers and can be found either on the desktop as an icon or by going to the programs folder in the start bar.  Eudora is a simple and user-friendly way to check your Center mail.  It includes a Windows interface that is fairly self-explanatory and automates most of the functions you will be using.  Folders will be set-up in Eudora so that you can save and file all Center mail in an organized manner.  Because Eudora will be used to check and distribute Center and Institute related group e-mails, logging correspondence will serve as Center documentation for future reference.  Personal e-mail may not be saved on Center computers.  Once you have gained access to the Center computer, you automatically have use of the group e-mail account and can start using it by running Eudora. 
</p>
<p>Because of the way that Eudora is configured your personal and public school e-mails cannot be accessed in this application.  However you may use Netscape to access all Web-based e-mail accounts by going to the provider’s Web site. 
</p>
<p>As always the Institute Computer Assistants will be available to provide support if you have  questions regarding the use of e-mail, please call 432-1097 or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:ynhti-help@yale.edu">ynhti-help@yale.edu</a>.
