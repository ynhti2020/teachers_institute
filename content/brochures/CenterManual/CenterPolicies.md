<p>To ensure that Institute Centers are used to their fullest potential, teachers instrumental in the development of the Centers have established the following Policies and Procedures.  Teachers who wish to use the Center agree to abide by these policies.  Modifications can be suggested to the teachers who coordinate Center activities at your school and must be approved by the teachers who serve on the Institute Steering Committee.  
</p>
<p>Adopted on:  2/19/1996 (last revised 02/06/2002)

<p><a name="a"></a><b>Institute Center Coordinator's Role</b>
</p>
<p>Center Coordinators are selected annually by the Institute Director and serve for the period from January through the following December.  The Center Coordinator forms and leads the Center Coordinating Team, and has primary responsibility for the operation of the Institute Center in his or her school.  With the Team’s assistance, the Coordinator carries out the Center Academic Plan, submitted initially with the Center Application and then yearly resubmitted, reviewed, and renewed.  The Center Coordinators work closely with the Institute Steering Committee.  A Center Coordinator must be, and must intend to continue as, a full-time teacher in the Center school.  By agreeing to serve as a Center Coordinator, a teacher accepts the following responsibilities:  
</p>
<p>1. To <i>carry out the approved Academic Plan</i> for the Center in his or her own school.
</p>
<p>2. To <i>encourage teachers</i> to see the Institute Center as designed to meet their needs, and <i>to take advantage</i> of its curricular and other resources in printed and electronic form.  To <i>serve as a source of information</i> about the Center to teachers—including both those who have and who have not been Institute Fellows—by disseminating information about the resources and activities of the Center, answering Center-related questions, and encouraging all teachers in the school to become familiar with the Center Policies and Procedures.  
</p>
<p>3. To form, chair, and encourage participation on a Team of teachers (and administrators) who lead the Center’s work.
</p>
<p>4. As Coordinating Team leader, to approve, if appropriate, the requests teachers make to use the Center computer and other resources.
</p>
<p>5. To approve, monitor, and report on the expenditure of Institute Center funds.
</p>
<p>6. To <i>monitor the progress</i> of the Center through observation and conversation with participants, and to arrange or make presentations at semi-annual Center Forums.  
</p>
<p>7. To <i>collaborate</i> with other Center Coordinators and the Steering Committee on the development of Centers, the fulfillment of the Center Academic Plans, and, as may be necessary, the revision of the Center Policies and Procedures. 
</p>
<p>8. To <i>meet and communicate with the Institute Center Steering Committee liaison</i> on a frequent basis to discuss the status of the Center and plan Center activities.  (The meetings will typically take place in the Center itself.)
</p>
<p>9. To establish a <i>good working relationship with building-level administrators</i> to keep them up-to-date on Institute participants, activities, materials, and services—and to solicit their advice and assistance. 
</p>
<p>10. To <i>maintain</i> an accurate and <i>complete Center Log and records; to prepare a semi-annual progress report</i> of all Center activities, detailing how these activities have advanced the Center Academic Plan; and to prepare an annual application for Center renewal.  
</p>
<p>11. To uphold and, when possible, improve the dignity of <i>the Center space</i> by arranging for its physical maintenance and by preserving the condition of the printed Center resources, the Center furniture, and the Center computer, quickly notifying the Institute Steering Committee Liaison or Associate Director, as appropriate, when problems arise.
</p>
<p>12. To attend and <i>come prepared to at least one meeting each semester</i> with the Steering Committee and Director to organize the Centers’ work and to plan the semi-annual Forum and other events involving all Centers.
</p>
<p>13. To participate as an Institute Fellow during the year while serving as a Center Coordinator.

<p><a name="b"></a><b>Center Access</b>
</p>
<p>1. <i>Teacher Eligibility</i>:  All teachers are encouraged to use the Institute resources located in the Center, regardless of their past or present involvement with the Teachers Institute.
</p>
<p>2. <i>Student Use</i>:  Although Centers are intended primarily for use by teachers, students may use the Center when two conditions are met:  (a)  the students are under the close and constant supervision of a teacher; and (b) student time in the Center has been scheduled in advance and does not displace or interfere with teachers’ use.  In all cases, teachers have priority over students using Center resources.  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Center Hours</i>:  To be determined by the school’s Center Coordinating Team. 
</p>
<p>4. <i>Center Access</i>:  To be determined by the school’s Center Coordinating Team.
</p>
<p>5. <i>Documenting Center Use</i>:  For reports to funders and other purposes, the Center is required to maintain accurate records of the Center’s use.  Each person who utilizes the Center must document his or her activities by completing a simple entry in the Center Log.
</p>
<p>6. <i>Scheduling Center Use</i>:  To be determined by the school’s Center Coordinating Team. 
</p>
<div align="right"><a href="#top">to the top of Center Policies and Procedures</a></div>
<hr/>
<p><a name="c"></a><b>Use of the Center Computer</b>
</p>
<p>1. <i>Authorized Users:</i>  Each school establishes a procedure whereby the Center Coordinating Team authorizes teachers or other school staff to use the Center computer.  This authorization is provided to the Institute on the appropriate form (a sample appears in section F) so that the individual may be provided a login name and password.  Authorization to use the Center computer must be renewed each school year.
</p>
<p>2. <i>E-mail Account:</i>  Institute Fellows and all teachers who are authorized Center computer users will have access to the Center’s group e-mail account.  All Center users may obtain assistance with e-mail from the Institute Computer Assistants.  
</p>
<p>3. <i>Training</i>:  Before using the Center computer, it is recommended that a teacher first attend a workshop conducted or arranged by the Institute.  This will increase the likelihood that the Center computer will remain functional for everyone.  Check with the Center Coordinating Team for a workshop schedule, or contact the Institute Computer Assistant by phone (432-1097) or e-mail (<a href="mailto:ynhti-help@yale.edu">ynhti-help@yale.edu</a>).  
</p>
<p>4. <i>No Unauthorized Addition to or Reconfiguration of Software</i>:  Only the Institute computer system administrator can add new software or change the configuration of existing software on the Center computer.  No individual folders are allowed on the computer’s hard drive.  Documents must be saved on floppy disks.
</p>
<p>5. <i>No Personal Use of the Center Computer</i>:  The Center is intended as a place where teachers can research and develop new classroom curricula.  The Center computer is not to be used for purposes outside this domain.  Personal use of the Center computer is prohibited.
</p>
<p>6. <i>Time Limits</i>:  Even though there is no rate-charge for using the Internet account on the Center computer, please limit your time on the Center computer if demand to use it is high. 
</p>
<p>7. <i>Computer Maintenance</i>:  If a problem arises with the Center computer, a teacher should first contact the teachers in charge of overseeing Center activities.  If these teachers are not available, he or she should contact the Institute Computer Assistant.
