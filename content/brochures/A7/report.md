This conference, hosted by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and made
possible by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund with further support
from the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the National Endowment for
the Humanities, brought together teams of representatives from 27 school-
college partnerships from across the country.
</td></tr><tr><td>
The key-note of the conference was diversity-of program, educational
concern, political position, and personal point of view. Teachers and
administrators from public and private universities, liberal arts
colleges, community colleges, and demographically various public schools
took this occasion to speak out-often with great passion-on the challenges
and the opportunities for the collaborative movement.
</td></tr><tr><td>The results were provocative rather than definitive. To the most
urgent problems a variety of solutions were proposed. But the conference
itself was an important step in the direction of fuller communication and
strategic collaboration among programs of great diversity. It was also an
important demonstration that school-college partnerships, in a variety of
forms, are able to meet some of the most serious needs in our educational
system.
<p>The conference was planned to address a series of issues: the content,
process, and products of school-college collaboration; and the structure,
evaluation, and financing of collaborative programs. In consultation with
the programs planning to attend, the Teachers Institute laid out a
sequence of sessions that would address these issues. It asked each
program to suggest specific subtopics that should be taken up, and it
distributed the responses as a 'de for discussion. Over the two days of
the conference, however, a number of continuing themes emerged that
deserve special mention:

<h3>Conference Themes</h3>
<h4>"Content" and Pedagogy:" </h4>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
Some participants appear to regard "content' and "pedagogy" as quite
distinct areas of concern, and may even define their own programs as
emphasizing one or the other. Others are convinced that every "content"
field contains principles and procedures that provide major clues to
"pedagogical" strategies, and that attention to "pedagogy" divorced from
intellectual content is stultifying or self-deceptive. Indeed, some
misunderstandings may have resulted from a hasty separation of these
concepts from each other. <i>Teaching in New Haven: The Common Challenge,
</i>a compilation of curriculum units developed in Teachers Institute
seminars over the past fourteen years, suggested to some participants that
the Yale program emphasizes "pedagogy," whereas in fact its seminars are
devoted to the interrelations between the study of subject-matter fields
and the needs of the classroom. Some faculty members from both schools and
universities were quick to point out that if a subject-matter is
understood as a field of inquiry and communication, this opposition
disappears. In the final plenary session, Robin Winks, Professor of
History at Yale, remarked that for the historian "teaching <u>is</u> 
research,
and history <u>is</u> communicating." And in the same session Professor
Jay
Robinson, from the Center for Educational Improvement at the University of
Michigan, argued that we must cease to think in terms of such easy and
misleading oppositions as "content" and "pedagogy" or "teachers" and
"administrators." Only then can we begin to understand the full resources
for collaboration that are disguised by verbal and sometimes political
distinctions between "schools" and "universities," "teachers" and
"faculty," "teachers" and "principals"-or, for that matter, "liberal arts
colleges" and "schools of education."

<h4>Curricular Reform and Assessment</h4>
Some participants in the conference believe that the
revitalizing of teachers and the creation of individual curriculum units
can lead to significant grass-roots reform in primary and secondary
education. Others see a need for more extensive negotiation with school
administrations and some modification of the usual school hierarchy.  The
various roles of school principals and subject coordinators was a topic of
often impassioned discussion. Perhaps we need a fuller sharing of the ways
in which school organization can in some places facilitate rather than
hinder the necessary changes in curriculum. All participants seemed to
agree, in any case, that we must seek further involvement of government,
of communities, and of the private sector in our collaborative efforts,
and that we must proceed apace with the recruitment of additional
institutions and of additional teachers and administrators within all
participating institutions.  There was also general agreement that
existing standardized tests may perpetuate inadequate assumptions about
the nature of education, even though perceived as a political necessity.
Alternative modes of assessment must be pursued, with a clear recognition
that they are labor-intensive and may lack a quantifiable objectivity.

<h4>Promulgation and Dissemination:</h4>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td> Some participants are more optimistic than others about the
possibility
of interesting the public and private sectors in supporting collaborative
programs. There seemed broad agreement, however, that enduring bases for
programs must be found, and that they may require new accommodations among
the partners. Tom Furtado of United Technologies spoke in some detail, for
example, of resistances from schools in the Hartford area to offers of
assistance from private industries active in scientific and technological
fields. And yet participants from Cambridge, MA, urged that a
four­way collaboration­schools, colleges, community services,
and businesses­had in their experience proven its success. It seems
clear that even among programs committed to collaboration, mutual
cooperation is often difficult. We must therefore find areas of common
need and modes of mutual assistance. An electronic network? National
seminars that would introduce selected teachers and possibly
administrators to the process of a given program? Through more intimate
and extensive acquaintance, we might yet build a national movement of some
substance and power.

<h3>Conference Sessions</h3>
<h4>Opening Session: </h4>
The conference began with remarks by Sheila W. Wellington, Secretary of
Yale University; Donna V. Dunlop, Program Director of DeWitt
Wallace­Reader's Digest Fund; and James R. Vivian, Director of the
Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute. Donna Dunlop congratulated the
participants on finding ways to make collaboration work, and asked them to
share their views on the characteristics of successful collaboration and
the barriers to such success. She urged the conference to keep in mind the
desirability of a coherent educational process from kindergarten through
graduate school.

<h4>Panel Discussion on Teaching in <i>New Haven: The Common
Challenge:</i></h4>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
This panel, moderated by Thomas R. Whitaker, Professor of English at
Yale, included also Peter P. Wegener, Professor Emertius of Engineering
and Applied Science at Yale and five teachers from the New Haven schools:
William J. Derry, Drama Teacher in the Comprehensive Arts Program; Lois
Van Wagner, Science Teacher at East Rock School; Hermine E. Smikle,
Mathematics Teacher at Roberto Clemente Middle School; Sylvia D. Ducach,
Foreign Language Teacher at Betsy Ross Arts Magnet School; and Jane K.
Marshall, English Teacher at Cooperative High School. Members of the panel
spoke of how the Institute seminars are formed in response to teachers'
needs and interests, offer courses of common reading, and provide contexts
for the development of individual curriculum units. They spoke also of how
the seminars offer models of community learning that can be replicated in
the schools, how the writing process contributes to "teacher empowerment,"
and how individual units reflect the enthusiasm of teachers and meet the
needs of students. The discussion touched upon the effect of these
seminars upon Yale faculty, the possibility of enrolling teams of teachers
from given schools, ways in which the enthusiasm of seminar members might
spread to others, and the relations of individual curriculum units to
other levels of instruction.

<h4>Remarks by President Schmidt:</h4>
Mr. Vivian introduced Benno C. Schmidt, President of Yale University,
expressing gratitude for his support of the Yale­ New Haven Teachers
Institute and the collaborative movement of which it is a part. President
Schmidt spoke of the importance of such collaborative endeavors in
promoting educational change, emphasized the need for permanent bases for
these endeavors, and thanked the DeWitt Wallace­ Reader's Digest Fund
and the National Endowment for the Humanities for their contributions
toward such permanence for the Teachers Institute. This conference, he
said, symbolizes Yale's sense of community with the New Haven schools and
with colleges and schools across the country. We all have a great stake in
a common work: the weaving of a seamless web of education in this nation.

<h4>Plenary Session:</h4>
Chaired by Jules D. Prown, Professor and Chairman of History of Art at
Yale, this session raised a great variety of issues. Some were quite
specific: To what extent does the Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute
deal with pedagogical matters? How does it relate to curriculum
coordinators? What effects has it had on Yale faculty? Other issues were
more general: How may professional societies be brought to bear upon the
collaborative process? How can we increase the participation of younger
faculty? Or make use of the contributions of high school students?

<h4>Academic Content of Programs in Sciences and Mathematics: </h4>
Chaired by Robert G. Wheeler, Professor of Applied Physics and Physics at
Yale, this panel consisted of representatives from three programs. Mayda
Carnes, Kids' Net Coordinator, Santa Ana, CA, described this project,
which involves four institutions. She explained the use of interactive
computer programs in projects for English­ and Spanish­speaking
students, and the ways in which they stimulated parental involvement.
Edward C. Kisailus, from the Biology Interaction Group Partnership in
Education, Canisius College, Buffalo, NY, described that effort to upgrade
science content in the schools, with direction from the science teachers
and with community support. Geoffrey Smith, Science Department Chairperson
at Watsonville High School, CA, described a "Gateways" project within the
California Academic Partnership, in which concern for curricular reform is
coupled with attention to access for a broad range of students to science
courses.

<h4>Academic Content of Programs in the Humanities: </h4>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
Adele Seeff, Director of the Center Alliance for Secondary School Teachers
and Texts, University of Maryland, College Park, chaired this session and
began by describing the work of this "content­based program," which
assumes that teachers have the necessary skills in pedagogy and desire
information about recent critical approaches to texts. Jeanette Gaffney,
Foreign Language Teacher at Betsy Ross Arts Magnet School in New Haven,
then spoke of "content" in relation to "pedagogy" in the Institute
seminars. Leo Rockas, Professor of English at the University of Hartford
described that university's Academy for Teachers, which emphasizes both
pedagogy and content in courses that somewhat resemble the traditional
extension program. The general discussion began with questions about how
curricular units can remain fresh over the years, how they can be
integrated into larger structures of learning, and how they may relate to
mandated curricula. This led to some debate about tensions between
standardized testing and individually developed units, and between the
views of teachers and those of principals. Participants agreed that the
most important results of teaching are not easily amenable to quantitative
assessment. We need to develop ways of testing the ability to make
connections, draw conclusions, and communicate the results of an
investigation.

<h4>Teacher Leadership and Administrative Structures: </h4>
Brief presentations on the opportunities and difficulties of leadership
were offered by Dixie Goswami, Executive Director of the Bread Loaf
Writing Grants Program, Middlebury College, who chaired the session;
Sharon Lloyd Clark, Director of the Institute for Secondary Education,
Brown University; Thomas J. Karwin, Coordinator of the
University­School Program, University of California­Santa Cruz;
and Carolyn N. Kinder, Curriculum Specialist at Jackie Robinson Middle
School, New Haven. The discussion focused increasingly on the fact that
teacher leadership often challenges existing structures in the school
system.  What strategies can lead to some reallocation of power and
responsibility? What definition of missions can lead to fruitful
collaboration rather than mere defense of turf? Collaborative programs
must exert some pressure on the system, several participants said, if only
because teachers are not allowed sufficient "planning time" to enable
their participation. And if such programs are to go beyond the preparation
of curriculum to an on­going learning about the educational process,
yet greater flexibility in the system seems required. Page 6

<h4>Incentives for Institutions and Individuals to Participate:</h4>
Chaired by Charles H. Long, Deputy Provost at Yale, this session began
with presentations by Diana Doyle, English Teacher at Betsy Ross Arts
Magnet School; Robert Moore, English Teacher at Hillhouse High School; and
Jean Sutherland, 5th Grade Teacher at L. W. Beecher Elementary
School­all of New Haven­and by Paul Connolly, Professor of
Humanities and Director of the Institute for Writing and Thinking, Bard
College; Cecil G. Miskel, Dean of the School of Education, University of
Michigan; and Deputy Provost Long. The New Haven teachers spoke warmly of
the intellectual and personal growth that the Teachers Institute had made
possible for them. Paul Connolly, starting with the premise that a
teacher's authority comes from an ability to negotiate among disparate
discourses, stressed the incentives inherent in a program that deals with
the relation between language and thought. Dean Miskel listed the
advantages that accrue to a School of Education including the use of
schools as laboratories and the generating of new scholarship­when it
participates in a collaborative program. And Deputy Provost Long spoke of
the difficulties and advantages of supporting a collaborative program at
an institution that has not included such activity in its
self­definition and is facing budgetary difficulties. He concluded by
saying that Yale had now reached the point of regarding the Teachers
Institute as part of its corporate identity.

<h4>Concurrent Presentations: </h4>
Accounts of organizational strategies and opportunities were offered by
Bruce Robinson, Assistant Director of the Education Division, The National
Endowment for the Humanities; Vinetta C. Jones, National Director, Equity
2000 Project, the College Board; and Carol Stoel, Director of School and
College Collaboration, The American Association for Higher Education. They
stressed the great variety of exploration now under way and the need to
prepare for dramatic changes in our school population over the next
decade. This will require academic enrichment, the serving of disparate
populations, the development of appropriate means of assessment, and the
rethinking of administrative structures.

<h4>Address by Fred M. Hechinger: </h4>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>"The University's Neglected Task," an address by the Senior
Adviser, Carnegie Corporation of New York, drew together many themes of
the conference. Universities, he said, must recognize their obligation
toward the entire scope of education in this country. Teachers will not
act as professionals until they are treated as part of a profession. And
faculties of arts and sciences, not just schools of education, must
understand the need for a seamless fabric of education. Mr. Hechinger
warned, however, that only one tenth of one percent of American faculties
are now engaged in collaborative programs. The challenge to the
universities is clear: those already converted to this cause must find
ways of spreading the word among their colleagues.

<h4>Caucuses: </h4>
The second day of the conference began with caucuses of "School Teachers,"
"University Faculty Members," "School Administrators," and "University
Administrators." These sessions were in certain respects both the least
satisfactory and the most satisfactory parts of the conference. In each
there were complaints of being isolated from other colleagues; in each
there was also a remarkable diversity of views frankly aired; and in each,
perhaps, the fractiousness and the candor may have been encouraged by the
very isolation that was criticized.

<h5>School Teachers: </h5>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
The chair, Kelley O'Rourke, English and Social Studies Teacher at the
Betsy Ross Arts Magnet School in New Haven, invited responses to the
conference thus far. There were some negative comments: we are not getting
anything specific to take away; we need more detail about how
collaboratives were put together and funded; we need more small­
group discussions, more hands­on workshops. There were some
constructive suggestions: the next conference should incorporate students,
should be focused on more specifically defined problems encountered by
programs.  After deciding to sit in a circle­which seemed more
intimate and collaborative than the seats in rows­members of the
caucus conversed more freely about a variety of issues. It was urged that
networks be established to distribute the written products of the
collaboratives. Others objected that the programs are so different that
sharing might not be helpful. One participant spoke of problems that
result from the hostility of principals and deans of instruction, and of
the need to empower teachers. Those from New Haven said that teachers may
already have more power than they realize, and that the Teachers
Institute, which is effectively run by the teachers, had not recently
encountered such opposition. Another participant complained that this was
"just another meeting," which would not break down the walls between
teachers and administrators or college faculties. "We should have time to
talk, not just read another paper." But at this caucus such talk was given
its chance. These and other issues seemed to point toward the desirability
of other meetings that might focus on shared problems or specific
strategies.

<h5>University Faculty Members: </h5>
The chair, Jay L. Robinson, began by alluding wryly to "our customary
isolation" from colleagues in the schools. Another participant objected
yet more vigorously to the separation of caucuses. The meeting, the
conference, and the room itself, he said, did not facilitate
collaboration. In a mild act of revolution, this caucus also decided to
sit in a circle. Focusing then on the problems of recruitment, rewards,
and collegiality that the chair had posed, the group offered various
responses. A participant from Cambridge, MA, said that equality could be
brought to the relation between schools and colleges by adding
representatives from community organizations and from business. Another
way, tried at Indiana University, PA, involves the short­term
exchange of jobs between college and school teachers. Another way makes
use of "master teachers" to bridge the gap. It also may be desirable to
abandon verbal distinctions that seem invidious. At Michigan they now
speak of a "K­post grad faculty." It was also suggested that we
should look at collaboration as an opportunity for change in the
universities­the development of new structures and the use of
students in educational research in the schools.

<a name="r">
<h5>School Administrators: </h5>
The chair, Thomas E. Persing, Superintendent, Upper Perkiomen School
District, PA, charged the group to consider issues they had met in
conjunction with collaborative programs. The discussion moved swiftly to
some structural problems: how to establish a working consensus from the
supervisor through the principal to the teacher. Some were pessimistic:
"Schools are the last bastion of feudalism." "What I see in the immediate
future is budget cuts, literal decimation." "If you want to gain power,
try to give it away." Others expressed confidence in the possibility of
shared decision­making, and in the desirability of persuading the
country that teachers (and not outside parties) should design curriculum.
A call for "portfolio assessment" as an alternative to standardized tests
led to yet more sweeping demands for "systemic change" that would alter
the "hierarchical structure" of the schools. Others suggested that we must
find a more genuine relationship between school and work, must extend the
school year, and may have to address failings in the socioeconomic system
as a whole.

<hr/>
<a name="s">
<h5>University Administrators: </h5>
The chair, Manuel Gomez, Associate Vice Chancellor, Academic Affairs,
University of Califomia­Irvine, invited the group to present their
concerns. Among the problems stated: the need to get the real attention of
the president of a university; finding a structure that taps into the
budgetary process; dealing with the fact that "service" is not recognized
at a university; coping with the lack of coherence in a university
structure; the difficulty of obtaining financial collaboration from the
school districts served; and the challenge of constructing a model of more
ambitious school reform.

<h4>Present and Potential Sources of Public and Private Support: </h4>
Nevin C. Brown, Director of the National Conference on School College
Collaboration, American Association for Higher Education, opened this
session by offering an account of legislation now in Congress. He urged
those present to familiarize themselves with these bills, make their
concerns known to their congressmen, and develop long­term relations
with those who represent them. Thomas Furtado, Corporate Ombudsman, United
Technologies, spoke of support for education in the private sector. The
focus now is yet more specifically on mathematics and science, with a
concern for the companies' own bottom lines and recruitment opportunities.
Mr. Furtado spoke of instances in Hartford in which schools resisted or
ignored offers of help, fearing some interference with curriculum. He
added that his company is now emphasizing assistance to collaborative
programs because they offer a greater chance for promulgation of the
experiment. He elaborated on the need for compromise between private
business and the educational system if contributions are to be made,
mentioning specifically the rigidities of teacher certification that
prevent the use of many highly qualified scientists and mathematicians now
retired from industry.

<h4>Program Evaluation: Constituents' Perspectives on Methods and Results
for Teachers and Students:</h4>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
This session, intended to focus on the "Progress Report on Surveys
Administered to New Haven Teachers, 1982­90," turned out to be much
broader. The chair, William Kessen, Professor of Psychology and Pediatrics
at Yale, described the report as one way of evaluating a collaborative
project. The first speaker, Kelley O'Rourke of the New Haven system,
testified to the accuracy of the themes and the responses conveyed through
the questionnaires used by the Institute. These surveys, she said, have
captured the life and energy of the program as experienced by teachers.
Burris Smith, Director of K­12 Instruction, Saginaw, MI, then spoke
of the more general problem of evaluation as experienced by school
administrators. We need instruments that can identify articulateness,
willingness to collaborate, creativity in problem­solving, etc. He
spoke of efforts in Saginaw to use modes of evaluation that require of
students an engagement in a project that involves learning about the
community, preparing of reports, conducting of interviews, and devising of
performances that can convey what has been learned. Rene Castilla,
President of the Dallas Independent School District School Board, TX, then
spoke of how evaluation relates to policy­making. He outlined
demographic changes that dictate reform of curricula and teaching methods.
He said the major challenge was to devise a curriculum for the '90s. A
proposal for radical reform on a national scale would catch attention and
help the collaborative movement to go beyond its currently
small­scale efforts. Gita Z. Wilder, Educational Policy Division,
Educational Testing Service, then returned to the New Haven "Progress
Report." She described it as an excellent evaluation of the Institute
against the goals it has set for itself, which of course do not include
all of the goals for education. She added that more can be done in
assessing the ways in which the curriculum units have contributed to the
school curricula.

</i></td></tr><tr><td>A broad discussion followed, which engaged some important issues:
Is it likely that teachers are growing as a result of such institutes but
that paradigms of education are not changing? Why have alternative
assessments not been developed on a national scale that could avoid the
deficiencies of standard testing? Ms. Wilder pointed to the
labor­intensive nature of such testing and the lack of good
measurement models. Participants then shared ways in which different
programs have coped with the political pressures for standardized testing
and have instituted portfolio assessments, essays, and performances that
can be assessed by the teachers themselves. The session ended with
expressions of frustration over the difficulties of bringing change into
the system.

<h4>Concluding Panel/Plenary Session:</h4>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td> Moderated by Robin Winks, Professor of History at Yale, this
panel consisted of speakers who summed up the major conclusions from the
various caucuses and added their own reflections.  Thomas E. Persing
listed a number of issues raised by school administrators: The problem of
recruitment for collaborative programs; difficult relations between
supervisors and building principals; the desirability of making a school,
and not a central office, the nucleus for a collaborative model; necessary
education in administrative leadership; the need to recognize the
importance of dialogue between the board and teachers; the hard fact that
testing is needed and will be done whether we like it or not; and the
types of decision­making that might be employed in a collaborative.

who had been elected by the teachers' caucus to represent them, stated
that the teachers wish to include administrators in their meetings. For
her the major effect of collaborative programs is the renewal of teachers.
Indeed, school reform must involve the transformation of teachers, which
will then have effects upon the students.

of university administrators: the appropriate administrative arrangements
in a research university to support collaborative activity; the need to
engage the attention of presidents of institutions; the need to move this
work with schools onto more enduring foundations; and the need to connect
evaluation of this work more clearly to student­outcome measures.
"The road ahead," he said, "will be far more difficult than the road we
have already traveled since the publication of A Nation at Risk, even
though the task has already seemed to be like that of Sisyphus." He
challenged us to find ways to create a new ethic of partnership.
</td></tr><tr><td>Jay Robinson reported on the issues raised in the caucus of
university faculty members. He suggested that we must broaden our
understanding of the partnership in collaborative undertakings to include
administrators, students, parents, community agencies, and business and
industry. The university must rethink its responsibility to life outside
its own programs. Changes in testing must respond to the qualities we most
wish to produce in our students. We must find the appropriate textbooks
for changed curricula. And we must cease to think in terms of such easy
oppositions as those between "content" and "pedagogy" or "teachers" and
"administrators."

</i></td></tr><tr><td>In the concluding discussion there were calls for closer
communication, and for some shared action, but the diversity of approaches
in these programs seemed to preclude any transformation of the conference
into a continuing organization. It seemed clear that, amidst our diversity
of aim and strategy, we must find common needs and modes of mutual
assistance. One possibility may be an electronic network. Another may be
"national seminars" that would introduce selected teachers and possibly
administrators to the actual process of a program such as the
Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute. Through a more intimate and
extensive acquaintance, we might create a more effective national
movement.

with the value of this conference and of possible next steps in our
on­going effort. An appendix to this report summarizes those
responses.
