In December 1991, the Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute held a
conference at Yale University on "School­College Collaboration:
Preparing Teachers and Curricula for Public Schools." The conference was
made possible by the DeWitt Wallace­Reader's Digest Fund and was
supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the National
Endowment for the Humanities.  For participants from New Haven, the
conference represented the culmination of several important projects in
different areas of the Institute's work.
<p>
For distribution initially at the conference, the Institute compiled a
volume of curriculum units, <i>Teaching in New Haven: The Common
Challenge, </i>which contains examples of teachers' work in curricular
development during the Institute's first fourteen years. The Institute
also completed a "Progress Report on Surveys Administered to New Haven
Teachers, 1982­1990," which presents a multifaceted account of the
results of the Institute for New Haven teachers, students, and schools.
The conference provided an occasion as well for the National Endowment for
the Humanities to announce that they had awarded a $750,000 challenge
grant to assist Yale in building a permanent fund for the Institute, the
first collaborative program of its type to be endowed as a function of a
university.

<h3>Background</h3>
From the outset, the geographic range of its work has been a significant
question for the Institute, situated as it is within an institution which
exerts leadership in numerous fields and whose own students come from
around the world. So, while the Institute's planners decided that the
teachers who would participate directly in its programs would be from
Yale's own home community of New Haven, they also recognized­given
the magnitude of problems of teaching in America­a responsibility to
be available to assist their colleagues in institutions beyond New Haven.
<p>
The Institute's wider role, thus far, has involved consulting with other
institutions and schools; writing and publishing; developing and
conducting studies and evaluations; speaking at conferences organized by
others; and organizing conferences to be held in New Haven. To date, the
Institute has organized three such conferences.

<h3>The 1983 Conference</h3>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
In early 1983, before the release of the report of the National Commission
on Excellence in Education which brought widespread public attention to
the condition of American schools, Yale cosponsored with the Council of
Chief State School Officers and the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching a national meeting, which was almost without
precedent, on "Excellence in Teaching: A Common Goal." The meeting was
attended by the Chief School Officers and presidents and chancellors from
thirty­eight states and focused on the role that higher education can
and must play in strengthening teaching in schools. The Teachers Institute
was presented as a case study, and the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching released a <i>Special Report</i>at the conference
which lamented how very few collaborative programs then focused on
teaching, even though this is one of the most natural and necessary
alliances between universities and schools.

<h3>The 1986 Conference</h3>
In 1986 the Institute organized a second conference, "Strengthening
Teaching through Collaboration: A National Conference of Teachers and
Administrators from Schools and Colleges." As a result of the recognition
its own program had been accorded between 1983 and 1986, the Institute had
received many inquiries and requests for assistance. The 1986 conference
was therefore designed to bring together from across the country
individuals who were actively engaged in school­college partnerships.
Participation was limited to the kind of programs in which secondary
school teachers and college faculty members collaborate to strengthen
teaching and learning of academic subjects in public schools.
<p><i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
The conference thus afforded an initial opportunity for individuals
working in similar programs in various stages of development to provide
mutual support and assistance and to explore ways in which they might wish
to work together in the future. This was not a meeting on the overly
general topic of school­college collaboration, or succession of
"show­and­tell" descriptions of different programs. Rather, the
conference focused sharply on the programs' respective experiences in
dealing with common issues. In short, it was a conference of practitioners
who were representatives of other institutions and schools with which the
Institute had worked. In contrast to some of the conferences Institute
participants had attended during that period of time, they wanted the
conference they organized to be collaborative in spirit and design, and
they therefore conferred with all the programs that would attend about the
topics and schedule for the meeting and the manner in which it should be
conducted.

<h3>The 1991 Conference</h3>
Because of the favorable response to that meeting, the Institute organized
the 1991 conference in the same manner, which is analogous to how the
Institute organizes its own seminars in New Haven. That is, first, there
was a determination of who­by virtue of their own professional
work­would be eligible to participate. Thus, we identified programs
that were collaborative endeavors of universities and schools which
focused on strengthening teaching and learning in academic subjects in
schools. As sometimes occurs in the New Haven program, because space was
limited, programs were invited to participate in part to ensure broad
geographic representation at the meeting. Second, those identified as
eligible participants were asked whether they wished to take part and, if
they did, what specific issues they wanted to address at the conference in
New Haven. In short, the agenda was shaped around mutual interests.
<p>
Of those who were invited, almost all decided to send representatives to
the conference. Twelve of the fourteen programs which were represented at
the 1986 meeting sent representatives again in 1991. Fourteen of the
nineteen programs invited to participate for the first time in 1991 also
sent representatives. Of the seven programs in both categories combined
which decided not to attend, most were from state institutions where
travel had been curtailed for budgetary reasons. Thus, at the 1991 meeting
there was both considerable continuity of participation with the meeting
in 1986 as well as a much greater length of experience among the
individual programs attending. Overall, representatives of
twenty­seven programs from across the country participated in the
conference. (See Appendix for a list.)
</p><p><i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
In a further parallel to the Institute's own work in New Haven, in advance
of the conference each individual who would attend the meeting received
copies of the "Progress Report" and <i>Teaching in New Haven,
</i>mentioned above, so that everyone would arrive with some common
background. In addition, each program contributed an entry to a Directory
of all the programs attending the meeting so that everyone would have
knowledge of each other's work. Finally, the Institute surveyed all who
would participate about the issues they wished the conference to address,
and compiled these responses into a document which was distributed at the
beginning of the conference, so that everyone participating would know
what issues were of greatest concern to their colleagues.
</p><p>
With respect to the meeting itself, many conference participants remarked
that the conversation throughout was "rich," and as reported below
individual responses to the meeting varied according to position,
programmatic experience, and personal point of view. As there were many
different responses to the meeting, it perhaps would be useful to indicate
here what particularly struck Institute staff, as well as what new plans
we have begun to consider as we take stock of the first fifteen years of
the Yale­ New Haven Teachers Institute.

<h3>Encouraging Developments</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>First, then, what encouraged us in New Haven: We were especially
gratified to see how many of the programs attending the conference
emphasize both teacher leadership and collegiality in
university­school relations, which have been tenets of the Teachers
Institute's approach from the outset, but which characterized a much
smaller proportion of the programs that participated in the conference
five years earlier. We were also heartened to find how many of the
programs with which we have worked through the years have "endured," as
Manuel Gomez put it in his remarks at the conclusion of the meeting. In
1986 we would hardly have assumed this would have been the case, even
acknowledging our own strongly held conviction about the necessity for
long­term collaborative programs.
</td><td><hr/><i>We were especially gratified to see how many of the programs

collegiality in university­school relations.</i><hr/>
</td></tr><tr><td>The conference also attested to a gradual spreading of this type
of collaborative program and the fact that in 1991 many more programs
across the country emphasized the strengthening of teaching than could
have been found­as noted in the Special Report of the Carnegie
Foundation­at the time of the conference in 1983. Furthermore, in
remarks at the conclusion of the 1986 meeting, I had stated an undertow of
concern about how few programs at that time focused their efforts on urban
schools or on the education of students from low­income and minority
backgrounds. We were encouraged therefore to see how many of the programs
attending the 1991 meeting have these emphases.
</td></tr><tr><td>We were pleased, finally, that the spirit throughout the meeting
was collaborative, that participants spoke as colleagues in what we
increasingly seem to regard as a singular education profession. It was
notable that participants in 1991 appeared to have more closely related
practices and longer experiences than was the case either in 1986 or 1983.
In short, the conference exhibited a growing, common understanding of a
language and terms of collaboration, which were imprecise at best at the
time of the first meeting the Institute organized.1

<h3>Implications for the Future</h3>
For all it revealed about the progress across the country of the
Institute's type of collaborative activity, the conference also
underscored for us the potential value of the Institute's future work in
three particular areas. First, the emphasis which we in New Haven place on
a close relationship between teacher preparation and classroom application
is far from universal. In fact, many individuals at the conference spoke
of content and pedagogy, substance and method, as distinct and hardly as
inseparable in the process of teaching and learning. This should concern
us, in part, because­however difficult it is to assess the effects of
teacher collaborative programs on students­attempts to determine such
effects will be more speculative unless the collaborative process pays
direct attention to the connection between what the teacher has learned
and what his or her students may learn as a result.
<p>
Second, then, there still has been only limited, intensive and sustained
work in program evaluation even though, as early as the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching <i>Special Report </i>
in 1983, Ernest L. Boyer spoke of the urgency of such work. He wrote
there:
</p><blockquote>The projects reviewed showed little evidence of evaluation. In
few instances is there any formal documentation that the changes made an
enduring difference. Evidence is needed to show that cooperation is worth
the money and effort. Besides validating what has occurred, this may
persuade other schools and colleges to follow suit.
<p>
This is not an easy challenge to meet. Money for collaborative projects is
scarce, and every dollar diverted to evaluation will be that much less to
be spent on behalf of the program itself. Also, there is the difficulty of
assessing whether a student benefits in the long­run, for example,
from having been taught by a teacher who was helped by a college professor
in preparing the course. Yet, advocates of closer cooperation ought to
have some concern about proving the worth of their projects.2</p></blockquote>
Motivated by precisely this concern, the Yale­New Haven Teachers
Institute for a number of years has devoted considerable resources to
evaluation, as evidenced most recently by the new "Progress Report." In
the future, the Institute will extend its own evaluations while exploring
how we can, together with colleagues from other locations, join in
addressing the need for new ways of documenting the results of
collaborative programs for teachers and students and their schools.
<p>
Third­and undoubtedly obvious to all of us who are convinced that
such collaborative programs are indispensable to improving teaching and
learning in schools­the scale of present efforts is seriously
inadequate when compared with the scope of educational problems
nationally. As one of the Chief State School Officers attending the 1983
conference, Craig Phillips, remarked at that time, the challenge is a vast
undertaking when one contemplates the numbers of teachers and schools in
the United States.
</p><p>
So, as we in New Haven take stock of our own work and of what the
conference revealed about our colleagues' efforts elsewhere­and as we
consider the Institute's role in the future­we want to explore what
new forms of assistance we can offer in at least three areas: namely, a
programmatic emphasis at once on the preparation of both teachers and
curricula; the development of deeper and even more persuasive forms of
evaluation; and a further increase in the number of colleges and
universities and schools with systematic and long­term collaborative
programs designed to strengthen teaching and learning in public schools.
</p><p>
The conference therefore leaves participants from New Haven with a strong
impression not only of the value of having organized the meeting­and
a renewed appreciation of all of our colleagues who took the time to
attend­ but also a clearer recognition of the opportunities and
reasons that now exist for increased collaboration among those involved in
this work at locations across the country.
