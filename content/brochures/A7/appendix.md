<h3> Questionnaire Results</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
Questionnaires dealing with reactions to the conference were sent to all
participants. There were 51 respondents, from 22 of the 27 programs in
attendance. These respondents included 17 school teachers, 10 school
administrators, 10 university faculty, 7 university administrators, and 7
other program representatives.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Of the 51 respondents, 37 were visitors to New Haven and 14 were from the
Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute. On many questions, these two
groups were quite similar in their range of opinion. In a few instances,
which are noted below, the views of some from New Haven were significantly
different from those of visitors.
</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>
<h4>I. The Conference Itself</h4>
</td></tr><tr><td><i>A. Please describe your reactions to the conference­both
the topics and the schedule for the discussions­and whatever general
observations you may care to make about the meeting.
</i></td></tr><tr><td>The great majority of the respondents said explicitly that the
conference was valuable, excellent, invigorating, extremely beneficial, or
of great interest. Many added that the topics were diverse, well chosen
and pertinent. And a good many of those also felt that the schedule was
fine. There were a number of comments in appreciation of the diversity of
groups and persons in attendance. Several expressed their enjoyment
especially of the plenary sessions. One thought the session on "Present
and Potential Sources of Public and Private Support" especially helpful. A
university faculty member said, "In short, I loved the first half day,
especially how well you featured the teachers and their obvious enthusiasm
for the program." A school administrator summed up the views of many: "The
program was well organized and highly stimulating. The diversity was
fantastic. I have become a part of a bigger network. The initial
presentation by the New Haven teachers group was excellent! I also found
it interesting that the DeWitt Wallace­Reader's Digest representative
was there for the program.  This signifies another level of commitment!"
</td><td><hr/><i>The great majority of the respondents said explicitly that the

</i></td></tr><tr><td><i> (figure available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td>Reservations about the conference and suggestions for improvement
covered a wide gamut. Several people felt that some sessions were too
large for meaningful interchange; others would welcome more time for
informal brainstorming. There were suggestions for small­group
meetings, more time spent introducing a variety of programs, a session
addressing the specific organization of at least three collaboratives,
demonstration sessions by various programs, more topics that addressed
middle schools, and even more involvement in the conference by public
school teachers. One respondent was disturbed by the relative lack of
community college people at the conference. And several expressed the view
that the simultaneous sessions posed difficult choices.
</td><td><hr/><i>Several expressed the view that the simultaneous sessions posed

<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>No doubt many of these opinions are somewhat at odds with each
other. But the responses as a whole do seem to suggest that the planners
of any future conference should make yet greater efforts to obtain
preliminary proposals from teachers as well as administrators in the
participating programs, that perhaps the planning might well be carried
out by a group of programs in concert, and that the schedule and physical
arrangements should be as conducive as possible to a variety of
small­group conversations as well as affording the opportunity for
plenary sessions.
</td></tr><tr><td><i>B. What application, if any, do you foresee that the conference
may have on the ongoing development of your own work?
</i></td></tr><tr><td>A good many respondents spoke of the gaining of valuable contacts
with people and projects, the learning of new perspectives, the discovery
of important resources. A university administrator and a university
faculty member said: "We have already used some suggestions on greater
teacher involvement as we plan for next year. We will also try desktop
publishing of course­development curricular materials." Another
university faculty member said: "The only frustration that I am left with
is the lack of time to pursue all of the sources for funding, gathering
guest speakers, etc., in order to improve our current endeavors. The
Institute provided me with materials, ideas, and inspiration that will
keep me busy for years." A school teacher said: "The conference inspired
me to try new classroom curriculum." And another teacher noted:
"Interactions with teams that had similar needs and characteristics;
contacts with individuals across the country; follow­up visitations
between specific teams." Yet another said: "I will use (and have used)
many of the ideas in the green book and from the conference." And yet
another said: "As a result of listening to descriptions of several writing
projects I hope to be part of creating one for our area." And a school
administrator said: "The publication of units developed at the Institute
has been shared with many participants in our project and has generated
discussion about the value of such a document. The publication has also
elicited a great deal of interest about particular units since those
included were so extensive and well­documented. A project with the
American Association of Learned Societies, to be conducted at UCLA with
LAUSD humanities teachers, will undoubtedly use the Institute's curriculum
publication as a resource for its curricular project."
</td></tr><tr><td><i>(figure available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td>Some other respondents felt that it was still too early to
determine the possible application of what they had learned. A school
administrator said: "I will consult with college members of my team for
possibilities. The most obvious is preservice programs for prospective
teachers. Also seeking community and business contacts for future
programs. United Technologies speaker was particularly enlightening."
Another school administrator said the applicability is "limited since we
are involved in a system­wide collaboration of all New York City high
schools and colleges." Yet another was mainly led to reflect upon the need
to challenge the social status quo in order to bring about improvement in
teaching. And a university administrator said: "Frankly, the conference
provided little of practical value.  I met some very pleasant people and
enjoyed the presentations and conversations mostly as evidence of the
state of the art." His perception was that too often traditional
in­service professional development was being called
"university­school collaboration." The few others who could specify
no "practical value" all happened to be New Haven teachers­an
indication, perhaps, that their own perceived needs are already being met
by their participation in the Institute itself.
</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>
<h4>II. Our Possible Collaboration in the Future</h4>
</td></tr><tr><td><i>A. Conferences: Would more conferences be useful? If so, at
what point in the future should they be scheduled and in what ways should
they be similar to, or different from, the 1991 conference?
</i></td></tr><tr><td>Nearly all of the respondents said that more conferences would
indeed be useful. Some thought that annual conferences would be most
desirable; about the same number thought that every two years would be the
optimum interval; and about the same number specified every three years.
</td><td><hr/><i>Nearly all of the respondents said that more conferences would
indeed be useful.<hr/> 
</i></td></tr><tr><td>As the responses to the conference itself suggested, the views on
desirable continuity and change in topic and format were quite diverse.
There were pleas for regional conferences, for fuller presentation of a
variety of partnerships, for workshops on specific practical problems, for
separate tracks for newcomers and those wanting to deal with radical
restructuring of the schools, for fuller information on how to develop new
programs, for more extensive sharing of results. It seems clear that many
respondents would now prefer a more sharply focused conference on a few
issues. But others would not. And the diversity of issues mentioned will
make the planning of a further conference a matter of some complexity.
There were several suggestions that a sharper focus might emerge in
discussions if preliminary statements or "position papers" were provided
by those in charge, with ample lead­time to develop responses. There
were also suggestions that high school students should be brought in for
demonstrations of how certain approaches actually work.
<p>
One way of dealing with this diversity was offered by a school teacher who
said: "I would like to see more conferences scheduled but dealing with
very specific and real educational problems. I think they should be
regional to pull in more people. Then have a national conference to pull
ideas together." And another teacher, thinking along the same lines, said:
"Follow­up of teams within a region, Mid­Atlantic States, summer
or late spring. Keep up the continuity." And a representative from a
professional association said: "Any possibilities for organizing regional
meetings? Sessions as part of other conference programs on collaboration?"
And one team suggested that "we might even establish complementary
collaborative efforts," within some kind of consortium that could clarify
shared purposes, provide for exchange of faculty, and cooperate in
institutes.
</p></td></tr><tr><td><i>B. Publications: What additional types of literature would you
like to see the Institute prepare, and in what ways would this material be
useful to you?</i>
<p>
One school teacher who found the green book "very valuable" asked that it
now be divided into smaller "booklets" according to subject area, and that
more units (especially interdisciplinary ones) be provided. That view was
shared by a university administrator. A program representative asked for
accounts of Yale­New Haven seminars by participants, which might
explore the impact of the seminars on teachers' thinking. A university
faculty member from New Haven urged that the next publication of such
units should be discipline oriented. Teachers from New Haven suggested the
publication of units not only from New Haven but also from other programs.
And indeed there were a number of requests by a variety of respondents for
sample lessons and units developed by other collaboratives, for samples of
program descriptions, for a monograph from each program, for a handbook of
grantsmanship, and for various other kinds of surveys and directories.
The suggestions included material on disk, videos of collaborative
activities, and a clearinghouse of activities for sharing.
</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
<i>C. The Institute has considered planning a series of national seminars
for teachers from other programs with which we have worked. Do you think
that such seminars would be worthwhile? If so, what purposes might they
serve, in what subjects should they be offered, and would you wish to have
a teacher from your own area apply to participate?</i>
</p><p>
A substantial number of respondents from outside New Haven (over twenty)
thought such seminars would be worthwhile, and about half of those
indicated an interest in participation. (A majority of the New Haven
teachers responding also favored the idea.) A few others said that their
interest would depend on the nature of the seminar, or that they could see
only limited benefit.
</p><p>
The suggestions as to subject were various­covering the full range of
humanities, social studies, and mathematics and sciences. Several people
emphasized the desirability of interdisciplinary subject­matter or
very broad topics, and others stressed the need for emphasis upon our
multi­ cultural society. One university administrator suggested that
such seminars be scheduled at different times for different groups
(7­9; 9­12; community college; 4­year college). Another
university administrator said: "I assume you have in mind seminars like
your existing series, with recruitment reaching beyond the New Haven area.
That would be a fine project." One of the teams said: "I love the idea of
a national seminar, but I'm still thinking collaboratively. Why not invite
faculty from the institutes to help plan and teach in this event?" A
school administrator suggested a session of regional programs. And a
representative from ACLS noted that that organization is proposing a
similar initiative in the humanities, with which any Yale effort might be
coordinated.
</p><p>
<i>D. What other forms of collaboration among the participants in the 1991
conference, and with other colleagues, would be worthwhile?</i>
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>Twelve respondents suggested some kind of continuing
organization.
One school administrator said: "A formal organization that is capable of
getting some attention and generating some interest in such collaborations
would be helpful. Since it appears that university people have very little
incentive, aside from their own good intentions (which, by the way, were
very well demonstrated by the Yale faculty), to participate in such
ventures, anything that can be done to make collaborations with school
districts more attractive would be most welcome. If a high profile
university, like Yale, were to lead the way in finding some means for
making collaboration a meaningful step in professors' evaluations, school
districts might find it much easier to sustain partnerships."
</td><td><hr/><i>Twelve respondents suggested some kind of continuing
organization. 
<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td>Ten respondents suggested a newsletter as a main activity of such
an organization. Eleven suggested some kind of electronic billboard. There
were also various requests for information about each collaborative, for a
central library of materials, for computer networking, and for fuller
discussion of the political implications on a national level of the
collaborative movement.
</td></tr><tr></tr><tr><td>
<h4>III. Conference Material</h4>
<i>Please describe the usefulness to you of each of the following
documents, before, during, and after the conference.</i>
<p>
<i>A. Teaching in New Haven: The Common Challenge</i>
</p><p>
Some positive comments on this "green book" were included in answers
reported above. In response to this question, some ten persons described
the volume as good, informative, or very useful. Another seven described
it in yet more laudatory terms as "great," "Impressive," "terrific."
Several spoke of already passing on the volume to others who might make
use of it. One university administrator said: "Interesting ideas and well
put together­well written. My copy is now in the Langley High School
library, where the teachers will have access to it."
</p></td></tr><tr><td>
Six respondents found the book useful primarily in learning about the
Yale­ New Haven program. "It was my introduction," said one
university faculty member, "to the whole notion of how one community
effectively worked together. I read it before arriving at the conference
and knew I would reap numerous benefits from all of your people­and I
did." Three others spoke of it as "interesting but not helpful." Some
suggested that it was especially useful in the area of language and
literature; one called it uneven in quality; and several, despite the
detailed outline of the seminar process in the introduction, received the
erroneous impression that the chief goal of this program is producing
curriculum units. A school administrator said, "In general, we as teachers
in New York State don't need any additional curricula! New York is a
curriculum adoption state and teachers don't have that choice. We need
innovative activities, doable in our time constraints and budget
constraints that teach the concepts required in an interesting way." Here
again there seems to have been some misunderstanding of the purpose of
this volume, which was not to provide curricula but to exemplify a
process, and some misunderstanding of the process itself, which certainly
accommodates innovative activities that teach required concepts.
</td><td><hr/><i>"It was my introduction to the whole notion of how one
community
effectively worked together. "
<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td><i>(figure available in print form)</i>
<p>
<i> B. "Progress Report on Surveys Administered to New Haven Teachers,
1982­ 1990"</i>
</p></td></tr><tr><td>
A dozen or so respondents found this report interesting and informative.
One school administrator found it difficult to assess, because of too much
"soft" data. Another school administrator wanted to hear more about the
surveys. A university faculty member said: "Helpful to see concrete
evidence of improvement. The sense of improvement seems to me the most
convincing, but there are those who look for statistical evidence. Such
reports therefore are helpful and welcome." And a team said: "Our own
participants write letters of evaluation. When we present them to
corporations, etc., we are often admonished to get figures­even
though the participants' letters clearly demonstrate the effect of the
program on their philosophy and mode of teaching. Your survey format
allows for impressive figures."
</td><td><hr/><i>"Your survey format allows for impressive figures."<hr/>
</i></td></tr><tr><td><i>(figure available in print form)
</i></td></tr><tr><td><i>C. "Issues for Discussion" at the conference prepared from
advance response of those who would attend.</i>
<p>
Between fifteen and twenty people described this document as informative
and helpful. Another six complained that they could not always see
connections between this document and the actual sessions. One team liked
the fact that discussion leaders did not feel bound to adhere to the
printed items. Several people found the document a useful tool for
critical thinking.  And one person complained that the people filling out
the advance questionnaires on which the document was based were often not
teachers but administrators.
</p><p>
<i>D. "Directory of Programs" represented at the conference, compiled from
material provided by the programs themselves.</i>
</p><p>
There was an overwhelmingly positive response to this directory, but
little detailed comment. One person suggested the addition of specific
addresses and zip codes. Others wanted yet fuller accounts of the programs
than were offered.
</p>
<h4>IV. Please add anything you want us to consider in preparing a report
or planning for the future.</h4>
</td></tr><tr><td>
Here again the answers were quite various, and those from the school
teachers often overlapped issues already summarized under earlier
categories. A program representative noted that the conference had never
addressed "how teachers' understanding of knowledge (and of a particular
discipline) changed by the experience of participating in one of the Yale
seminars." A school administrator suggested "the infusion of some
university people working on learning theory and research." A university
faculty member was especially struck by the discussion on
principals­"excellent principals who trust teachers vs. the
suggestion of schools with no principals"­and suggested this as an
issue to explore. "I'd also be interested to know more," he said, "about
how the Sizer program could become involved in these discussions. And how
(if at all) we might respond to the new book by Kozol." A university
administrator suggested the need for lots of work on "global
issues"­"Where are we in 2010? in 2020?" A university faculty member
said, "I see these collaborative ventures as moving from a university
centered (trickle­down theory of knowing) to one which is more truly
a matter of mutual exploration and cooperation." A university
administrator testified to the importance of a "chain of life" linking
programs that had evolved from James Vivian's instigation. And another
faculty member said: "Please create some method for us to stay in touch.
There are so many wonderful creative programs­let's share."
