Recent debates about American culture have been waged in sharply
dichotomous terms: whether we are fundamentally unified or fundamentally
diverse, a "melting-pot"or a multi-cultural "mosaic." During the past
decade, conservative critics have lamented the absence of cultural unity
and have advocated, as a supposed remedy for this absence, that our public
schools teach a nationalized "core curriculumS of great books that
illuminate superior values. This call to intellectual arms has attracted
considerable popular attention. In 1987 two books espousing related
versions of this theme became national best-sellers: <i>Cultural
Literacy</i>, by E. D. Hirsch of the University of Virginia, and <i>The
Closing of the American Mind</i> by Allan Bloom of the University of
Chicago; and political leaders prominent in the Reagan and Bush
administrations were quick to embrace this theme and their professorial
exponents.
Toni Marie Massaro, a professor of law at the University of Arizona, gives
a paradoxical spin to this debate. There should be a core national
curriculum, Massaro asserts, but it should not purport to promote unified
cultural values; the core curriculum should instead "teach the conflictsS
Q that is, it should identify the persistent tensions between unity and
diversity in American cultural life and should offer students a coherent
intellectual framework for thinking about these tensions without insisting
that they choose one side over the other. Massaro proposes that
instruction in constitutional law would be the best vehicle for providing
a specifically focused content to this curriculum.
<p>
In the first part of her book, Massaro sets the contemporary debate into
the context of educational controversies that have raged for at least a
hundred years in this country Q the "competing pulls," as she puts it, "of
common culturalism and multiculturalism [that] have caused educational
policies to swing toward and away from the poles of strong, national
assimilation and strong, local pluralismS (p. 22). At the end of this
survey, Massaro concludes that "any national core curriculum must reflect
both the core curricularists' interest in cultural solidarity and their
critics' interest in cultural pluralism, because both interests are
integral to our national constitutional character "(p. 65).
</p><p>
In the second part of her book, Massaro suggests the way that teaching
constitutional law, at varying levels of sophistication and complexity
from sixth grade upwards, could accomplish this curricular integration of
the competing themes of unity and diversity. Massaro maintains that
constitutional law is a good, and even a preferable, curricular instrument
because Americans historically have tended to define themselves in its
terminology. She correctly observes that public debates on issues of unity
vs. diversity "typically occur against the backdrop of our constitutional
commitments­ using constitutional language as our common
vocabularyS­ in matters such as secularism vs. religious expression
in public institutions, unrestrained vs. restricted expression in the
media and other public forums, and claims regarding use vs. misuse of
race, gender, disability or sexual identity categorizations (p. 70).
</p><p>
Massaro's discussion of specific Supreme Court decisions addressing these
various matters is the most useful part of her book. She presents these
decisions clearly and accessibly for lay readers, and in doing so, she
demonstrates the feasibility of her claim that classroom discussions of
constitutional law can serve the educational purposes that she has
proposed. At the same time, however, Massaro's specific case discussions
underscore the difficulty in achieving her proclaimed goal of merely
"teaching the conflicts" without pushing students toward some
pedagogically preferred resolution of these conflicts. Massaro works hard
to be scrupulously fair-minded in her presentations, and attentive to the
complexity of the competing social goals in controversies such as public
support for religious preferences in educational institutions or school
censorship of student speech or claims for racial- or gender-based
affirmative action policies in educational institutions. But Massaro has a
clear ideological commitment in these matters­ a complex, even
paradoxical conviction that constitutional doctrine should give
essentially equal respect to the "competing parts of the American
personality: a liberal instinct to permit dissent and escape from common
standards [and] an assimilationist instinct to enforce common standards"
(p. 101).
</p><p>
This position mirrors Massaro's pedagogic commitment to teaching rather
than resolving these conflicts. In substantive constitutional law, this
position leads Massaro to prefer some Supreme Court decisions to others;
thus, in discussing recent cases that uphold school censorship of student
speech and newspapers, Massaro sharply observes that the "current Court,
led by the statism of Justice Scalia, seems profoundly unconcerned about
protecting the liberal instinct from overweening assimilationist forces"
(p. 101). However persuasive this criticism might be, it would not sit
comfortably within the non-directive pedagogy that Massaro appears to
espouse in her core curriculum design.
</p><p>
But Massaro is not guilty of inconsistency here. There is a deeper
consistency in her own thinking that she does not adequately acknowledge.
The deeper consistency is that, from her perspective, the Supreme Court is
obliged to teach the same lesson to the nation at large that she proposes
for its school curriculum­ the lesson that equal respect is required
for the demands both of diversity and of unity in our culture. Maintaining
balance between these contradictory impulses is itself a substantive
position which is both difficult to accomplish and inevitably
controversial in its specific, practical applications. Accordingly,
Massaro's proposed curriculum is not, as the first part of her book might
appear to suggest, a non-judgmental middle ground between the contemporary
avatars of cultural unity and diversity. There is no escape from making
value judgments on these matters, whether in deciding court cases or
designing curricula.
</p><p>
By the end of her book, Massaro admits as much, and she explicitly
justifies her proposal to "teach the conflicts" as a way of giving
heightened visibility to multicultural perspectives which­ as she
views the present moment­ are threatened with suppression by the most
vocal contemporary proponents for a national core curriculum. I myself am
persuaded of the virtue of Massaro's proposed curriculum. But it does not
strengthen her case to deny that, in our current mood of "culture clash,"
many triumphalist advocates will disagree.
