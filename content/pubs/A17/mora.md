Fragmented School Reform and Effective Partnerships</h2>
<font size="+1">By Carlos Mora</font>
</center><hr/>
Schools have been victimized by a multitude of well-meaning
individuals, agencies and foundations­ each inspired by a private
view of
education reform or school improvement. School reform programs may not be
compatible and thus may pull teachers and students in different
directions. The observation that teachers are overwhelmed by
multiple­
and many times incompatible­reform efforts is not new. Tyack and
Tobin
(1994) quote a New York teacher from the 1940s who, referring to a reform
of that time, said: "Last year it was the socialization recitation, or the
Gary Plan, or dramatization, or correlation; this year it is motivation,
silent reading, or the Dalton Plan. Each is taken up in turn,
indiscriminately adopted, presently elbowed out to make room for the next
newcomer; and yet we are not saved. The old problems remain."
<p>
The Federal Government is aware of the dangers of fragmented reform
efforts.  In a recent report, the U.S. Department of EducationUs Office of
Educational Research and Improvement Program (OERI) warns that their
conjoint efforts with the National Science Foundation "must not fragment
Federal reform efforts through the creation of a multitude of Tsystemic
reform' activities.  All resources going to a state should be focused on
support for a single, comprehensive strategy to attain the National
Education Goals."In an article written for the inaugural issue of <i>On
Common Ground</i>, Secretary of Education Riley asserts that fragmentation
is also present in staff development activities.  "Too frequently,
professional development activities have been Tone shot,U offer limited
follow up, and are isolated from school and district goals.  This has been
true of many federally funded professional development activities as
well."
</p><p>
Due to the sources of funding, urban schools are more vulnerable to the
onslaught of uncoordinated reform than rural or suburban schools. For
example, New Haven schools receive close to 87 percent of their funding
from external sources while only 13 percent is raised from local sources.
The 1995-96 New Haven schools budget includes $20 million in grants and
$101 million in state aid, while local revenues amount to $23 million.
The grant money supports 135 different programs, covering a wide area of
subjects from curriculum-based (e.g., improving math and science education
through systemic change), to community-based (e.g., adult education for
the homeless). Each one of those grants embodies a preferred mode of
school reform, including priorities, reporting requirements, professional
development, classroom activities, and so forth. A wealthy suburban
district receives less money from outside sources, but at the same time is
burdened with fewer mandates.
</p><p>Uncoordinated efforts create a climate incompatible with organizational
goals. The lack of consistency in action and unity in purpose creates
frequent opportunities for conflicts, misunderstandings, and antagonisms.
Teachers and administrators in schools become less productive because part
of their time and energy is spent resolving conflicts or clarifying
misunderstandings. An obvious response would be to coordinate the reform
efforts. In fact, this has been recommended by several observers,
including the federal government. As quoted above, OERI suggested that the
grants­at least theirs­should support a "single, comprehensive
strategy." But it is difficult to bring the current situation into a house
of order.
Why is it so difficult to coordinate reform efforts? Obviously, the
complexity of the education system makes coordination difficult. But that
argument is not sufficient, since many other complex systems exhibit good
coordination.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, we do not have a general theory of education, powerful
enough to cover several areas including learning, teaching and school
administration; instead, we have short-range "theories"­or fields of
inquiry Q­that illuminate a limited area but are not sufficient to
establish connections with other areas. A general theory of education
would yield two immediate benefits: (a) it would filter out reform plans
incompatible with the theory, (b) it would make clear how the different
areas are connected, thus facilitating the consistency and unity of
reforms.
</p><p>
The absence of a general theory may be a transitory or a permanent feature
of our capacity to understand complex social systems. Maybe one day it
will be developed. In the meantime, we have isolated areas of inquiry, but
this is no different from the historical development of science. The
eminent physicist Victor Weisskopf (1977) noted that scientific inquiry
began by asking limited questions. "Instead of searching for the whole
truth, people began to examine definable and clearly separable phenomena.
They asked not What is matter? and What is life? but How does blood flow
in the blood vessels? . . . In time this restraint was rewarded as the
answers to limited questions became more and more general."
</p><p>
Two promising fields of inquiry in education are empowerment and
accountability. Empowerment has been a popular component of many
organizational transformation programs implemented over the last decade by
business and industry in the Western world. The goal of empowerment is to
bring first-line managers and employees closer to the decision-making
process.  The strategy seems to be working.
</p><p>
Numerous studies in the business literature document a strong relationship
between increases in productivity and quality on the one hand, and
increased workers' empowerment. In education, the goal of empowerment is
to move to the school building most of the decision making power
previously assigned to the central office.  It also seems to be a winning
strategy for schools (cf. "The Milwaukee Experiment," <i>Business
Week</i>, April 17, 1995).
</p><p>
For over a decade now, the New Haven schools have experimented with a very
effective model of empowerment: the Comer model. The Comer model is
predicated on a school-based organization called the School Planning and
Management Team (SPMT). The SPMTs are organized around psychological and
academic needs of the school community. However, the fact that at the
present time the SPMT does not have a budget for operations limits the
extent of empowerment.
</p><p>
Another example of empowerment is provided by the Yale-New Haven Teacher
Institute. The Institute is a teacher-based program that offers both
resources and training for teachers to express their contributions to
curriculum development. The productivity of the Institute, as measured by
the quality and quantity of curriculum units developed over the years, is
a testimonial of its effectiveness. At the present time the Institute is
developing a database of curriculum units developed by fellow New Haven
teachers. The intent is to make the database available through the
Internet and train teachers so that they are able to use this vast
resource.
</p><p>
The effectiveness of empowerment is a reflection of the quality of
decisions made by teachers and school administrators who have had neither
training nor experience as decision makers before.  What decision tools
should be available to them in order to discharge their new
responsibilities with a fair probability of success? Although we don't
have a definite answer to that question yet, it is possible to identify
some basic tools that need close attention.
</p><p>
<i> Database of available resources</i>. This may include curriculum
materials, training programs, assessment kits, student enrichment
activities, university and/or business partnerships, and so forth. The
database should identify basic attributes of the resource such as cost,
source, availability, training requirements, duration, and references.
</p><p>
<i> Selection criteria</i>. This may include a voting system, a checklist
of minimum requirements, a plan for resource utilization, or a combination
of these and other selection criteria.
</p><p>
<i> Budgeting and resource allocation</i>.  This will include a diagnosis
of the current slack in human and material resources.
</p><p>
<i>Program implementation and monitoring</i>.  This will be covered under
constructive accountability.
</p><p>
Accountability is another popular topic in the current debate over school
reform.  The American public is concerned with the cost and quality of
public education and that concern is being expressed in the political
arena.  Legislation calling for standardized testing, minimum graduation
requirements, endorsed diplomas, teacher certification, school report
cards, and district profiles has been adopted by most states.
</p><p>
Operationally, accountability is based on measurement models that define
the object of accountability.  For example, interest in student outcomes
leads to the development of standardized tests or other measures of
student performance. Information systems are needed to collect and analyze
measurement data and disseminate results. The informational infrastructure
created by the measurement models and information systems could be used to
convey a constructive facet to accountability. Constructive accountability
must be based on a model of information utilization for early detection of
problems, timely suggestions for improvement, participatory decision
making, and consistent recognition of good performance.
</p><p>
An example of university-school partnership forged around constructive
accountability is voluntary accreditation. In 1871, The University of
Michigan initiated a program of school accreditation whose original
purpose was to "examine" schools instead of individual applicants.
Applicants who graduated from accredited schools were granted admission
without further tests.  That created a great incentive for local schools
to become accredited and Michigan began receiving correspondence from
schools interested in its accreditation program. A few years later James
Angell, then President of The University of Michigan, hosted a meeting of
presidents of midwest universities interested in the accreditation
program. That meeting resulted in the foundation of the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA), a regional accreditation
association that expanded over the years and today includes nineteen
states plus the Navajo Nation and the Department of Defense dependent
schools.
</p><p>
In spite of the fact that the automatic admission status granted to
otherwise qualified applicants from accredited schools has been
eliminated, schools continue to express great interest in voluntary
accreditation. Today, the accreditation process is based on a set of
minimum standards or indicators of total school quality.  The
accreditation process generates data which can be used (and in fact is
typically used) for school improvement.
</p><p>
Although the public at large may only be interested in a pass/fail
verdict, universities can help schools further develop the informational
infrastructure of accountability systems so that the information can be
used to inform decisions in the context of school improvement. This
possibility is not restricted to school accreditation. Student
achievement, teacher certification and re-certification, graduation
requirements and the like, are all examples of accountability objects that
can be treated in a similar manner.
</p><p>
We hope that with the information provided by a system of constructive
accountability and the power needed to make decisions based on that
information, school-based organizations like SPMTs will be able to impart
order to the many reform programs and make sure that their energies
converge at all those points where teaching meets learning.
