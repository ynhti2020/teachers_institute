<h3> Science Kits as Instruction Tools<br/>
By Sharon Olguin</h3>
Across the country many school districts have moved toward the adoption of
science kits as an approach for teaching science. Implementation of
science kits as tools for instruction is seen as a means for more
inclusion of science in the curriculum. The issue of science kits for
instructional purposes was a focus for discussion at a recent board
meeting for On Common Ground. The group shared a common belief about the
importance of science instruction and children's natural curiosity about
their world. Discussion, however, was centered around the ways in which
science kits are being developed and implemented.
<p>
Children are instinctively curious and always on a quest for finding
answers to their questions. Given that they naturally want to learn, it is
my belief that the elementary classroom is the obvious place to introduce
the scientific processes that will help them understand their world. This
is a philosophical belief that I hold to be important. However, my
experiences have led me to some conclusions that differ with those
expressed in the article, "Educating Students for the 21st Century,"
written by Bruce M. Roberts and Jan Tuomi. Science kits have been adopted
by many of the schools in the Albuquerque Public School district where I
am employed. They are often seen as replacement for the science
curriculum. The kits are designed to teach a particular concept and are
provisioned with the necessary materials for implementation. As a way of
facilitating implementation, the kits are also delivered to the classroom
teacher's door. The teacher simply has to use the kit to teach science.
For many teachers this ready-made curriculum is the only way their
students will be exposed to science concepts. They embrace the idea
willingly and allow someone else to assume the responsibility for science
instruction. The materials are simply placed in the room and children are
given time to explore them.
</p><p>
All too often this is believed to be science instruction. The children's
natural curiosity and innate interest in science leads them to explore the
materials and come to some understandings. The teacher is comfortable that
science is being taught and is released from the responsibility of
developing a broader understanding of science as a discipline.
</p><p>
This approach raises many questions. I will address some of them here. It
is true that science kits offer opportunities for hands-on experiences;
frequently, however, there is no connection made to their relevance in the
bigger scheme of children's experiences. Attention is not paid to the
development of science concepts or to the processes necessary to solve
problems systematically using the scientific process. This lack of
connectedness means that the learner may have had a fun experience but
quickly moves on to something new. Each event occurs in isolation.
</p><p>
The teacher, assuming the kit will do the teaching, has no investment in
furthering the learner's understanding. This is especially true if the
teacher has not developed knowledge about the concept being presented in
the kit. Adopting this approach means that the teacher has no
responsibility to continued learning. Science instruction, although no
longer presented as the memorization of scientific terms, has been reduced
to its simplest form.
</p><p>
This style of instruction appears to be based on ease of gathering and
convenience of storing materials. Complexity of the materials is therefore
compromised. If the teacher does nothing to enhance the kit's
implementation with additional materials and resources, the children fail
to develop the skills necessary for becoming problem solvers and critical
evaluators. Their thinking maintains itself at the comprehension level.
This certainly moves us no closer to reaching the standards set forth in
the Goals 2000 legislation.
</p><p>
An additional concern is the financial cost for developing kits. Most of
the supplies included with the kits are consumable and fairly expensive,
and the cost of the kits to the schools is inflated in order to pay
someone to purchase, compile, replenish, store (in some situations) and
distribute the kits. This additional expense reduces the dollar amount
that could have been spent on the purchase of non-consumable items. When
purchased, non-consumable items such as books, microscopes, flasks,
dissecting tools, etc., become available for all children to use in the
future. A yearly addition of further resources for science instruction
could prove more beneficial and move the learner and teacher to a more
complex understanding of science as a discipline.
</p><p>
I agree that an experiential approach to science instruction begun in the
elementary classroom is necessary. As teachers we can also take advantage
of the notion that children are natural scientists and have it serve as an
invitation to develop a rich environment for science instruction.
</p><p>
I question the practice of using science kits in isolation because they
assume that the teacher has neither knowledge of the content nor desire to
become more informed. It leads me to wonder: if the responsibility for
replenishing kits were returned to teachers, would their use serve as a
model for expanding science and making it an integral part of the
curriculum, or would science instruction again receive less emphasis?

<h3> A Central Role for Science Education Partnerships<br/>
By Eloy Rodriguez</h3>
I want to add a number of conclusions about effective science education
partnerships to the excellent article by Bruce M. Alberts and Jan Tuomi.
The conclusions derive from my very rewarding experience establishing the
"Kids Investigating and Discovering Science" (KIDS) program at the
University of California, Irvine (UCI).
<p>
I targeted the Santa Ana Unified School District which has an enrollment
of over 49,000 students of whom 92 percent are minority and 64 percent are
limited-English proficient   the greatest concentration of such students
in California.
</p><p>
With colleagues at UCI, I began the KIDS program five years ago to provide
Latino children from low-income families with an engaging and challenging
university-based science "camp." The focus of the program was
project-based learning on topics at the forefront of biology, especially
field biology. We wanted the children to be able to actually believe
themselves to be young scientists. They wore white laboratory coats and
worked side-by-side with teachers, research faculty, undergraduate and
graduate students. In this respect, this was truly an intergenerational
model of teaching and learning. We made our laboratories and field
research sites places where children from kindergarten through middle
school could discover and investigate the mysteries of science. The campus
became a place in which low-income children could pose, investigate and
answer fundamental questions on such topics as function, adaptation,
evolution, gravity, sound, inertia, force, velocity and acceleration in an
environmental framework with enthusiastic parents, compassionate student
assistants and gifted bilingual teachers from the school district.
Bilingualism was crucial for the success of this program since the
majority of KIDS students and parents only spoke Spanish.
</p><p>
But the true partnership was that of the KIDS program and the parents.
This belief sprung from my own experience. My educational success in a
poor south Texas school was largely due to my mother's active involvement
in PTA and teacher/parent conferences. Therefore, the program emphasized
and insisted that parents be made participatory partners in this unique
endeavor.
</p><p>
University faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, parents, teachers
and principals all consider KIDS to be a great success. Evaluation data
show this to be true. We have seen that a partnership between the campus
and K-12 schools can enable minority children to experience the joy and
excitement of science and can have an enormous impact on the children's
learning and interest in science. A clear indicator of success was the
students' improvement in their grades at their "normal" school (a term
students used to separate KIDS-UCI from their school) and comments from
the parents indicating that the students were more involved in their
studies.
</p><p>
Our basic goal for the KIDS program has been to foster the development of
a generation of youngsters who learn to think and understand the
importance of education in order to go to college and pursue a career in
the sciences. KIDS is a year round science partnership between UCI and the
Santa Ana Unified School District. In the summer, children from the Santa
Ana schools come to the campus where they become part of a research
university. The effects of this approach have been profound. Outstanding
Santa Ana teachers who have worked with us in designing and carrying out
the program are the children's teachers during the academic year. They
tell us such things as "The KIDS students . . . value learning about
science and see it as very important, fun and challenging" . . . "Both
boys and girls have begun to see themselves as scientists" . . . "I am
constantly confronted by the KIDS students with their question of 'when
can we go to UCI to study more science?'"
</p><p>
Distinguished minority faculty serve as role models and mentors to the
school children and to minority graduate and undergraduate students who
work alongside K-12 teachers in the program. The KIDS children typically
have their first minority scientist role models in the University faculty
and students. Faculty visit the children's schools during the academic
year, and undergraduates serve as tutors at KIDS schools, continuing to
serve as significant role models.
</p><p>
I also want to re-emphasize the critical importance of parents as
partners. Parents serve as volunteer homework mentors and others are paid
to assist in teaching, mentoring and to serve as staff. Parent programs
are offered at school sites in the community daily after the summer camp
ends. The activities strengthen parents' skills in supporting their
children's learning. Principals at the children's schools tell us that,
"These have become some of our most active parents at school. They are
eager to share their hopes and their plans for their students to attend
college. . . . Most of our KIDS parents are participating in our Parent
Institute for Quality Education."
</p><p>
Finally, I want to underscore the value of building on an existing
regional infrastructure that has solid community support, if one exists.
An important factor contributing to the rapid and continuing success of
KIDS is that it has been implemented in conjunction with the
Student/Teacher Education Partnership (STEP). This is a collaborative
effort involving the predominantly minority Santa Ana School District
the largest in Orange County   and other institutions of higher education
and school districts in the region. STEP, which has been in existence for
close to fifteen years, is nationally recognized as a model of
school-college collaboration. It has had support at the highest levels,
including UCI's Chancellor and the Santa Ana Unified School District's
Superintendent.
</p><p>
Notable effects of the KIDS science partnership have occurred in the
children's school-year experiences. Teachers tell us, "Many of the KIDS
students have become the 'leaders' in their classrooms in the area of
science and problem solving." Principals tell us, "Due to the fact that
four of our teachers have been KIDS teachers we've been 'infected' with
KIDS philosophy and focus on inquiry." It can and does work school-wide
across all areas of the curriculum.
</p><p>
I urge colleagues at other colleges and universities to collaborate with
school districts in creating similar programs enabling children to
participate in the campus scientific life. In these partnerships, the
campus becomes a truly common ground for fostering the love and learning
of science.
