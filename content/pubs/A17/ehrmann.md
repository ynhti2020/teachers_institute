A Partnership Supporting Computers in the Schools: Lessons From
Portugal</h2>
<p><font size="+1">By Stephen C. Ehrmann</font>
</p></center><hr/>
Reform efforts in large, rich nations can be splintered into competing
camps, each with an issue, constituency, and not enough money. Perhaps we
should look to smaller, poorer nations if we want to learn about
creativity, cost-effectiveness, and truly effective partnerships. I was
recently privileged to be the United States representative in a team of
four evaluators invited by Portugal and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) to assess a recently concluded
Portuguese program called Project Minerva. Minerva's purpose was to
foster broader use of computing in Portuguese schools. The project had
lasted seven good years. Portugal was bringing it to a close, taking
stock, and thinking about what to do next.
<p>
Minerva was a college-school-government partnership, initiated by  college
faculty, funded by an equally imaginative government agency, and  staffed
largely by school teachers. Its goal was to get computers into  the
schools and, far more important, to help teachers improve formal and
informal learning by exploiting the new machines.
</p><p>
To give you a taste of Minerva's achievement, here's one case of many
that we included in our report.<font size="-1"><b>1</b></font>
</p><p>
The coordinator of a computer center serving several rural Portuguese
schools told our team, "Last year one school did a project on 'How did
our grandparents live?' They collected all kinds of information,
including recipes about what their grandparents ate. One of the boys
said, 'We have so many recipes, we can do a cookbook!' Alentej has a  very
distinctive cooking style, but there has never been a cookbook  about the
cooking of this region. Our book will be produced next June,  and
distributed by schools all over Portugal. The children are now in a
different school but they come back to our center regularly and ask  about
their book. When it is published, there will be a party. The boys  will
wear ties, and the girls will wear their smart dresses. The  children were
9 and 10 years old, and they will have written something  people all over
Portugal will read."
</p><p>
This anecdote illustrates several features of Minerva   the role of the
computer in enabling a broader pattern of curricular change (desktop
publishing enabled but did not encompass this exciting project),
collaboration and sharing of resources, and the reforming power of the
children's own energy drawn from their encounter with the world outside
the school. Several features of Minerva are not apparent from the story,
however, among them the roles of the university, school, and  governmental
partners.
</p><p>
The design of Minerva had an elegant geometric simplicity. Visualize a
triangle with the Ministry of Education at one vertex, the universities
at a second, and the schools at the third. Minerva had a distributed
leadership structure: you can turn the triangle so that any vertex is on
top   each of the three partners could be seen as the true leader of
Minerva.
</p><p>
For example, the Ministry of Education provided not only funds but also  a
central point of reference and leadership. Although Minerva was  invented
by university faculty from several institutions who then  approached the
government for funding, and although its first director  was in a
university, its later directors were Ministry officials. The  Ministry
allocated ("seconded") teachers to Minerva (all teachers are  paid by the
central government) and also paid the bills for training,  equipment
(including a computer each year for the participating  schools),
university staff, publications, and other expenses.
</p><p>
The universities were equally the leaders of Minerva. Each participating
university controlled the use of the resources for its area, and was
responsible for the quality of the operation. Each university selected
its schools (often around fifty of them) from a number of applicants,
and tailored services to their needs and the university's special
capabilities. For example, a university might specialize to a degree in
the development of courseware, while another might specialize in  services
for special education; all universities, however, had to  provide a base
of general services for their schools. In the beginning,  the universities
organized only training courses and support to  teachers. As their staff
of seconded teachers (often around 20 of them)  became more knowledgeable
about computers, they also offered  subject-oriented seminars and other
services.
</p><p>
The schools were equally the leaders of Minerva. At its peak, almost  1200
schools were participating. Their "seconded" teachers shaped and
delivered the services offered by the universities. Some of the key
government officials in the Ministry were themselves seconded teachers.
Also of course the schools decided what ultimately was to be done with
the opportunities created for them by Minerva.
</p><p>
Each group had its own distinctive rewards (i.e., incentives) which
helped to power and stabilize this distributed leadership.
</p><p>
The Ministry could display visible, valuable national leadership.
</p><p>
The universities' education faculty could gain entrance to the schools
for their research. Minerva influenced the in-service and even the
pre-service offerings at a number of universities and colleges. Faculty
from departments other than education could play a role in improving
schooling (and thus the qualifications of students seeking entry to  their
institution) and could develop courseware for use in schools.
</p><p>
The schools had the greatest incentives to lead and collaborate. They
could get computers, extensive training for their teachers, and
opportunities to advance the broader education reform agenda in  Portugal.
The seconded teachers benefited professionally, from what they  learned in
doing their work and, for some, graduate study.
</p><p>
Each university operation (called a "node") and its cluster of schools
was mainly on its own, and appreciated its loose interdependence with  the
other nodes. As one school teacher said of the seconded teacher at a
nearby computer learning center, "If I don't know, I go to Amelia. If
Amelia doesn't know, she goes to [her node]. If [her node] doesn't know,
there are other nodes. There is quite a network, through the computer
bulletin board system, through workshops offered by other nodes." Three
times during Minerva's history there were national meetings. More
frequently contact came in meetings with a defined purpose (e.g.
discussing Logo) that were sponsored by one or more nodes and,  sometimes,
by associations. When one node offered a workshop, sometimes  teachers
from other regions of the country would also attend, especially  if the
workshop dealt with specialized topics. Because of the linchpin  role
played by seconded teachers, and because of the strength and  confidence
that came from a distributed leadership structure in which no  party was
subordinated, Minerva participants could collaborate across  what
traditionally have been almost insurmountable organizational  barriers in
Portugal.
</p><p>
Our team concluded that the distributed leadership structure at the  heart
of Project Minerva was a great success, worthy of close study by  Portugal
and other nations. I think it has some special lessons for the  United
States.
</p><p>
l) Portugal was able to create a national school-college-government
partnership to deal with a serious, long-term educational problem. The
United States has not yet shown itself capable of doing that.
</p><p>
2) Minerva demonstrated that such a partnership could function with a
relatively non-hierarchical, distributed leadership structure, one in
which each of the three major parties could be seen as the leader and  key
driving force behind the whole.
</p><p>
3) Minerva also showed that it is foolish to divide the reform effort
into "technology initiatives" and "normal initiatives."  Minerva was not
a computer literacy project. Computers were the key enabling factor but
the range of benefits ran far beyond the immediate uses of the machines.
For the schools, let the Alentej cookbook stand as the symbol of what
Minerva can accomplish. For the universities, let the enlivening of  their
teachers education programs stand as a symbol of their broader  benefits.
For the government, so recently an autocracy, the triumph was  in
supporting and, in its later years, directing a program that was a  model
of distributed leadership.
</p><p>
In these days when any initiative seems too expensive to a government
agency, a university, or a school, let Portugal stand as a symbol of  what
our poor country might yet accomplish.
