Response to Robert Reich: Collaboration Across the Community College</h2>
<font size="+1">By Carole F. Edmonds</font>
</center><hr/>
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich's article "Creating New Paths to the
Middle Class" in the Fall 1994 issue of <i>On Common Ground</i> calls for
new paths to the middle class and rightly points to community colleges as
institutions uniquely positioned to help Americans reach their career
goals. As Reich notes, community colleges serve Americans of all ages and
backgrounds from those who are over thirty and seeking retraining after
losing a job to traditional-age college students getting the first half of
the courses towards a bachelor's degree to persons with degrees seeking
new directions.
<p>
Linkages with business and industry to insure the appropriateness of
course work and establish cooperative work experiences for students and
collaboration with secondary schools is extensive and on-going at
community colleges across the country. Certainly that is the case at
Kellogg Community College. Collaboration is occurring at every level of
education and among levels. At the community college, however, we need not
only to collaborate with the K-12s and the universities, but also across
the college. My college, like many community colleges, is considered
comprehensive; that is, we offer associate degrees for students planning
to go to work directly after they complete their community college study
and for students who plan to transfer to universities. While faculty seem
to work together across programs of study_certainly nursing students take
composition courses and there is general education in every program足
the linkages are often a mile wide and an inch deep.
</p><p>
Students and faculty often talk about getting general education courses
"out of the way" so they can get to the "real" courses in their specialty
areas of drafting or nursing or computer repair. Furthermore, faculty in
specialty areas usually speak of the humanities, in particular, as being
part of curricula for students planning to transfer to universities and
"nice" if they fit in the occupational curriculum (which they do not
because there are already too many requirements).
</p><p>
For years that is how the discussion went at Kellogg Community College.
Then in 1993, we developed a proposal, funded by the National Endowment
for the Humanities, which brought occupational program faculty and
transfer program faculty together to study primary texts from European
American, African American, Native American and Asian American traditions
and required all participating faculty to integrate the texts in their
courses.
</p><p>
The design of the project was simple: six faculty members足 three who
taught occupational courses (nursing, drafting, and business) and three
who taught liberal arts courses (English, music, and history)足 would
meet together for a semester to read the same texts and discuss them with
each other and with visiting scholars. At the end of the project, they
would produce an annotated bibliography that would be useful to their
colleagues throughout the college and they would integrate some of the
texts they had read into their own courses. During the discussions, they
would focus on the theme of work which would provide a starting point
equally accessible to occupational and liberal arts faculty.
</p><p>
What actually happened was more collaborative and stimulating than any of
us had anticipated or even dared to hope for. First, work was just the
starting point of conversations about the readings that were far ranging
and thoughtful. For instance, in discussing Thoreau's Walden, the drafting
instructor said that he was going to use a passage in his classes which
talked about Thoreau taking the time to spend half a day just looking at
the world outside his door. The instructor commented that students needed
to develop their creativity by looking up from their computer screens and
contemplating possibilities, just staring out the window. Then he asked
the nursing instructor if that was important in nursing, and she said,
"No, there just isn't time." He then described an experience with the
birth of his daughter when there happened to be no other babies born on
that night and the nurse had had time to come in and hold the baby and he
knew she was experiencing the miracle of birth just as he was. The
conversation moved on, but at the next session, the nursing instructor
said that she wanted to share something. She said that she had repeated
the comment about time to celebrate the wonder of life as part of nursing
with her colleagues in the nursing department. They had decided that in
some way they had to be sure their students experienced that joy and
excitement as part of their nursing education.
</p><p>
Other moments of discovery occurred at almost every session, sometimes
induced by the provocative and helpful comments of visiting scholars, such
as Xiao-huang Yin from Harvard University, who opened up a whole world of
Asian American texts, but who charmed the faculty by providing many
practical suggestions about how the texts might be used in
freshman/sophomore level classes, even providing the entire syllabus and
reading list from his courses. His openness and that of the other visiting
university scholars, plus their interest in how our faculty read the texts
and how they saw them as working in their courses built new bridges of
collaboration across types of institutions at the same time that our music
instructor and drafting instructor gained new respect for each other,
coming to anticipate the group's discussions eagerly and stopping each
other in the hall to share information about a new article or book read.
Conversations ranged from the relationship of Toni Morrison's <i>Song of
Solomon</i> to West African religions that opened up new vistas for the
history instructor to the ways Native Americans and African Americans use
design that the drafting instructor planned to incorporate into projects
for his product design students.
</p><p>
Sometimes the moments of sharing were personal, as when an African
American instructor shared the similarities between the experiences
described in Ralph Ellison's<i> Invisible Man</i>  to his own life, right
down to having been offered a scholarship to the same predominantly black
college. Another time, the conversation focused on the description of a
mother's death in a text and the recent death of the mother of one of the
faculty members. All of these conversations could occur in groups that did
not cross the lines of occupational and liberal arts faculty at a
community college; however, because the conversations were both personal
and professional, because they jumped from pedagogy to interpretation to
personal experience, they created a bonding that was both personal and
professional. The remarks of the instructors at the end of the project in
response to the question "What is the major benefit you received from
participation in this project?" were telling. They said: "(1) Deepened my
appreciation and understanding of diverse cultures. (2) Shared a growth
process with colleagues I did not know"; "The major benefit for me was an
increased awareness of how the humanities are so much a part of everything
we do. A part of this benefit was the relationships that were developed by
participating in this project"; "Working with people from other areas.
Exposure to literature I probably wouldn't have read;" "The motiviation to
read more history and literature provided by the grant and the discussion
with colleagues. It was particularly interesting to hear people's
reactions from different fields/occupations/curricula/degrees. I received
a more diverse outlook."
</p><p>
Collaboration on the NEH project brought faculty together in ways that
developed their appreciation not only of the texts read and the visiting
university scholars but also of each other's strengths and insights. They
are continuing to work together. One exciting outcome has been the
development of a new NEH-funded project to engage twenty faculty members
from different subject areas in two month-long summer institutes focusing
on Native American history and literature in 1995 and African American
history and literature in 1996. Participating faculty are from English,
communications, allied health, technology, music, sociology, biology, and
art. There is also a librarian this time.
</p><p>
Secretary of Labor Reich is absolutely right in targeting community
colleges as places where Americans can receive education leading them to
careers which will provide a middle class standard of living. He is also
right in pointing to the need for lifelong learning and the enrichment
which a broad education makes possible. By bringing faculty from different
departments and from occupational and liberal arts curricula together to
study and to talk to each other about primary texts, not only will the
courses be enriched by the multiple voices of Toni Morrison or Louise
Erdrich or Benjamin Franklin, but students will see that teachers talk to
each other and see connections between nursing and English or music and
history. Connected learning is vital to students足 and to faculty. We
cannot assume that the connections will just happen without structured
opportunities to make them happen. That's what the NEH projects are doing
for Kellogg Community College. Further, the administration and faculty see
these projects as a beginning and are eager to collaborate in other ways
and to encourage similar projects at other community colleges.
