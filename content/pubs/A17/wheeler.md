Artifacts of Technology as an Educational Resource</h2>
<font size="+1">By Robert G. Wheeler</font>
</center><hr/>
[Editor's note: Robert Wheeler's seminar on"Electricity,"offered by the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute in l989, included teachers of science,
life science, mathematics, home economics, business, and accounting. Each
Fellow was therefore challenged to find an important relation between the
topic of the seminar and his or her academic subject. And Professor
Wheeler was challenged to make his approach to the topic as
interdisciplinary as might be feasible. The curriculum units written
during the seminar ranged from "Teaching Basic Electricity" and "Changes
in Lifestyle Due to Electricity"to "Operating Electric Kitchen
Appliances,""The Fax Systems: A Bright Outlook for Business
Communications,""How Computers have Simplified Accounting,"and "Boolean
Algebra and its Application to Problem Solving." Professor Wheeler has
continued to reflect on the pedagogical problems posed by such a broadly
focused seminar.]
<p>
My concern as a seminar leader in the Teachers Institute is to explore
ways of conveying the knowledge and excitement of science and technology
to the Fellows. A "hands-on"approach, using experiment and demonstration,
is one way of conveying realistically the nature and methods of science.
In these days of scarce resources, however, the Fellows may find it
difficult to transfer such experiences to their classrooms. We should
therefore seek interesting examples from which we can draw scientific
generalizations that are broadly applicable. Such examples can often be
found among the technological artifacts in the studentsU own locality. Let
me illustrate with one about which I learned last summer Q an artifact
that would be very useful in the study of light and radio.
</p><p>
In Marion, Massachusetts, on the western shores of Buzzard's Bay, there
existed, from shortly before the First World War until a decade after the
Second, a forest of 400-foot-high towers supporting a radio antenna. Here
Guglielmo Marconi had constructed one of the Marconi Company's eleven
wireless transmitting stations to provide worldwide communications. During
the First World War the U. S. Navy appropriated the station for the
nationUs defense, and in l9l9 it formed a part of the assets of the new
company called the Radio Corporation of American (RCA).
</p><p>
The Marion installation operated at two different wave-lengths: ll,620 and
l3,420 meters. The frequencies were therefore very low, about 26,000 and
22,000 hertz (cycles per second) respectively. (The numerical product of
wave-length and frequency is the speed of light.) These low frequencies
were chosen in order to enable trans-Atlantic transmission. Nature has
provided, in the surface of the ocean and the ionosphere above, two facing
mirrors, each capable of reflecting electromagnetic waves with minimal
loss. A small bit of geometry and geography permits one to find that for
trans-Atlantic radio communications (from Marion to LandUs End) there have
to be four bounces of the waves, since the ionosphere is about l00
kilometers above the earthUs surface. This layer is composed of a very low
density of electrons and ions which itself has a natural frequency of
oscillation, the plasma frequency (about a million hertz.) As long as the
radio wave frequency is less than this plasma frequency, the ionosphere
reflects the radio wave. For frequencies higher than the plasma frequency,
the mirror ceases to work but instead lets the radio wave leak out into
space.
</p><p>
Another reason for the very low frequencies was the need for high radio
frequency (r.f.) power. The first wireless technologies were not very
efficient; in particular the receivers were quite sensitive. For Marconi's
system the transmitters radiated 200,000 watts of r.f. power Q a level
that could only be attained by interrupting high voltage electrical
discharges. By opening and closing these spark gaps, the Morse code of
dots and dashes could be impressed or modulated upon the waves. What is
the visible consequence of operating a station with such low frequencies
and long wave-lengths? In order to send radio waves efficiently into the
atmosphere, an antenna needs to be a quarter of the wave-length. The elder
residents of Marion still speak in awe of the rows of towers from which
the mile-long horizontal antenna was arrayed.
</p><p>
The Marion station had its main impact during the twenties, when it
competed successfully with the older trans-Atlantic cable. Because its
capital costs were much less than those of the undersea cable, it was
immediately of economic importance. From it, for example, the Wall
Streeters of the day obtained the London prices before the stock trading
opened in New York. A number of fortunes were based on this timely
information. As the next decade arrived, RCA expanded their services to
include voice transmission. By then, vacuum tube electronics had led to
more sensitive receivers. These new stations operated at a higher
frequency than Marion so that voice frequencies could more easily be
impressed upon the radio wave, yet not so high a frequency that the
ionosphere would cease to function as a mirror.
</p><p>
What general point is here most relevant to a seminar on light and radio?
Simply this: in all instances of electromagnetic reflection, the physics
remains the same though the numbers are different. Mirrors only work when
electric charges are able to move under the influence of the oscillating
electric field associated with the wave. The frequency above which
electromagnetic waves are transmitted rather than reflected varies with
the square root of the density of free electric charges. Thus the
ionosphere, which has a low charge density, is a reflector of long waves;
while aluminum metal, which has a very high charge density, can also
reflect light, whose wave-length is very small. High frequencies also have
a technological advantage. The higher the frequency of the electromagnetic
wave, the greater the possible rate of modulation. As a result, more
simultaneous channels become available with a single transmitter station,
which decreases the cost for each channel. As we have proceeded to use
higher frequencies for worldwide communications, we have had to replace
natureUs mirrors with active reflectors or re-broadcasting stations placed
upon satellites, which are much above the ionosphere. Through all these
technological changes, however, the physics remains the same.
