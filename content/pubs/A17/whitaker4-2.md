Voices From the Classroom</h2>
<font size="+1">By Thomas Whitaker</font>
</center><hr/>
We are delighted to announce that our Editorial Board now includes three
more classroom teachers. Sharon Floyd, an English teacher from Saginaw
High School in Saginaw, Michigan has worked on projects with the
University of Michigan's Center for Educational Improvement through
Collaboration. Patricia King, a guidance counselor and teacher from New
Hanover-Upper Frederick Elementary School in Boyertown, Pennsylvania, has
been active in collaborative projects in the Lehigh Valley. Sharon Olguin
is a clinical supervisor for the Career Development Program of the
Albuquerque Public Schools/University of New Mexico Collaborative.
<p>
During the January meeting of the Editorial Board in Santa Fe, we asked
these teachers to say something about their experience in collaborative
projects and about the potential usefulness of <i>On Common Ground.</i>
Here are some excerpts from our conversation:
</p><p>
MANUEL GÓMEZ: What for you has been the value of working in
cooperation with university colleagues, or other colleagues in the
community, or fellow teachers?
</p><p>
SHARON FLOYD: Working in collaborative projects has given me confidence to
deal with an emerging curriculum. Right now I'm involved in a project
titled "Write for your life," which deals with health issues that students
face. My curriculum emerges from the topic that interested my students
most, teen violence. That's a nationwide issue that has impacted on all
our lives in one way or another. In such a collaborative project we don't
try to make the issue fit the material that we already had. With the
support of the university, we frame the issue and then find the material.
Collaborative projects have also taught me that its OK to be different, to
try something in a non-traditional way. I might do the same thing three
different ways trying to reach all my students. They have also introduced
me to team teaching, and to working with people from outside the school.
That's another plus. We have also, because of collaboration, begun to work
with writing across the curriculum in science and math, and other people
on our staff now look to us to help them generate writing in various
classrooms.
</p><p>
PATRICIA KING: As the guidance counselor, I had the job of setting up an
effective instructional support team in our building and deciding how we
were going to run it. With a lot of help from the principal and our
wonderful reading specialist, we sat down and tried to decide how to
proceed. We decided that we were all in it together and we moved along.
Some of the other schools in our district moved more quickly, through
administrative decisions. But we chose to move more slowly and bring
everybody on board as we went. And by far the most valuable experience for
us was having Elaine Moe from Lehigh come in to work with us and make
suggestions. The way ideas are presented to the teachers can make all the
difference as to how effective a project will be. And so can the support
of the school administration.
</p><p>
SHARON OLGUIN: My experience with collaboration began with my work on my
master's degree in a collaborative program. What I discovered then was
that I never wanted not to be part of some collaboration. Teaching in
itself is isolating, but in collaborative relationships you can have
continued dialogue about curricular issues, and about children and their
needs. Collaborative experiences have also given me greater autonomy, and
a feeling of empowerment. They have helped me toward my goal of being a
reflective practitioner and lifelong learner. My present work involves
responding on a weekly basis to our interns' journals, and I'm continually
impressed by their commitment to teaching and their understanding of, or
questions about, pedagogy and philosophical beliefs. This process is
mutually enriching. I have also assumed the role of being a messenger to
the general public, helping them to understand the changing nature of
education today.
</p><p>
MANUEL GÓMEZ: You speak of experiencing greater autonomy as a result
of collaborative activity. Can you explain that paradox? Perhaps if
traditionalist teachers, or those who are fearful of collaboration, could
see how greater autonomy can result, they might be more eager to engage in
such efforts.
</p><p>
SHARON OLGUIN: Dr. Auger from our university has looked at that issue in
this way: He suggests that as children we're dependent on our parents, and
as we grow up we become independent, and then in our further experiences
we move toward interdependence. We share that paradigm with our students.
As they move into teaching, they're dependent on us as the deliverers of
information, and they move to independence as they can deliver instruction
on their own, but the ultimate goal is that move towards interdependence
which is really very freeing.
</p><p>
PATRICIA KING: Also important here is the leadership within the school,
the tone the principal sets. If the principal really believes in
collaboration and in empowering teachers to be active participants in
their school, that starts to come about. If it's nurtured and valued,
teachers begin to buy into it. But another problem is that often we're not
given the time to collaborate with one another or with anyone else.
</p><p>
SHARON FLOYD: I agree. Many people don't want to become involved because
of the time factor. They view it as a separate planning session when
you're already teaching three or four English classes. But because this is
something that you're collaborating on, then they want released time. When
we started out we had released time to collaborate. But it didn't last.
Right now we have a project that is not working in our school with
collaboration that's supposed to be going on between an English teacher
and a history teacher, but because they don't have released time they
refuse to do it.
</p><p>
JAY ROBINSON: I guess this does get to a question I wonder if you'd
comment on. Much of the argument for collaboration rests on the assumption
that teacher voices will then be given more strength in the kinds of
discussions that really count. I'm thinking particularly about discussions
that would lead to real structural change in the schools. Do you feel
that's happening?
</p><p>
SHARON OLGUIN: I think in part in our district that it is happening. We
have many principals like Charles Serns who are really listening to their
teachers, and asking them what their needs are and what kinds of change
would benefit their students, and trying to respond to that. I don't know
that it extends itself beyond a particular school site and its
administrator, however.
</p><p>
PATRICIA KING: You know, I sit here and think Albuquerque, New Mexico, and
East Greenville, Pennsylvania, are very far apart but we're so very close
in other ways. I would say the same thing. We move toward site based
management. There are some wonderful things going on, and my elementary
school is a good example. We have a very supportive principal who listens
to the teachers, goes to the central administration and fights for his
teachers and their ideas and what we need in our school to make special
education, for instance, more effective. But in some other places the
principal may work less well with the teachers.
</p><p>
JAMES VIVIAN: Could you comment on ways in which On Common Ground can
serve teachers, or ways in which it can give a stronger voice to some of
the matters you've been raising here?
</p><p>
SHARON OLGUIN: I was struck by the global view of collaboration. I
realized that my vision of collaboration had been very narrow - - limited
to my school district and the university. But in reading the articles I
really appreciated being given a perspective that is broad and
interdisciplinary. I also want to comment on the inclusion of the art, and
the connections to art that are brought forth in the articles. This
periodical is a powerful voice moving towards what we need   to look at
art as a tool for continued learning. We're finding that art is always the
first thing that's done away with because there isn't any funding, and
I've recently developed a very different understanding about art. One of
the students I supervised was an artist, who was integrating art into his
classroom_a classroom with six different cultures and lots of low esteem.
What I saw happen through his use of art as an instructional tool was a
great improvement in their self esteem and also a real control and
understanding in the field of art.
</p><p>
JAMES VIVIAN then asked: "How can <i>On Common Ground</i>  give teachers
more of a voice to reach the audience of college and university
presidents, chief state school officers, corporate and foundation heads,
and the like_those who may be important agents of change?" And the
responses of SHARON FLOYD, PATRICIA KING, and SHARON OLGUIN all pointed in
the same direction: "I think that if there is an opportunity to let
teachers submit manuscripts talking about their collaborative experiences.
. ." "As well as their needs. . ." "Yes, yes. The pros and cons of
collaborative experiences. . ." "Voicing the impacts it's had on their
professional lives. . ." "I think sometimes administrations, and maybe
universities, don't understand what's going on inside of the teacher
trying to make it day to day and work effectively in a public school
situation."
</p><p>
Can this piece, "Voices from the Classroom," become a regular feature of
On Common Ground? The answer, we think, lies in your hands. Our three new
board members thought it would be especially helpful to our readers   both
to those who work in the classroom and to those who don't   if teachers
could provide testimonials about the collaborative experiences that have
powerfully influenced their own practice. Let us hear from you!
