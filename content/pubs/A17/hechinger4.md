About Partnership: The New High School Reform Movement</h2>
<p><font size="+1">By Fred Hechinger</font>
</p></center><hr/>
Partnership between the universities and the public schools is not new in
American history. Reform of the schools has often been led by university
leaders. For example, in 1890, President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard
University, using his great prestige, complained that three-fourths of the
population had no access to secondary education and he made public school
reform a major task of the university. Many colleges at the time had to
offer remedial education courses. Eliot called for more high schools
offering greater access to more students and higher standards for all high
schools.
<p>
Almost 80 years later, in 1959, another president of Harvard became the
lead reformer of public school change. James Bryant Conant ignored both
the post-Sputnik charges that American education had become a wasteland
and the counter claims that schools were better than ever and needed only
to be given more money to solve all their remaining problems. Schools,
Conant said, would have to offer comprehensive programs, aimed at
satisfying those who were preparing for college as well as those who
needed  marketable skills  with which to earn a living upon graduation.
Social democracy, which seemed to Conant the modern mantle of America s
republican heritage, would best be achieved by having young people from "a
wide variety of backgrounds and of great variety of talents mingle within
the same school."
</p><p>
Both leaders, Conant and Eliot, as well as other university reformers of
the public schools, have done a great service in calling public attention
to problems in elementary and secondary education. They did, however,
overlook the actual needs of real children. They had tried to reform the
systems without dealing directly with the problems of those served   the
students. In the   tion of this relatively small group o ple for the e1950s0, Conant had accurately charged that the junior high
school did not serve those needs. It was, he found, actually a replica of
the senior high school. He reported that these schools cared more for
marching bands than about the actual needs of young students.
</p><p>
Now in the late 1980s, the Carnegie Corporation of New York trained its
attention on those needs. Its report, <i>Turning Points</i>, transformed
the
junior high school into a middle school, which tried to make it its main
purpose to insure all the young adolescents would find themselves in
schools in which they knew the teachers and the teachers knew them.
</p><p>
This would be accomplished by dividing schools into small units of no more
than 150 students, each of them taught by a team of either four or five
teachers, representing English, social studies, science, and mathematics.
The team would be entirely responsible for the education of this
relatively small group of children.
</p><p>
This obviously raised the question: What happens to these youngsters once
they reach high school? Would they be entering large institutions and
moving from class to class, taught by different teachers and become
essentially anonymous units? Adolescents, like adults, behave at their
worst when they are anonymous, when nobody knows or cares for them.
</p><p>
Carnegie is currently looking at ways to reform the senior high school.
While the outcome of this reform proposal may not be an exact replica of
the foundation s <i>Turning Points</i>, some of the middle school
experience may be helpful in reforming the high schools. Changes will not
be easy. High schools are strongly embedded in the autonomy of the
separate disciplines. The idea of interdisciplinary teaming will not be
readily accepted.
</p><p>
This could be a special opportunity for the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute to move into the forefront of the new high school reform
movement. As it has pioneered in developing the relationship between
university professors and public school teachers, it might now be ready to
enlarge its experience to the relationship between university faculties
and high school teachers. Eliot and Conant, after all, led the movement to
greater access by more young people to high school education, and thereby
to access to higher education and to the work force. Now, universities can
again show their great strength in shaping the future of the high schools.
University faculties have already experimented with the idea of
interdisciplinary teaching; they could now offer their experience to
leading high school instructors and demonstrate the concept of teaming and
a closer relationship between teachers and students.
</p><p>
As Harvard took the lead in the two previous school reform efforts, Yale
now could have the opportunity to pioneer in reforms for the next
century's schools.
