Student Artwork: Collaborative Quilt of Transformation</h2>
<font size="+1">by Helen Seigel</font>
</center><hr/>
This quilt image was created by twenty students (grades 3-5) at  Diamond
Elementary School who are participants in the Special  Studio art program
with artist Helen Seigel.  Together the student  artists and the
professional artist worked to construct an image that  would be both
visually stunning and conceptually challenging.  Each  student was
photographed in three positions: receiving, observing,  and giving an
object.  Next, students used oil pastels to design a wall  and floor
background, applying their knowledge of basic color theory  and pattern.
They voted to alternate warm and cool colors on the  walls and to be free
to choose their own colors for the floors.   Conceptual planning
discussions included issues such as how to work  together successfully as
a group.  Inherent in this process was the  establishing of guidelines or
rules for everyone to follow.  Equally  important were opportunities for
free expression by each individual  member of the group.  After gluing the
photographs onto the  completed backgrounds, students gathered to plan the
objects which  they would be passing on to one another.  With the group
seated in  the configuration of the actual artwork, Ms. Seigel "handed"
the  world to Marta Navarro (top left), who picked it up, transformed it
first into a baseball (considering its round form), and then into a
balloon.  Her neighbor (to the right), Isidro Montoya, took her balloon
and changed it into a circular frisbee, and then into a dog (for its
conceptual connection).  This pattern continues throughout the piece,
each student receiving something, reinterpreting and reinventing  that
object, making formal or conceptual associations as they worked.
Students used colored pencils and markers to draw their objects.   They
had to carefully consider the scale and position of each item so  that it
would fit into their hands.  Upon completion of these mixed  media
collages (oil pastels, colored pencils, markers, and  photography) the
technology of color copying was employed to unify  diverse textures into a
harmonious and magical blend.

The resulting "quilt" of giving and taking not only demonstrates the
students' mastery of art elements, design, and techniques, but also
illustrates how visual art is a powerful vehicle for critical thinking,
exploration, invention, and collaboration.

Young Special Studio artists (grades 3-5) at Harvey Elementary  School
brain-stormed together to make a list of things that they  could not do
without the help of others.  Then they each selected a  theme which they
would develop into a piece of art.  Individual  students could invite up
to four other students to participate in their  work.  Acting as
directors, students advised their peers as to how  they might most
successfully pose to communicate their idea.   Photographs include the
student artist and his/her "actors."  Students  then combined the
resulting photographs with colored pencils,  markers, oil pastels, and
magazine images to create evocative mixed  media collages.  Finally, the
collages were turned into color prints  which seem to make their fantasies
appear to be real!

These pieces are truly mixed media works as they combine art  materials,
mass media imagery, drama, and student collaboration to  yield striking,
original statements.
