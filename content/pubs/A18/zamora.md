<center><h2>
A Reader, A Writer</h2>
<hr/>
A writer is a person who paints,
<br/>whose pallet holds words 
<br/>whose mind holds visions. 
<br/>A mind filled with joy and thoughts.
<p>
A reader is a person with the gift 
<br/>of seeing the meaning of the writer's work 
<br/>and hears the voiceless message 
<br/>who sees the colorless picture.
</p><p>
But the reader and the writer 
<br/>hold one thing alike, 
<br/>an imagination.
