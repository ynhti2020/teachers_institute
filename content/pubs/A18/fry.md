Poetry in the Classroom: The Beecher Experiment</h2>

<h3>By Paul H. Fry</h3>
One pleasant spring morning this year, Yale-New Haven Teachers  Institute
Director James Vivian and I attended a gathering called  "International
Fiesta Day" at the Beecher School in New Haven.  We  had been invited
because the four teachers presenting the event had  attended my Summer
1994 Teachers Institute seminar called "Poems  on Pictures, Places, and
People."  These teachers, Francine Coss (K),  Geraldine Martin (l),
Patrice Flynn (3), and Seminar Coordinator Jean  Sutherland (5), had
applied for the seminar as a "team" intending  from the outset to work
toward a Fiesta Day.  They hoped to  emphasize the diversity of human
cultures for the benefit of their  students, nearly all of whom are
African-American.  Coss wanted to  prepare a unit on the American Colonial
Period, Martin on ancient  and modern Mexico, Flynn on Japanese culture,
and Sutherland on  African-American traditions.  Their having joined
forces, both in the  seminar and in an interactive, cooperative approach
to teaching in  their school, was envisioned by the Institute as a
prototype for  future group projects.
<p>
I think the experiment was a wonderful success at every stage.  My  first
response, though, when I saw the applications, was skeptical.  I  wondered
whether poetry would really prove necessary or even  useful as the
teachers' plans developed; and I wondered whether a  "team" with its
collective aims could contribute the focused  individuality of perspective
on weekly topics that is needed in a  seminar of twelve persons.  But I
saw right away that my doubts  were unjustified.  Not only did poetry
prove to be an unforced and  natural point of focus for the curriculum
units these four teachers  prepared, but in fact they hewed more closely
to the announced  issues of the seminar (pictures, places, and people)
than did most of  their colleagues.  So diverse were the units apart from
these four  that I decided to rename my volume of units (Volume II, 1994)
"Poetry in the Classroom:  Incentive and Dramatization."  Nearly all  the
units produced by the teachers in this seminar were excellent,  but I
recommend reading those of the Beecher team in particular as  models of
the way in which the ecphrastic, regional, and social  specificity of
poetry can bring multicultural teaching to life in the  classroom.

Francine Coss used early American hornbook verse, especially  illustrated
Alphabet Rhymes, to teach her kindergartners both the  alphabet and the
rather stern yet kindly-disposed virtues inculcated  by such rhymes.
Geraldine Martin devised a "counting train" (<i>uno</i>  through
<i>diez</i>) to teach the geography, daily lives, and social practices  of
the ancient and modern Mexicans (Mexico is
one足<i>uno</i>足country,  for example, but it has harbored
three足<i>tres</i>足ancient civilizations,  etc.):  and each
number-coded lesson was illustrated and augmented  with poems written by
Mexican adults and children.  Patrice Flynn's  challenge was to emphasize
the unfamiliar in Japanese culture, and  for this purpose, in addition to
<i>haiku</i> and other forms, she chose  poetry written and compiled into
books by Japanese school children.   Jean Sutherland, finally, worked with
traditional folk verse (jump  rope rhymes, field songs, wedding poems) to
illustrate the language  and values of her students' native cultural
tradition.  I hope this  brief summary will give some sense of the
ingenious and exhaustive  research efforts undertaken by all four
teachers.  Apart from some of  Jean Sutherland's materials, I the poetry
professor had never  encountered or even known of the poetry (published in
pleasing  English translations yet languishing unread and out of print)
that the  Beecher team's curriculum units make available.
</p><p>
And then came Fiesta Day.  Francine Coss's children, in early  American
headgear and enunciating at the top of their lungs, recited  a book of
alphabet rhymes, each responsible for a letter and holding  up the
pertinent picture.  Focusing on poetry throughout, Geraldine  Martin's
Counting Train in serapes and white blouses recited and  sang poems
chorally, with interspersed solos.  Patrice Flynn's class  did relatively
little with the poetry they had been studying but chose  instead to stage
a short <i>Noh</i> play about the wedding of a princess and  a commoner
forbidden by the cruel king on earth but celebrated  among the stars.  And
Jean Sutherland's fifth graders, boys and girls  in some cases nearly six
feet tall, recited poems they themselves had  written in praise of
parents, caregivers, and friends singled out from  the audience.  Many
were in tears, and one poet was so overwhelmed  that she just stood with
her aunt, unable to speak a word.  The event  lasted nearly the entire
morning (we adjourned for the food of our  cultures), but all the
teachers, administrators, children, and parents  were spellbound to the
end, hardly aware that time was passing.

<h3>By Jean E. Sutherland</h3>
"I cried, but inside I felt proud.  I thought everybody was crying
sadness, but they were crying happiness.  To me the assembly was very
important not because I was in it but because all four classes worked hard
and did well."
<p>
These words, written by one of my fifth grade pupils, typify the reactions
of children, parents, staff, and other guests lucky enough to experience
our festival of culture through poetry.  This was a combined production,
the culminating event of curriculum units written and taught by four L.W.
Beecher classroom teachers representing kindergarten, first, third, and
fifth grade.  As members of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, we had
been enrolled in Professor Paul Fry's seminar, "Poems on Pictures, Places,
and People." 
</p><p>
The idea of working as a team started about a year and a half before the
final program. Since the Institute's steering committee had encouraged
school colleagues to apply to seminars as a team, the Beecher group met to
discuss possibilities. Our idea of using poetry as the basis for studying
Colonial American (kindergarten), Mexican (first grade), Japanese (third),
and African American (fifth) culture was born.  A key objective of our
team was to encourage interaction among pupils and teachers across grade
levels, with an eye toward involving other staff members.  Parental
involvement was an absolute must.
</p><p>
In our Yale seminar, a group of twelve teachers studied and discussed
poetry which was primarily far beyond our pupils' grasp.  At the same
time, we developed our individual teaching units geared to our particular
grade level, but motivated largely by our seminar experiences.
Throughout, we met individually with Professor Fry, who provided comments
and suggestions on the various stages of our unit writing.  Independently,
the Beecher group met regularly, checking their progress as a team.
</p><p>
During the school year that followed, our team's writing was put into
action.  First, we developed a schedule for teaching material and staging
culminating events and also planned for cooperative activities across
grade levels. Individually we began teaching our material to our pupils as
we had prescribed in our own units.  Some of our most successful lessons
involved two classrooms working together.  My fifth grade paired up with
first graders.  Together each couple wrote and illustrated a poem
patterned after a short Mexican piece presented by the first grade
teacher.  Fifth graders taught first graders hand games based upon
traditional African American rhymes which, after being presented at our
festival, became a school-wide fad.  
For that festival the parents planned, shopped for, prepared and served an
overwhelming buffet of food representing each of the cultures the team had
covered.  Parents also sewed costumes, taught a Mexican dance, wrote and
presented a poem, provided martial arts entertainment during the buffet,
and some, including a hundred year old grandmother, were honored in person
through their child's original poem.
