My Father</h2>
<hr/>
My father was very handsome.
<br/>My father was thoughtful and <br/>  lots of fun.
<p>
My father was very nice,<br/>
He loved to play games and <br/>   shoot dice.
</p><p>
My father was a big kid.<br/>
Anything I asked him to do <br/>  he did.
</p><p>
My father was very light-skinned,
<br/>Not too fat, not too thin, just right.
<br/>I think he never liked to see me fight.
</p><p>
My father had nice curly hair. 
<br/>When I needed him, he was always there.
</p><p>
My father tried to teach me lots of    <br/> stuff back then. 
<br/>One thing was to swim.
</p><p>
When anybody messed with me,
<br/>it didn't bother me because,
<br/>back then I knew I had my father.
</p><p>
By now I think you know, 
<br/>he's gone. 
<br/>His memory will stay with me very long.
</p><p>
My father, Nathan Spearman,
<br/>  passed away July 31, 1994.
<br/> I will remember him always.
