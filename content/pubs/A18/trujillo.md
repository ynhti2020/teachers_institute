Saint Joseph Ballet's Program for Inner-City Children</h2>
<font size="+1">by Marty Trujillo</font>
</center><hr/>
One of the more demoralizing aspects of growing up in a poor  community is
the impoverished view of the world it presents.   Miracles occasionally
occur, however, when individuals are able to  reach into those
communities, inspire the children who live there,  and offer them the time
and encouragement to expand their  knowledge and appreciation of the world
and their place in it.  The  Saint Joseph Ballet has been inspiring the
children of Orange County,  California, for 12 years, and it has been able
to be a source of  inspiration because of its partnership with local
school districts,  businesses, and the communities themselves.
<p>
An example of this partnership is the Ballet's long-standing  relationship
with the University of California in Irvine.  Dance  Professor and
internationally known choreographer Donald McKayle  serves on the Ballet's
Board of Directors and is currently producing a  work involving both the
Ballet's dancers and his own college  students.  UCI alumna Gina Lo Preste
is an assistant instructor for the  Ballet.  In many cases, these teachers
are the first college graduates  the children have known outside the
classroom.

The Ballet is the largest organization in Southern California offering
quality arts programming to children from low-income families as an
after-school and summer activity.  The Ballet, which makes its home  in a
Latino enclave in downtown Santa Ana, emerged from a highly  successful
pilot program originally funded by the Ahmanson  Foundation back in 1983.
Its goals have been simple and direct from  the start:  to provide dance
training to inner city youths free of  charge as a means of preventing
delinquency, building self-esteem,  teaching new skills, and ultimately,
changing their lives.  The  children participating in the Ballet perform
to music that reflects a  multitude of heritages, including, in many
cases, their own.  The  beauty and grace that result from discipline,
teamwork, and hard  work are displayed through the troupe's performances,
which have  become fixtures on the Orange County arts scene.
</p><p>
Under its Artistic Director, Beth Burns, the Ballet offers a variety of
programs.  Besides its year-round dancing program, it brings  week-long
dance workshops to elementary and intermediate schools  in the poorest
neighborhoods of Santa Ana.  This partnership not  only strengthens the
troupe's ties to the community by drawing  more low-income children into
its year-round program, it also helps  to assure the arts will remain a
component of the public school  curriculum.
</p><p>
Early last year the Ballet's Board of Directors also established an
Advanced Training Scholarship Fund.  The scholarship pro-
gram enables low income "graduates" of the Ballet to attend college  and
continue their dance training.  They awarded the first two  scholarships
last year, and two students­the first in their families to  receive a
college education­are attending the North Carolina School  of the
Arts with the aid of this fund.
</p><p>
The Ballet derives its mission from its simple goals, but its impact
transcends this.  The DanceFree Weeks program is evaluated  annually to
ensure its effectiveness.  Comments offered following the  most recent
outreach concluded that the "wonderful" program had  "excellent"
instructors who gave "children who have difficulty  academically a chance
to excel in something else."  The comments  also noted that the program
increased the students' "awareness of  movement ad professional dance," as
well as increasing self-esteem  and helping to create a positive school
atmosphere.
</p><p>
In its eleven years of service to the community, the Ballet's activities
have reached more than 23,000 Orange County inner city youths.   The
statistics are telling:  Ninety-six percent of the Ballet dancers are
from low income families.  A typical dancer comes from a family of  five
whose average monthly income is $1,000.  At least 92 percent of  the
participants represent the Latino, African American, and Asian
communities of Santa Ana and neighboring cities.  Since 1985, the
DanceFree Week workshops have been presented to more than  19,000
students, with seventeen hundred participating in October of  1994 alone.
</p><p>
The true success of the program lies in the kids themselves.  One  child,
14-year-old Liz Lira, who has been with the Ballet for three  and a half
years, credits her dancing with helping her remain focused  upon her
studies.  "When dancing," she says, "I'm focused more on  what I'm doing,
so in school, I'm more focused on what I'm doing.   When performing, you
may be nervous at first because you may  think you might mess up or fall,
but once you have performed and  you see that people like who you are and
not what you did or do, you  feel very confident in what you do because no
matter what, your  friends in the company are there for you."  The hours
of preparation,  the desire to achieve, the willingness to
participate­these all  conspire to assist children become more
assured, more creative, more  human.
