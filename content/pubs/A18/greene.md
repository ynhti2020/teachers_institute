Metaphors and Responsibility</h2>

<blockquote>
<i>"The Possible's slow fuse is lit by the imagination"   <br/>
Emily Dickinson</i></blockquote>
<p>
The fuse may be slow because of the ways in which the imaginative
capacity has been ignored.  In the many education reports that have
appeared in recent years, imagination plays no part.  In plans for
cooperative work among teachers and professors, the stress is on
pragmatic issues:  standards, disciplines, benchmarks, approaches to
assessment.  The exclusion of metaphor and imagination from  projects for
reconstruction cannot be due to a lack of acquaintance  with literature
and other arts.  Old dualisms, old oppositions seem to  persist when
education is talked about:  the subjective is opposed to  the objective,
the affective to the cognitive.  People feel compelled to  use the flat
language of the social sciences when they make proposals  about young
people, especially those different from themselves.   They try to be cool,
empirical, "objective" when deciding how diverse  youth ought to come
together, to be initiated into a common world.   The manageable and the
predictable become important, not the  unmeasurable and the merely
possible.  We might recall Wallace  Stevens and his rendering of that
metaphor for imagination足the  "blue guitar":
</p><blockquote>They said, "You have a blue guitar,
<br/>You do not play things as they are."
<p>
The man replied, "Things as they are
<br/>Are changed upon the blue guitar."
</p><p>
And they said then, "But play, you must,
<br/>A tune beyond us, yet ourselves,
</p><p>
A tune upon the blue guitar
<br/>Of things exactly as they are." 
</p></blockquote>
Those who demand a rendering of "things exactly as they are" often  assume
an objective reality that can and should be precisely  captured.  To use
imagination is to summon up an "as/if", to look at  things as if they
could be otherwise.  This does not deny firm  evidence of what is "real"
and "true."  It does, however, enable us to  break with the
one-dimensional vision, to look towards what might  or what ought to be.
Clearly, this is troubling to those who seek the  comfort of the familiar.
For others, however, it signifies an end to  submission to the
taken-for-granted, to what has seemed  inescapably "given":  the "bell
curve" rendering of human  intelligence; the inevitability of poverty; the
tie between material  success and merit.  It often takes metaphorical
thinking to break  with old certainties in this way, whether we realize it
fully or reflect  on what it means.
<p>
We do realize that a metaphor enables us to understand one thing  better
by likening it to what is not, as in the case of the blue guitar.   Poetry
still is the source of the best examples.  Here is Muriel  Rukeyser
writing about breaking through boundaries, doing  unexpected things with
space:
</p><blockquote>After the lifting of the mist
<br/>after the lift of the heavy rains
<br/>the sky stands clear
<br/>and the cries of the city risen in day
<br/>I remember the buildings are space
<br/>walled, to let space be used for living
<br/>I mind this room is space
<br/>this drinking glass is space
<br/>whose boundary of glass
<br/>lets me give you drink and space to
<br/>drink
<br/>your hand, my hand being space
<br/>containing skies and constellations
<br/>your face
<br/>carries the reaches of air
<br/>I know I am space
<br/>my words are air.    
</blockquote>
As in so many other instances of metaphor, we are enabled to move  from
one state of things to another, to reach through the walls, the  glass
towards the possibility of "skies and constellations"足and do so  by
an imaginative act.
<p>
An obvious response, certainly from those who want things "as they  are,"
is to ask what the "blue guitar" or a "hand being space" literally  mean.
But there are many who make the point that a metaphor does  not say what
it means; since the meaning of it is the transformation  it brings about
in the listener or the reader.  "Metaphor," writes G.B.  Madison in <i>The
Hermeneutics of Postmo-dernity</i>, "performs an  existential function in
that it provokes a change in the way we view  things, it brings about a
transformation in our thinking."  The  intelligibility of the blue guitar
or the hand being space lies in its  power to effect a change in attitude,
direction, and at length  understanding.  
</p><p>
If meaning, then, is an event or a happening, it may be a generator of
choosing on the part of the participant足the reader or the listener.
This does not mean, however, that metaphor is not linked with  language or
that the unexpected perspectives it may open are not  due to unexpected
usages of words.  The center of language may well  be the metaphor; and it
is language that has the capability of  provoking changes in our ways of
thinking, knowing, seeing.  One of  the things that makes metaphor so
important to the discourse about  education is that it can make visible
and palpable particular  phenomena, those so often submerged in
categories.  It may well be  that attention paid to literature and the
several arts, not simply as  component parts of new curricula, but as
occasions for experience on  the part of those engaged in observing and
reform, can release ways  of seeing that go beyond the language of report.
</p><p>
An attending to metaphor can effect new connections in experience,
disclosing new configurations to the mind.  We find out, as Mary  Warnock
has written in <i>Imagination</i>, "that there is always <i>more</i> to
experience and <i>more in</i> what we experience than we can predict.
Without some such sense, even at the quite human level of there  being
something which deeply absorbs our interest, human life  becomes perhaps
not actually futile or pointless, but experienced as  if it were."  To
enter into considerations of a teaching activity, a  classroom project, a
writing program with such a feeling of interest  and absorption is quite
different from entering in from a vantage  point of expertise or a
politely distanced "friendly criticism."   Energized, in a matter of
speaking, by metaphor, we may be able to  think in terms of untapped
possibility.
</p><p>
Metaphor also has to do with empathy, the capacity to look through
another's eyes.  Metaphor, writes Cynthia Ozick in <i>Metaphor and
Memory</i>, is "a shocking extension of the unknown into our most
intimate, most feeling, most private selves...."  She goes on to talk
about the important "power of connection," and of the continuities
metaphor can create.  It takes a metaphor, she tells us, to transform
memory into a principle of continuity inexperience.  "Through  metaphor,"
says Ozick, "the past has the capacity to imagine us, and  we it.  Through
metaphorical concentration, doctors can imagine what  it is to be their
patients.  Those who have no pain can imagine those  who suffer.  Those at
the center can imagine what it is to be outside.   The strong can imagine
the weak.  Illuminated lives can imagine the  dark.   Poets in their
twilight can imagine the borders of stellar fire.   We strangers can
imagine the familiar hearts of strangers."  This has  relevance, clearly,
for all sorts of relationships within institutions and  in classrooms as
well.
</p><p>
Empathy is not to be viewed as a mode of intuitive identification.   More
important is the beginning of authentic dialogue cued to a  sense of the
being of the "stranger."  Nothing is gained by fusing with  another, wrote
Mikhail Bakhtin, the Russian thinker and linguist.  It  is better, he
wrote, for the other to stay on the outside "because from  there he can
know and see what I cannot see or know from my  vantage point, and he can
thus enrich essentially the event of my  life."  Our present interest in
multiple perspectives may be seen as a  way of enriching the events of
diverse private lives.  Classroom  communities require an inclusion of
plural vantage points:  those of  children, adults, newcomers, scholars,
neighborhood representatives.   There need be no identification; but the
stranger's vision, if opened  by imagination, can expand and widen the
worlds of those who have  been present since their beginnings.  Similarly,
if dialogue and  authentic conversation take place, the stranger or the
newcomer can  be gradually moved to attend to others' stories, to
apprehend  through others' eyes the world she/he is expected to join.  In
many  ways, for university people as well as school people, it is a matter
of  entering into others' narratives in order to grasp how they construct
their realities.  Only when this is understood, can the questioning be
provoked on the part of learners, the questioning with which  learning
begins.  
</p><p>
A rich example of the powers of metaphor can be found in Toni  Morrison's
novel, <i>The Bluest Eye</i> (1972).  Pecola Breedlove, an  unloved Black
child made to believe she is ugly, yearns to have blue  eyes, pretty blue
eyes.  She thinks that "if those eyes of hers were  different, that is to
say beautiful, she herself would be different."   Her mother and father
would be different.  "Maybe they'd say, 'Why  look at pretty-eyed Pecola.
We mustn't do bad things in front of  those pretty eyes.'"  Unable to see
her own beauty, she wants to look  like Shirley Temple.  Claudia, who
tells most of the story, hates  blue-eyed dolls when she is young and
tries to dismember them.   Ashamed at last, her hatred turns into
"fraudulent love."  And then,  "It was a small step to Shirley Temple.  I
learned much later to  worship her, just as I learned to delight in
cleanliness, knowing, even  as I learned, that the change was adjustment
without improvement."   It would appear that there are few more potent
ways of relating to  the hopes and sufferings and misconceptions of young
people like  Pecola足strangers to many university people, strangers to
their own  teachers, who may need to be urged at last to imagine.
</p><p>
To respond to a rendering like this is quite different than responding  to
any social scientific exposure of racism or unfairness.  It is  different,
too, from looking at photographs of lost children on city  streets,
stunned adults unable to intercede.  We achieve something  resembling
empathy, something that may open the way to a  dialogical relationship.
We are continually reminded of the way in  which the modern consciousness
exists in a polyglot world.  The only  way to pay heed, it may follow, is
by attending to the multiple voices  sounding in ourselves as we try to
look through unfamiliar  perspectives at a world shared with so many we do
not know.  If we  can perceive all this by means of metaphor, if we can
grasp the edges  of deficiency and desire, we may be moved in new ways to
repair.
</p><p>
Arguing for the need to turn towards the "possible" by, at moments,
altering our language, arguing als for more attention to the arts, we
might summon up some other signs in the wind.  There is, for  example,
Mike Rose's <i>Possible Lives</i>, subtitled "The Promise of Public
Education in America." Needing to go beyond the overly familiar, he  says,
we need an altered critique, "one that does not minimize the  inadequacies
of curriculum and instruction, the rigidity of school  structure, the
'savage inequalities' of funding but that simultaneously  opens discursive
space for inspired teaching, for courage, for  achievement  against odds,
for successful struggle, for the insight and  connection that occur
continually in public school classrooms around  the country."  His book is
an account of conversations in intimate  visits to schools across the
country.  Escaping some of the bounds of  literal, discursive speech, he
is able to link a recognition of what is  missing to the space of what
might be.  "Imagine you're the CEO...," he  writes.  "Imagine you're the
owner of a house in East L.A. and you're  losing it to a redevelopment
project."  And then, speaking of a  discouraged teacher imagining what
might be as she watches the  children walking in the door:  "They're the
difference.  They're eager.   They're capable.  Sure there's a challenge
to reach a drug baby, the  special ed child who's mainstreamed, the second
language  speaker...so you work at it."  A pause, and the teacher says,
"And it  takes desire."  That is one of the points of metaphorical
language:  it  is propelled by desire; it evokes desire.
</p><p>
Mike Rose realizes that public education is forever unfinished, like  the
democratic community itself.  He sees schools where what John  Dewey
called a "we" and an "our" are emerging, where the  consequences of
combined action are perceived and become an object  of desire and effort.
Dewey knew that consciousness of this sort has  always been enhanced by
encounters with the arts.  "The function of  art," he said, "has always
been to break through he crust of  conventionalized and routine
consciousness.  Common things, a  flower, a gleam of moonlight, the song
of a bird, not things rare and  remote, are means with which the deeper
levels of life are touched  so that they spring up as desire and thought.
The process is art."   The making of community, for him, like the opening
out of public  education, depended for him on the arousing of desire, on a
consciousness of possibility.
</p><p>
Deborah Meier, in <i>The Power of Their Ideas</i>, speaks of the
importance of imagination in the lives of children, leading (among  other
things) to the kind of imaginative play that leads to friendships  and
"the ability to imagine the world without oneself at its center."  She
rightly says:  "As we eliminate from our schools and from  children's
after-school lives the time and space for exercising their  creative
imagination and building personal ties, we've cheated our  children and
our society in a far more critical way than we're  inclined to
understand."
</p><p>
I argue as well for an exercise of creative imagination on the part of
teachers.  If their language is informed with metaphor, they are  more
likely to break what Paulo Freire calls the "culture of silence,"  in this
case, the culture that marks so many bureaucracies.  Freire  describes the
development by Brazilian peasants of a "critical  discourse" that may
become a way of remaking their world.  They  began perceiving that the
better world to which they aspired was  being anticipated in their
imagination.  It was not a matter of  idealism, Freire insisted.
Imagination and conjecture about a  different world than the unjust one
that exists for so many are as  necessary to the transformation of reality
as a design is for a  craftsperson or an artisan.  And they may become, he
went on to say,  "a route to the invention of citizenship."
</p><p>
For Dewey, distinctive human projects could best be achieved by  means of
a "subtle, delicate, vivid and responsive art of  communication"; and
surely he meant the kind of communication  that is fundamentally
metaphorial, that opens to possibilities.  If  university-school
collaboration is to be significant, this should be  fundamental to what it
achieves.
