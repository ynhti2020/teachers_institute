Collaboration as Story Building</h2>
<font size="+1">by Colleeen M. Fairbanks</font>
</center><hr/>
Having participated in the development of collaborations between
universities and schools in different sites and across different states,
I have come to see collaboration as a kind of lived story, one that
unfolds but is rarely predictable.  By lived story, I mean something  on
the order of Jerome Bruner's definition: "human agents doing  things on
the basis of beliefs and desires, striving for goals, meeting  obstacles
which they best or which best them, all of this extended  over time"
(1992, p. 43).  Partnerships between people who have  complementary but
not necessarily identical aims or beliefs must  negotiate, compromise,
find consensus if they are to make goals and  meet them, if they are to
overcome the obstacles that their different  roles or the context puts in
their path.  When they succeed and their  story evolves along constructive
lines, each character in the story  learns at least as much as they have
bargained for and usually a  great deal more.
<p>
To illustrate how such partnerships between teachers from different
institutions grow and change, I want to sketch briefly the story of  one
school-based collaboration in which I took part and then to  discuss why
this partnership worked as it did, to the benefit, I think,  of both
participants.
</p><p>
For three years, I worked with the Saginaw (Michigan) public schools  in a
broad-based collaboration between the schools and the  University of
Michigan's Center for Educational Innovation through  Collaboration
(CEIC).  The institutional collaboration was aimed at the  exploration of
literacy, teaching, and teaming, and involved a number  of faculty and
graduate students in partnerships with teachers.  My  role consisted in
facilitating the CEIC's projects with the schools. In  addition, I also
established with my Saginaw colleagues individual  classroom projects
aimed at developing curriculum to encourage the  literacy learning of
students in the district.
</p><p>
When I started my work in Saginaw, about ninety miles from the  University
of Michigan campus, I could not have imagined the twists  and turns that
my life as full-time, school-based project coordinator  would take.  Nor,
I suspect, could Kathie Smith, a tenth grade English  teacher at Saginaw
High School, one of the city's two comprehensive  high schools.  My
initial activities consisted of acquainting myself  with the district's
language arts teachers and the projects currently  underway.  In October,
several of us attended a seminar in Detroit to  talk with other teachers
about our individual efforts at school reform  and to learn about what
others had begun in their own classrooms.   One of the sessions included
an example of a cross-age tutoring  project in Chicago.  As I recall it
now, it seems that Kathie and I were  struck by the same bolt of
lightning; we began planning, even during  the session, how we might do
something similar with Kathie's tenth  graders and one of the local
elementary schools.  This moment began  for us a year-long co-teaching
partnership that extended far beyond  the cross-school project we had
initially stumbled upon.
</p><p>
Our work together did not then just magically unfold.  It began with  a
mutual interest sparked by the opportunity to learn from other  teachers
and to explore what we might learn in our own context.   Kathie and I
discovered at that meeting, and in our subsequent work,  compatible
beliefs about teaching and learning as well as the means  by which we
could put our respective abilities to work for the  students at Saginaw
High. It helped immensely that the language arts  teachers in Kathie's
school district had been talking with their  university partners for some
time about their classrooms; university  academics had already shed the
image of remote outsiders with little  interest in the practicalities of
schools.  Both groups had committed  their energies to the prospect that
university/school collaborations  can and ought to be formed, not simply
to create a better  understanding across institutions, although this has
been one of their  outcomes.  We discovered that such partnerships enrich
the  individual activities we pursue in academic settings.  The
possibilities  that Kathie and I were privileged to explore came from such
commitments as well as from the time and resources that allowed us  to
collaborate.
</p><p>
As we planned and taught together, we learned a great deal from  each
other about our individual roles, our relationship with each  other and
our students, and the life of the classroom we built  together.  We made
our blunders together, and we celebrated our  successes over a beer at
Holly's Landing, a local pub.  Our original  plans for the cross-age
teaching project had to be scrapped, for  example, because we had planned
our visits to the elementary school  too close together and too close to
final exams in January.  After  thinking about the schedule over night,
Kathie came in the next  morning and explained what concerned her; we
changed the  schedule.  At the end of the year, as our students were
writing the  children's stories their elementary school partners would
illustrate,  we also both sat dumbstruck when Lee, our ne'er do well
student,  came into first period class asking to read the story he had
drafted,  "The Scarecrow who Scared the River Spotless." The previous day,
the  students had shared their story ideas for the children's book.  When
Lee's time came, he mumbled something barely coherent about a  scarecrow.
It was clear that he had made up this idea on the spot,  but the other
students in the class questioned, cajoled, and made  suggestions to him
about a plot he might use.  To the best of our  knowledge, it was the
first time Lee had actually completed a writing  task outside of school.
</p><p>
We also learned to reflect more deeply about our interactions with
students and the aims of our instruction by drawing upon our  individual
perspectives about classroom events.  I want to share a  planning session
between Kathie and me to illustrate how we worked  together, pushing each
other to find more effective means to build  our students' understanding
of texts and hence their own literate  abilities.  Our class had just
begun to read The Bluest Eye by Toni  Morrison, and Kathie and I were both
concerned that the students  were having difficulty following the
different narrative voices in this  complex novel.  "I like the idea of
having the students write about an  experience and talking about if you
would get more information if  you recalled that incident to somebody
else," Kathie began.  "What  kinds of information could someone else add?"
</p><p>
"Maybe we could use a school story since we're on 'Who am I in  school?'
You know, some kind of incident from school," I suggested.
</p><p>"We could model stories," Kathie said.
</p><p>
"Yeah, we could model one or two for them.  I remember a story  about
Gloria during recess.  It was hysterical," I responded thinking  about the
stories I might tell in class tomorrow.
</p><p>
"What do we want to do after that? Have them write in their  joumals?"
Kathie asked.
</p><p>
"Do we want them to just write the story in their journals, or do we  want
them to do bothÂ­write their story and discuss what the  differences
might be," I wondered.
</p><p>
"Do you think it would help to have them assume another character  in
their narration and write the same story from that point of view?  That's
exactly what the writer is doing."  Kathie was beginning to  visualize
what class will be like tomorrow.
</p><p>
"Yeah, that's great.  Then we can use their stories and have them tlk
about how each one is different," I responded.
</p><p>
In class the next day, Kathie told a story about a friend from high
school who got pregnant and had to give the baby up for adoption,  even
though she and the baby's father eventually married. It was a  sad and
poignant story, and the students responded with all kinds of  questions,
since most of the teenage girls they know who get  pregnant keep their
children. I also told my story about Gloria,  whose skirt fell off one day
during recess while we played dodge ball  on the school playground.  The
stories made a good pair, providing  the students with ideas for their own
stories.  They had more  difficulty with changing the narrative
perspective.  One student,  Lanette, however, did share a very funny story
about painting her  bangs with nail polish.  She captured beautifully her
mother's  irritation when she discovered Lanette's after-school
activities.  It  not only left the students rolling in the aisles but
provided a  wonderful example of perspective for them.
</p><p>
This kind of planning meeting had become familiar to us as we  negotiated
the curriculum amongst ourselves and our students.  By  the time we began
to plan for our unit "Who am I in school?," the  pattern of our
interactions had developed their own routines.  The  constructed nature of
our collaborative teaching, enacted through the  give-and-take of such
conversations, involved us both in new  activities with students and new
relationships between school and  university teachers.  We had, in
essence, established our own ways of  talking about the classrooms we
share, using our own shorthand that  no longer needed detailed
explanations.  Below the surface of our  talk, we had developed shared
assumptions, derived from both our  individual and collaborative
experiences.  We had generated a  collaborative view of reading, writing,
and the connections between  them as well as the importance of modeling,
sharing our lives with  students, and inviting students to share their
lives outside of school.
</p><p>
It is tempting to see Kathie's and my planning meeting as occurring
effortlessly.  Perhaps only Kathie and I can know how many  conversations
and classroom interactions took place to reach this  level of ease.
Judith Lindfors and Sarah Hudelson have described  collaborations as
"delicate balances." They suggest that successful  collaboration is
characterized by "its continuing and evolving nature;  its essential
dialogic character; and above all, its life within and  dependence upon a
relationship characterized by mutual trust, a  relationship simultaneously
affiliative and autonomous" (p. 3).  For  such relationships to occur,
university and school partners need time,  space, and the willingness to
explore classrooms together.  They need  not only to respect but also to
appreciate the expertise that each  person brings to the collective
effort, and they need to discover  amongst themselves the mutual interests
that will guide their work  together.  Sometimes, these interests reveal
themselves suddenly, as  happened with Kathie and me.  Other times,
interests accrue more  slowly. Like stories, each partnership has its own
plot, its own  characters, and its own evolution.
