The National Writing Project: A University-based Teacher-centered
Partnership Program</h2>
<font size="+1">by James Gray and Richard Sterling</font>
</center><hr/>
When the Bay Area Writing Project opened its doors to teachers in  the
summer of 1974, it offered teachers a program unlike any other  they had
experienced.  The BAWP vision, conceived by a small group  of classroom
teachers, faculty and administrators at UC Berkeley,  moved to improve
writing in the schools by creating a new model for  continuing education,
one that recognized the expertise, knowledge  and leadership potential of
classroom teachers.  We were prodded to  action by what we saw as the
failure of the profession to understand  that writing is fundamental to
learning.  We found this lack of  interest, this almost total neglect,
inexplicable.
<p>
New teachers were trained to teach reading but not writing.  Not a  single
university in the country offered a course on the teaching of  writing for
students in teacher training.  Little writing was going on  in the schools
and little was being written by students at home.   Federal research money
was available in the field of reading but not  in writing, and the Modern
Language Association, at its huge annual  conferences, scheduled no
sections on the teaching of writing.  An  academic whose field of interest
was rhetoric was frequently  regarded as a pariah by his colleagues.  If
in the schools there were  teachers who cared about teaching writing and
were successful, they  had learned on their own in the cauldron of their
classrooms.
</p><p>
More fundamentally, neither the universities nor the schools gave  any
serious attention to the continuing education of classroom  teachers.
Some schools offered teachers a staff development day at  the beginning of
each new school year.  After the coffee and  doughnuts, teachers would
gather to hear the annual speech, then go  to a favorite restaurant for a
long and enjoyable lunch, and at some  time in mid-afternoon reassemble
back at the school for department  meetings to decide who would get the
set of <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> the  first six weeks.  If there were
occasional workshops offered during  the school year, they usually focused
on particular school problems  (tardiness, behavior in the halls,
detecting lice in the hair) and  seldom, if ever, on the content of
methods of teaching.  In their  teacher education programs, universities
gave all of their attention to  programs that prepared students for
teaching credentials.  There  were no regular programs­except
continuing education and summer  school courses­for practicing
teachers.  The rare special programs  for teachers that universities might
offer, such as the National  Defense Education Act (NDEA) English
Institutes of the late 60s, were  all based on the traditional 'top-down'
summer school model:  the  professors spoke and the teachers­no
matter how successful or  informed they might have been­listened.  At
the end of the four or  six week summer programs, there was no attempt to
keep the  teachers involved, no plans for the teachers sharing what they
had  learned with other teachers, nothing!
</p><p>
And teachers sat at the bottom of the hierarchical totem pole of
educational policy makers.  Their voices were seldom asked for or  heard.
Decisions on curriculum, instruction and staffing were made  by those who
were not teaching in the classrooms­that is, school  board members,
school and district administrators, university  administrators, staff
members of county and state departments of  education.
</p><p>Those of us who planned the new Bay Area Writing Project were
determined to make a change­to do it better.
</p><p>
Doing it better meant turning past models and worn-out traditions  upside
down.  The changes that we made led to the birth and  extraordinary
success of th Bay Area Writing Project which in turn  led to its
replication across California and the entire country.  Over its
twenty-two year history the Writing Project has continued to evolve  and
refine itself as it continues to grow at the local site level,  statewide,
and nationally, yet the initial changes the Writing Project  made in the
early 70s are the changes we believe must still be made  in order to make
school reform possible and effective.
</p><p>
The Writing Project is basically one of teachers teaching teachers.  It
is one in which teachers come together regularly, year after year, in  a
variety of summer and school-year programs led by classroom  teachers who
have been trained by the writing project to talk to each  other about
teaching, about approaches that have worked, about  successful ways to
solve the problems teachers face.  It's a model  based on the assumption
that the best classroom teachers­and we  know they can be found in
all regions of the country­make the best  teachers of other teachers.
Such teachers are believable to other  teachers as no outside consultant
can ever be.  They know the  classrooms and they know the students and
they know the problems.   These Writing Project teacher teaching-teacher
programs have  captured the hearts of teachers all across the country.
Over 146,000  teachers each year now attend National Writing Project
programs,  and close to 1,250,000 teachers have participated in Writing
Project  programs since the BAWP offered its first program in the summer
of  1974.
</p><p>
Everything starts with the design and content of the Invitational  Summer
Institutes at the local NWP sites, the linchpin of all Writing  Project
programs.  Each institute is planned and coordinated by a  team, usually
one university and one classroom teacher.  But most of  the teaching is
done by the participating teachers, usually 25 per  institute, who have
been drawn from all levels of instruction,  elementary school through
university.  Each participant is scheduled  for one to two hours to
demonstrate an approach to teaching writing- -some actual practice that
the participant has had success with in his  or her classroom.  Most
participants have never been asked to do  anything like this before.
Keith Caldwell, a participant in the  project's first summer program,
asked the other teachers in his  school year workshops that followed the
Institute:  "How many of  you have ever been asked to demonstrate some
teaching practice to  other teachers?"  In 1974, and for many years to
come, not one hand  was raised.  In addition to the demonstration of
successful practices,  participants also write a great deal, choosing
varied forms and  subjects, and discussing their pieces in regularly
scheduled  editing/response groups.  Lastly, teachers read, discuss and
write  about key research and important works in the literature of the
field.
</p><p>
These teachers, all successful in their own classrooms, discover  quickly
that teaching teachers is not the same as teaching students.   After the
experience of a five-week Institute where they all have  witnessed and
participated in each other's trial run workshop, and  have participated in
one-on-one coaching sessions with other  teachers and the staff, most of
the teachers develop a good sense of  what it takes to become equally
successful as a teacher of other  teachers.
</p><p>
The summer institute is the Writing Project's first step toward
recognizing teachers' authority and expertise in the world of  teaching.
When the Writing Project asks teachers to demonstrate  what they know
about teaching writing, it is tapping knowledge from  practice, the single
most important resource to improve teaching and  learning in the nation's
schools and the one most ignored by the  education profession.  When we
train a corps of Teacher Consultants  we are acknowledging that successful
classroom teachers are the  profession's natural teacher educators.
</p><p>
This preparation of teacher leaders is reinforced in several ways:
</p><ul>
<li>Teachers quickly gain additional experience as teachers of teachers
when they conduct school year in-service programs, the basic  follow-up to
the summer institute.  These workshops are scheduled  as a series, and may
involve as many as ten Teacher-Consultants and  one Coordinator, an
experienced Teacher-Consultant, who helps the  staff plan and oversee
these programs.  As is the case with all  Writing Project programs,
attendance at these workshops is  voluntary.  The sessions are typically
three hours long, and give the  Teacher-Consultant and the audience of
teachers sufficient time to  discuss particular practices, time to do some
writing based on these  practice, and time to share their writings in
small editing/response  groups.
</li><li>As teachers conduct more of these workshops, their professional
careers take on added dimensions.  They become Teacher Consultant  staff
members of their local sites, part-time teacher educators as well  as
full-time classroom teachers, and as they are sought out as  workshop
presenters their voices are heard as leaders of the Writing  Project.
They make connections to other Teacher Consultants at their  own site and
beyond, establishing their own personal networks, and  often becoming
members of one or more of the well established  national networks of the
Writing Project, such as the Urban Sites  Network and the Rural Sites
Network.  Because the Writing Project  has developed this corps of well
prepared teacher leaders all across  the country, it is now commonplace
for many to be asked to serve by  other educational organizations, such as
the National Council of  Teachers of English, the National Board for
Professional Teaching  Standards, and state and national assessment and
reform programs.
</li><li>The summer institute turns teachers into writers, and for many
teachers the Writing Project's close attention to their personal and
professional writing becomes the most important experience of the
institute.  The opportunity to focus on their own writing for five
uninterrupted weeks, the assistance of feedback from fellow writers  in
the sessions of the editing/response groups, the reading of their
finished pieces to an appreciative institute audience, and the
publication of their best pieces in the annual anthology are activities
which take teachers to a new level of personal as well as professional
confidence.  They know now that they are not only successful  teachers of
writing but successful writers as well.  It is not surprising  then that
editing/response groups frequently continue long after the  summer
experience and become important follow-up programs of  the Writing
Project.
</li><li>The Writing Project has been a strong player in the nationwide
teacher research movement, and the Writing Project's  encouragement of
teacher research, more than any other project  activity, has helped break
down the walls that have traditonally  separated teaching and research,
teachers from researchers.   Teachers engaged in their own research
develop naturally a personal  interest in the field of research.  Teacher
researchers want to know  what, if anything, has been written related to
their areas of interest.   They regularly meet together with other
researchers to discuss their  reflections and insights, to compare
methodologies and to raise  questions.  They are no longer outsiders to
the world of research.   Now they are contributors to the field.
</li></ul>
Given the traditional paradigm for education research that has  prevailed
for so long, and the usual ways that new knowledge is  created,
acknowledged and disseminated, it is perhaps not surprising  that Writing
Projects have been opposed by some.  Indeed, the  Writing Project's zeal
in recognizing the expertise of our best  classroom teachers and
developing their place as leaders within the  world of professional
educators has been met with opposition by  many in academe, particularly
from researchers in the field of  writing.  Throughout the twenty-two
years of the Writing Project, we  have endured a steady stream of
criticism from some academics  while at the same time, ironically, other
academics are seeking to  bring in the Writing Project to their campuses.
And what we have  heard over the years is always a variation on the same
note, that is,  it is beyond belief that teachers could be recognized as
knowing  anything.  A sampling of what has been said:
<p>
"The Bay Area Writing Project is nothing but sophisticated  Show-and
Tell."
<br/>"The writing project is the blind leading the blind."
<br/>"Teachers not only don't know anything, but worse, they don't want  to
know anything."
<br/>"Teacher knowledge is just impressionistic."
<br/>"Those National Writing Project teachers don't know anything!"
<br/>"What those writing project teachers need is MY COURSE!"
</p><p>
It is not surprising that classroom teachers have been ignored if  those
who are recognized leaders make such comments.  Because we  continue to
hear such comments in the mid-90s as we once heard  them in the mid 70s,
it is likely that teacher-based reform  movements such as the Writing
Project will probably need additional  time for total acceptance.
</p><p>
The Writing Project has always believed that any effective effort to
improve teaching and learning must put classroom teachers at the  center.
It is in the classroom that the ultimate test of reform will  take place,
and, if changes are to succeed, they must be embraced by  our strongest
and best teachers.  Otherwise reform will go nowhere.
