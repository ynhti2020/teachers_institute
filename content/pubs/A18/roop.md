Teachers and Students Collaborating as "Makers"</h2>

Ten summers ago, I spent much of my vacation in a National Writing
Project (NWP) summer institute, an intensive five-week learning
experience bringing together teacher-leaders across disciplines and  grade
levels.  Like my colleagues, I was reputed to be a strong  teacher of
writing.  Unlike many, however, I saw myself as a serious  writer of poems
and essays from the outset.  Over the weeks, I  watched many of these
elementary, middle school, and high school  teachers revise their
identities­as they drafted, conferenced, read,  and revised essays,
stories, and poems, they became writers, too.  As  I wrote, I had an
unprecedented opportunity to reflect on the  relationship between my
writing life and my teaching life.  What  experiences had permitted me to
become a writer? What experiences  had discouraged so many of my
colleagues from writing, and why  were they willing to engage in it now?
Would it be possible to create  a successful classroom workshop based on
my own most positive  learning experiences, as well as the model embodied
in the summer  institute?
<p>
I returned to my high school classroom eager to refine my teaching
practice.  That fall, I was invited by my writing project director to
conduct several workshops for secondary teachers on the teaching of
poetry writing and reading.  Because of my summer institute  experience, I
knew better than to lecture at my colleagues; together,  we read and wrote
and reflected on reading, writing, and teaching  poetry.  With that
strategic nudge by the director, I permanently  revised my notion of
professional behavior­l was responsible for  sharing my learning with
my colleagues as well as with my students  and the larger community.
</p><p>
Five years later, I was named the director of the Oakland (MI)  Writing
Project, home of the summer institute that spurred my own  professional
growth.  In that capacity, I have been able to work  alongside other
teacher-learners (and their students) as they revise  their texts, their
practice, and often, their lives.  One such colleague,  Laura Schiller, is
collaborating with me as we explore the effects of  Writing Project
related experiences on teachers' lives.  Since Laura  participated in the
1992 summer institute, she has blossomed  professionally.  She and another
Writing Project teacher-consultant,  Kathleen Hayes-Parvin, brought
colleagues together to form a whole  language support group.  These
Southfield teachers planned and  conducted workshops and courses for other
district teachers and  administrators.  Because of their efforts, the
district was selected to  be a demonstration site for the Michigan English
Language Arts  Framework (MELAF) Project, a state standards effort.  Laura
Schiller  has published articles in <i>Changing Minds, Language Arts
Journal of  Michigan, and Language Arts,</i> and is completing a book
about her  own experiences teaching in a multicultural classroom.
</p><p>
Schiller identifies an experience with poetry during the summer  institute
as pivotal to her development:
</p><blockquote>You were talking about the way poems are like photographs,
pictures.  I was looking for a photograph of personal significance.  I
chose not to write about my husband­there could have been
ramifications­I could write about my grandmother.  She was dead;
what harm could there be? I didn't have any idea what I was  opening up.
It was a Pandora's box. I was closed out of her death­ she died when
I was nine.  This was something in my life that had  been left unresolved.
</blockquote>
The "photograph" she chose to write about was an image in her  memory.
Schiller describes the writing and rewriting of the poem as  a cathartic
experience.  She tells of locking herself in the family  study, then
writing and crying all afternoon.  She felt as though she  were finally
acknowledging her feelings.  "To this day, I cannot read  the poem without
crying," she says.  "I was given permission to be  affected when I am
reading; I allowed myself to feel more deeply."  Schiller notes that this
was the first time she ever wrote a poem or  something personally
significant.  Her previous experiences with  writing had been largely
informational and detached from personal  experience.
<p>
For Laura Schiller, the act of revision was the connection between
writing poetry and writing other genres.  Heidi Wilkins (then
co-director, currently principal of Walled Lake Elementary School)  and I
conferenced a number of times with her, bringing up issues of  audience,
purpose, and craft.  She also received extensive feedback  from her summer
institute response group.  Her poem, "My  Grandma's Arms," went through
about eleven drafts, beginning as  prose notes, then moving back and forth
from poetry to prose to  poetry.
</p><p>
That experience became emblematic for Schiller partly because it
represented an episode of risk-taking and experimentation.  She had
written in a genre she had never before attempted, had written her  way
into something deeply personal, had willingly drafted and  revised text
(some twenty draft pages), and had allowed the writing  of the poem to
spill out of "school" into her life.  
</p><p>
Schiller has continued to experiment with genre studies, and to  school
herself­and her sixth graders­in the art and craft of writing.
This winter, after visiting her poetry classroom, I was amazed to  receive
their insightful written responses to a difficult, three-page  poem on
mortality and transcendence I had recently completed.   Sara, a sixth
grade student, wrote in a letter:
</p><blockquote>The third time I read (the poem) over, I grasped it even
better, and  then all of the sudden, the moral sort of hit me.  My mind
staggered  a little, but I recovered quickly from the blow.  I found a
whole new  set of emotions in the poem.... The poem was not about Uncle
Rube,  or Luke, or Aunt Tillie.  It was about human beings, and how it's
the  faults that we have that make us so human.  Nobody ever reached
heaven without falling into a few potholes.  If that was the point you
were trying to get across, it worked.  It hit me like a slap in the face.
</blockquote>
Another of Schiller's classroom genre experiments during the 94-95  school
year was a memoir study.  Students read and wrote memoirs,  as did their
teacher.  Schiller critiqued her own efforts in a letter to  her
Southfield colleagues, after rereading a chapter of <i>Living  Between the
Lines</i>, a book by Lucy Calkins on the teaching of  literacy:
<blockquote>I never succeeded at getting my students to "pearlize," layer,
or grow  meaning from, their entries.  Our writers' notebooks consist
mostly of  separate incidents.  I now see my memoir, as well as many of my
students', did not succeed at clearly connecting the strands of  meaning
in life.  Before next year, I'll reread some memoirs and look  for ways
authors juxtapose moments and handle jumps in time.   [M]ost important,
I'll try to rewrite my own memoir.  My guess is,  my students' writing
next year will reflect my own growth.  If I can  do it, then I can coach
it.
</blockquote>
When teachers like Laura Schiller are invited to see themselves as
writers, they are being encouraged to tell, to tend, and to make their
own unique stories.  During summer institutes I've led, participants  have
talked about the risky but rewarding decision many writers  have claimed
to make: the decision to lead an examined life, paying  close attention to
what is seen, felt, heard, remembered, and  imagined. On occasion, I've
shared a passage from an essay, "Poems  Are Not Luxuries," by poet Audre
Lorde:
<blockquote>[Poetry] forms the quality of the light with which we
predicate our  hopes and dreams toward survival and change, first made
into  language, then into an idea, then into more tangible action.  Poetry
is  the way we help give name to the nameles so that it can be thought.
</blockquote>
Sometimes we've talked about and experimented with what I call
"transformations," the unsettling but important moves writers make  when
they take slices of life, whether tedious, painful, confusing, or
endearing, and imagine them "other," with different consequences,
chronologies, and dramatic shapes.  By experimenting with  possibility in
the seemingly safe context of a poem, story, or essay  we may learn to
experiment with possibility in our lives.  In writing  project summer
institutes, the composition and revision of texts  become the central
metaphor for making and revising our  professional and personal lives.
Writing projects effect change in  participants because they build
literate learning communities among  teachers where life narratives are
valued and sometimes  transformed into art.  Teachers placed in the role
of active learners  may imagine and empathize with their students.  Placed
in the role  of inquiring professionals teaching and learning with other
professionals, they begin to imagine rich professional lives filled with
colleagues who see themselves as learners, responsible to one  another.
Thus, workshop activities become exercises in imagination,  leading
participants toward empathic understanding of others­ students,
teachers, administrators, parents, and of course, authors­ and their
worlds.
<p>
In <i>Stories Lives Tell: Narrative and Dialogue in Education</i>, Carol
Witherell identifies two central reasons for the rich use of narrative  in
teaching and counseling: "One has to do with the coherence and the
ongoing autobiographical activity of the self, the other with the  power
of story and metaphor in human action and feeling."  NWP  sites around the
country understand and tap the power of the word- -written, read and
spoken­to mend the sometimes profound split  between learning and
teaching, between poetry and pedagogy,  between our personal and
professional lives.
