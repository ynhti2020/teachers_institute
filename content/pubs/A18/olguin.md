Empowering Students throught the Arts</h2>

In some schools and some classrooms, the arts are viewed as a  powerful
tool for stimulating students to investigate many ways of  knowing.
However, the arts in many schools have experienced  budget cuts because of
funding constraints and have become  marginalized in the curriculum. Yet
there are some classroom  teachers who maintain a commitment to the
inclusion of the arts in  their programs of instruction. These individuals
see the integration of  the arts as a vehicle for helping students develop
a more complete  and comprehensive understanding of the reality of their
world.
<p>
In my role as a clinical supervisor, I had the opportunity to work  with
two new teachers who had made a career change; both had  extensive
backgrounds in the arts. This teaching team was also  placed in a school
that had a diverse multicultural student  population. As the teachers
began to plan for instruction in their  classroom, it was decided that the
arts would be emphasized. It was  their belief that the arts could inform
the study of other subject  areas in the curriculum, could raise an
individual's self esteem, and  had the potential for developing the
critical thinking and creative  abilities of the students, as they
explored and learned about their  world.
</p><p>
The children of this classroom were engaged in activities that
incorporated the arts as both an instructional strategy and a  discipline.
Instruction in the visual arts was integrated daily. The  lessons the
students experienced taught them about the varied  techniques and mediums
used by famous artists, about style and  about art history. Ample time was
also given to children to practice  using the techniques they were
learning. Instruction helped the  children compare and contrast their own
work to the works of the  artists they were studying.  As their confidence
grew, the children  began to view themselves as artists, and began
referring to the  artists they were studying as if they were personal
friends.  They  began excitedly to anticipate the arts instruction. With
their  increased knowledge base, they also began to compare and contrast
the techniques and style of the various artists studied. Arts  instruction
in this classroom quickly became a means by which the  student began to
see themselves and the world around them.
</p><p>
They began to think critically about the quality of their own work.  They
also began to take more risks, learning from their mistakes,  resulting in
higher expectations for themselves.
</p><p>
The arts allowed the students from this multicultural setting to come
together in order to form a community of learners. They shared a  common
bond and interest and had many opportunities to observe  and discuss their
work and that of their peers. Their teachers learned  about the students'
interests and strengths and began to get a  glimpse of how the students
viewed themselves. As the teachers'  understanding grew, they learned that
inclusion of the arts as an  area of study had a larger purpose. The arts
had become the vehicle  that enhanced the development of the self esteem
of the students in  their classroom. They had created the conditions that
allowed the  students to develop the skills necessary to be problem
solvers and  critical thinkers. The development of these skills was
valuable  because of their application to the classroom and to their
lifetime  experiences. The teachers discovered the magic of empowering
their  students.
</p><p>
As I think about my return to the classroom, I find that this  experience
demonstrated the unlimited potential a strong arts  program has for
instruction and personal growth. It also offers a  rationale for increased
funding to the arts withn our schools. No  longer should the arts be
marginalized.  The arts are a powerful  approach for learning and knowing.
