Voices from the Classroom Collaboration from a Teacher's Perspective</h2>
<font size="+1">by Sharon Floyd</font>
</center><hr/>
After fifteen years in the same classroom at the same high school, I
began to experience symptoms of "teacher burnout." The affliction  occurs
when a teacher feels worn down by the press of daily  demands: too many
classes and too many students with too many  problems; too many papers to
read and too many reports to fill out  and submit; too many routine and
dispiriting conversations with  colleagues, administrators, and parents;
too many public reports  about what teachers and schools are doing wrong;
all too little time to  read new books or to reflect on what I was doing
in the classroom.   Teaching had been my calling since I was five years
old and I still  felt the call.  But the pressures and routines of
teaching had begun to  get me down.  When I walked into the classroom,
something vital  was missing, and I'm sure that my students were suffering
because  of the way that I was feeling.
<p>
In 1985, after a mid-semester teacher in-service (a service I had  come to
see as routine), one of my colleagues, Katherine Smith, told  me about two
university teachers and a presentation they had made  about
collaboration­about new ways for teachers across levels to  work with
one another on problems of teaching and learning.   Because of my state of
mind, I didn't think that these two people  would eventually change my
life inside the classroom to the extent  that they have: what did they
know about the students I taught or  the pressures I faced every day of my
professional and personal life?  But Kathy was so impressed that she began
to tell all of us who had  missed the session about a different way of
teaching and about  different ways to imagine our lives as teachers.
Because her  enthusiasm was contagious, all Saginaw Public Schools
secondary  language arts teachers were given the opportunity to attend a
workshop led by Jay Robinson and Patricia Lambert Stock.  This was  our
first introduction to programs offered through The University of
Michigan's Center for Educational Improvement through  Collaboration
(CEIC), which Robinson directed.  What came after was  more important than
any single workshop.
</p><p>
I came away from this initial workshop amazed by the freshness and
enthusiasm these university teachers exhibited and encouraged by  their
willingness to listen to us: to hear about our problems and to  attend to
our hopes and aspirations.  These early sessions, in which  we explored
our common understandings and identified problems of  teaching and
learning that we felt we could solve together, and in no  other way,
developed into several collaborative projects involving  the assessment
and teaching of writing and the place of writing  instruction in a broader
language arts curriculum.  In our initial work  together we encountered
differences of experience and perspective  that we had to negotiate and
resolve: the idea of working on various  projects with university
personnel was uncommon in these parts at  that time and many teachers were
apprehensive about getting  involved with the unknown.  But I was longing
for a change and  began to think, as time went on, that this just might be
it.
</p><p>
Our administrators supported our efforts.  Interested teachers were
released from class time to attend many day-long in-service sessions  in
which we met and worked with various professors and graduate  students
from the University of Michigan.  We were offered models  for authentic
assessment of student writing and were given practice  in "read arounds"
as a means of articulating standards for good  writing; we were offered
ideas for innovative and creative lessons.   The waywe were treated by
Jay, Patti, and their university  colleagues was very surprising to me and
to many of my colleagues.   We were not only treated as professionals but
as equals as well.   What we, as teachers, had learned and knew was always
valued;  what we had to say made a difference.  Our opinions counted.  If
we  desired change, it was up to us to effect it, working with but not
relying upon our university colleagues.
</p><p>
Our work together moved from the workshop to the classroom and  our
university colleagues sometimes taught with us.  We used  collaboration
extensively in planning and developing curriculum.  We  generated ideas in
our group planning sessions and tested them out  in our classrooms,
returning to group sessions to improve them; we  tried out new ways of
doing things which seemed valuable but had  gone stale.  I began to allow
my students more freedom to plan and  direct their learning and I was
pleased with the results.  Through a  new awareness, I began to let the
curriculum emerge and grow,  following the direction of my students'
interests.  The benefits of  involving students in collaborative work were
first made clear to me  when I decided to solicit their help in designing
the writing  assessment that would be required of all Saginaw students.
</p><p>
We teachers had been asked to come up with topics for a writing  prompt
that would challenge students and allow them to write freely  and honestly
(something that we did not find in state mandated tests  or national
models).  With my eleventh grade students, we took a  survey and
brainstormed ideas about issues that concern teens.   Many common issues
emerged­teen pregnancy, problems with  peers and with peer pressure,
problems with parents and other  adults, problems with school, issues of
alcohol and drug use and  abuse.  The issue that most students ranked as
number one,  however, somewhat to our surprise, was teenage stress.  The
students argued, persuasively, that in treating this issue, many  others
could be addressed because they were indeed stressful.  The  excitement
with which the students tackled this assignment was  unbelievable, perhaps
because they knew that their work would be  used in the design of a
writing assessment.  Maybe a fresh approach  was the answer.  I was
amazed.
</p><p>
From this initial exercise, I began to become convinced that the  interest
level of students increases as they are made partners in the  planning of
their own learning.  Similar lessons were to come from  the work we were
doing together as teachers.  Even though teachers  on the same faculty
teach the same subjects, none of us actually  knew what other colleagues
were doing in individual classrooms.   After collaborating with university
personnel, teachers began to see  the value of planning with each other,
sharing ideas that worked in  the classroom and brainstorming about issues
and problems that all  of us face.
</p><p>
Collaboration is the best thing that has happened to me in my  twenty-five
year teaching career.  It allowed the university to come  into my
classroom, providing access to materials and information  that enriched my
knowledge and re-directed my practice.  Work  with my university
colleagues gave me the push I needed to make  my teaching a viable and
valuable experience for my students.   Because of the collaborative
experiences that I have been a part of, I  am proud to be a teacher who
tries to make a difference in the lives  of my students; because of that
experience, I know I am not alone.
