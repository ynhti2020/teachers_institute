Learning Through Drama</h2>
<font size="+1">by Thomas R. Whitaker</font>
</center><hr/>
A few years ago I proposed to a seminar on "Contemporary American  Drama"
in the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute that we proceed as  a theater
workshop or amateur repertory group.  Only if we "inhabit"  the scripts in
that way, I said, could we discover their full theatrical  meanings.  To
our group of common readings we would add theater  games, improvisations,
and several stages of rehearsal.  The teachers  agreed, hoping with me
that our adult work, with exercises  developed by Viola Spolin and Joseph
Chaikin, and with plays by  David Mamet, Sam Shepard, Ntozake Shange,
Wallace Shawn,  Christopher Durang, and Jules Feiffer, could prove
applicable to their  classes ranging from kindergarten to 9th grade.
<p>
So we played "Passing and Receiving," "Molding the Object," "Part of a
Whole," "Mirror Exercise," and Open Theatre games in which  behaviors are
passed from one to another, transformed, and then  passed on.  We tried
"open" scripts to which the actors must bring  their own definitions of
character, situation, and subtext.  And we did  lots of scene analysis.
As we went along, we explored with the help  of James Luse from Long Wharf
Theatre some scenes from Shange's <i>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered
Suicide When the Rainbow is  Enuf</i>.  One of our final projects was part
of Feiffer's <i>Grown Ups</i>, which  I directed with two different casts.
I was particularly struck by the  ways in which an Asian-American and an
African-American teacher  allowed themselves to enter into attitudes and
body-language  appropriate to Feiffer's Jewish family.  "Non-traditional
casting"  seemed a way to discover community amid diversity.  The
teachers'  curriculum units ranged from "Recipes for Playmaking,"
"Improvisational Drama," and "'Come Alive' Social Studies" to "The
Amistad Affair: Problem Solving through Theater" and "Acting Up in
Contemporary Law." One of them, Bill Derry's "Melting Pot Theater:
Teaching for Cultural Understanding," offered a plan for several
classrooms to create a play about alien explorers who encounter the
cultures of Puerto Rico, Russia, and Ghana.
</p><p>As seminar leader I learned a good deal from that experience.  In
1993, therefore, I proposed that another group focus directly on
"Twentieth Century Multicultural Theater." Now I had an additional
objective that I chose not to make explicit: Could these teachers from
different racial backgrounds (six African-American, four
European-American, one Latino), some of whom seemed committed  to their
own traditions, become a coherent theatrical group? Could  their
role-playing of cultural diversity lead to a realization of their  own
deeper unity? And could our theater exercises and games help  us to move
toward the necessary trust, reciprocity, and openness to  change?
</p><p>
It was worth a try.  Along with our theater games and  improvisations with
"open" scripts, we started walking through  scenes from David Henry
Hwang's <i>As the Crow Flies</i> and other scripts  from Misha Berson's
anthology, <i>Between Worlds: Contemporary  Asian-American Plays</i>. We
then turned to problems of character and  action in August Wilson's <i>Ma
Rainey's Black Bottom</i>, and to the  thematic and stylistic variety in
George C. Wolfe's <i>The Colored  Museum</i>.  Then, supplementing our
scene-work with written  comments on characters and pages from a
director's notebook, we  entered international waters: Eduardo Machado's
<i>The Floating Island  Plays</i>, Derek Walcott's <i>Dream on Monkey
Mountain</i>, Wole Soyinka's <i>The Road</i>, and Percy Mtwa, Mbongeni
Ngema, and Barny Simon's <i>Woza Albert!</i> The high point of this
stretch came with Woza Albert!  ­a satirical/apocalyptic play,
composed through improvisation,  about Johannesburg life under Apartheid.
I led two people in a  reading and a walk-through of Scene 1, and then
asked them to  improvise the scene.  Then I divided the group into pairs,
asking  each to select a scene, find an analogous action or situation in
their  New Haven experience, and develop an improvisation based on that
local material.  We performed the "improvs" in sequence, with often
hilarious and sometimes poignant results.  Our <i>Woza Martin!</i>
included  an interracial team engaged in a drive-by shooting and a
collective  visit to Grove Cemetery to invoke the resurrection of  African
American heroes.
</p><p>
As the teachers completed their curriculum units on such topics as
"Multicultural Theater in Music," "Drama and African-American  Folktales,"
and "The Role of the African Playwright as a Griot," we  rehearsed four
longer projects.  Two teachers directed scenes from  Lorraine Hansberry's
A Raisin in the Sun and Wolfe's The Colored  Museum, while I directed
scenes from Machado's Broken Eggs and  Walcott's Dream on Monkey Mountain.
The cast for <i>A Raisin in the  Sun</i> was African-American; that for
<i>Dream on Monkey Mountain</i>, by  a reverse twist, was
European-American (a theatrically trained  teacher and I); and the casts
for <i>The Colored Museum</i> and <i>Broken  Eggs</i> were racially mixed.
In our final (and celebratory) performance  it was the long concluding
scene from <i>Broken Eggs</i> that most fully  realized my tacit objective
for the seminar.  Machado's rather  Chekhovian play about an alienated,
nostalgic, and dysfunctional  family of Cuban exiles in California is much
concerned with the  failure of community, the need to meet each other
across the social  and psychological distances we have created.  The play
ends  ambiguously, with recognitions of chronic escapism and addiction, a
weary acceptance of the past, and a very tenuous hope for the  future.
But it requires of its actors a group-work that had enabled us  to
complete our own movement toward a multi-racial community.   For us
<i>Broken Eggs</i> had indeed made a theatrical omelette.
</p><p>
I am sometimes asked why university professors would want to lead  a
seminar for teachers.  For me the answers have emerged from  seminars over
the years on such various topics as "The Process of  Writing," "American
Fiction," "The American Musical," and  "Contemporary American Poetry:
Expanding the Canon." We hope, no  doubt, to be of service to the teachers
and students in our  inner-cities.  We may see a chance to experiment with
fresh subjects  or pedagogical approaches.  And we welcome the opportunity
to  discuss our subject and our craft with other adults.  But very soon we
also discover that these teachers need a kind of professional  development
that acknowledges their ability to plan their own  courses of learning and
teaching­and that challenges them to carry  such plans to completion.
In the end we find such a seminar to be  exciting and invigorating for all
of us.  We learn from each other in  often surprising ways­about our
subjects, our approaches to  teaching, and the opportunities for community
in what is often an  alienating environment.  For me that seminar on
multicultural  theater, which required us all to risk ourselves in
creating a  community of role-players, brought to those answers a new
clarity  and a palpable force.
