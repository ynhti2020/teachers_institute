<h2>
On Common Ground: Learning Through the Arts</h2>
<font size="+1">by Thomas R. Whitaker</font>
</center><hr/>
We celebrate the publication of Number 5 of <i>On Common Ground</i> by
featuring on the cover Charles Demuth's poster-portrait <i>I Saw the
Figure 5 in Gold</i>, a superb instance of collaboration in the arts. This
number contains much more evidence that the arts are closely  related acts
of imagination. Maxine Greene, for example, when  commenting on the powers
of metaphor, refers to Wallace Stevens'  poem "The Man with the Blue
Guitar," in which an image derived  from Picasso's "The Old Guitarist"
becomes a symbol of poetic  activity. In Rosa Citlali Zamora's poem "A
Reader, a Writer," a writer  is "a person who paints" and a reader is one
"who sees the colorless  picture."  As a reader of this number you may
easily find or  construct yet other examples.  When I first saw the
<i>Collaborative  Quilt of Transformation</i> on which Helen Seigel
comments, I was  struck by how it  translates into visual terms the
"transformation"  exercises that can help theater groups discover their
unity in  diversity.
<p>
We have taken such collaboration and reciprocity as one of our  themes
because it leads into another: the learning that may occur  through our
study and practice of the arts. Some essays here offer  justifications for
such learning, or ask why the arts are nowadays so  often mistakenly
considered "frills" when we ought to rank them  among the "basics."  Other
essays speak of the kinds of learning   through the arts that university
school partnerships have attempted  and achieved. And we also present
instances of the art by students  that has emerged from such partnerships.
</p><p>
A third theme might best be put as questions: If the arts are  activities
of an imagination that precedes and transcends our "logical"  and
"factual" discourse, may they not help us to re-imagine what we  mean by
education? Can they provide us with means or media for a  badly needed
rethinking of education at every level? If so, can we  continue to regard
them as separate items in an established  curriculum? Shouldn't we place
them at the very heart of a newly  imagined course of study?
</p><h3>The Essays: Some Connections</h3>
<ul>
<li>In what ways are the arts central to learning? How can we bring  them
closer to the center of our educational practice?  Maxine  Greene, Scott
T. Massey, and Elliot W. Eisner offer three ways of  approaching those
questions. Maxine Greene shows us how the  "metaphor" and, more generally,
the "imagination" can orient us  toward possibility, toward meanings in
our experience that we have  not yet articulated, and toward the
realization of community in our  schools and in a democratic society. For
her, metaphorical thought is  important to students, to teachers, and to
educational reformers who  would implement some of the principles that
John Dewey laid down.  Scott T. Massey proposes that the arts are a
fundamental model for  knowing and learning, one that is increasingly
important for the  emerging "knowledgesociety." For him, the arts
constitute a major  "symbol system" and a field of creative inquiry that
should be  central to a new and integrated curriculum. Elliott W. Eisner
examines more closely the reasons why the arts are at present
marginalized in our schools. That is so, he concludes, because of
unrecognized prejudices about the nature of the mind that are  ingrained
in our culture and legitimized by our universities. He  proposes not just
a philosophical re-orientation but a significant  revision in college
admissions requirements.
</li><li>How can a university-school partnership encourage learning through
the arts? The cluster of pieces "From the New Haven Experience"  offers a
provocative sampling. Because <i>On Common Ground</i> was not  conceived
as a vehicle for promulgating the activities of the  Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute, we have made  few references to  them in previous
issues. This seems an appropriate time, however, to  look at selected
seminars that illustrate various approaches to the  arts. Jules David
Prown describes his seminars on the analysis of a  wide range of artifacts
as "fragments of history that embody the  culture that produced them."
Kent C. Bloomer tells how he has  introduced the nature of architecture to
teachers mainly from  primary and middle schools, enabling a variety of
interdisciplinary  projects, and setting the stage for collaboration on an
architectural  project in one of the schools. I lay out something of my
own  education as a seminar leader, emphasizing how the participatory
medium of theater can relate to some issues posed by our diverse  society.
Paul H. Fry and Jean E. Sutherland then recount their  experience with a
team effort at L. W. Beecher Elementary School,  through which a seminar
in lyric poetry led to an international fiesta  involving teachers,
administrators, children, and parents. We also  include a poem written by
Narkita Spearman during that project.
</li><li>How may works by a group of students be combined in a project that
uses photography, oil pastel, and mixed media collage, and that  provides
a vehicle for critical thinking, exploration, invention,
reinterpretation, and collaboration? <i>The Collaborative Quilt of
Transformation</i> created at Diamond Elementary School under the
leadership of Helen Seigel, Artist-in-the-Schools in the Santa Ana
Unified School District, is a striking example of such an effort. Helen
Seigel's account makes clear how artistic, conceptual, and social  values
played their roles in the complex process that produced the  quilt.
</li><li>What roles may dance programs play in school partnerships with
universities and artistic groups? Jill Beck and Marty Trujillo offer  two
quite different aswers, each emphasizing social as well as artistic
values. The Dallas/Fort Worth project that Jill Beck describes,  initiated
by the Dance Division at Southern Methodist University with  support from
the U.S. Department of Education's Fund for the  Improvement of
Postsecondary Education, involved undergraduates,  graduate students, and
faculty at the university level, partnerships  with the schools, after
school programs, and the development of a  multimedia CD-ROM. Here dance
was approached within a context  that includes history and geography, and
with attention to a variety  of analytical and performance skills. The
Saint Joseph Ballet  described by Marty Trujillo might seem more narrowly
focused upon  dance training, but it too is concerned with wider issues.
Making its  home in a Latino enclave in downtown Santa Ana, the Ballet is
supported by partnerships with school districts, businesses, and the
communities themselves, and a crucial link to the University of
California at Irvine. Its aim is to provide dance training to inner city
youths "as a means of preventing delinquency, building self-esteem,
teaching new skills, and ultimately changing their lives."
</li><li>
Several other essays deal with the art of writing and its relations to
learning and living. Even though "writing" has always been  recognized as
a "basic" subject, the teaching profession has long failed  to grasp its
fundamental relation to learning. James Gray and Richard  Sterling set
forth the specific response to that situation by the Bay  Area Writing
Project and describe its transformation into the  National Writing
Project. They make clear how the Writing Project  has encouraged the
preparation of teacher-leaders, turned teachers  into writers, and
promoted teacher research. And they offer it,  finally, as a model of
teacher-based reform. Laura J. Roop and Laura  Schiller, teacher-leaders
in the National Writing Project, amplify this  account by sharing their
own experiences. Each of them lets us see  how the process of writing
poetry can become both an occasion and a  metaphor "for making and
revising our professional and personal  lives."
</li><li>
Colleen M. Fairbanks, also concerned with writing as occasion and
metaphor, approaches this matter from another angle. She describes  her
work for the University of Michigan's Center for Educational  Innovation
in facilitating collaborations with the schools that were  aimed at the
exploration of literacy, teaching, and teaming. Her own  teaming with
Kathie Smith, an English teacher at Saginaw High  School, led to a cross
age and cross-school project in which the  writing and reading of stories
opened up larger questions of the  narrative forms of our lives for both
the students and the teachers.  Colleen Fairbanks has therefore come to
see collaboration itself "as a  kind of lived story."
</li><li>
Susan Pearson-Davis, moving from narrative to drama, offers a yet  more
expansive version of that kind of story. She recounts the  history of
Wrinkle Writing, which began with her directing of a stage  adaptation of
Madeleine L'Engle's <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>, developed into  a
relationship between the University of New Mexico Department of  Theatre
and Dance and elementary and secondary language arts  teachers (building
there on the Rio Grande Writing Project), and  resulted in an
intergenerational project that includes the professional  development of
teachers of playwriting, a portfolio competition and  special workshops
for their students, a performance troupe for  teachers who want intensive
immersion in drama, and the  showcasing of short works written and
performed by students who  have been in the performance troupe. This story
comes full circle  with Pearson-Davis's noting of the unexpected benefits
that the  collaboration has brought to faculty and students at the
University of  New Mexico in several programs.
</li><li>
The two pieces in our department "Voices from the Classroom" sum  up a
number of our continuing themes. Sharon Floyd sets forth her  revitalizing
experience, as a teacher of writing, in projects led by the  University of
Michigan's Center for Educational Improvement  through Collaboration.
Sharon A. Olguin describes her work with  artist-teachers who were
committed to the view that the arts can  inform the study of other
subjects, raise the students' self-esteem,  and develop their critical
thinking and creative abilities. 
</li><li>
Finally, the poem by Rosa Citlali Zamora, an eleven-year-old from
Albuquerque, New Mexico, succinctly traces writing and reading,  painting
and seeing, to their roots in our shared imagination.

<h3>The Images: Some Perspectives</h3>
The images in this issue remind us that art is a scene of collaboration
and learning. The cover and center-fold on which I've already  commented,
<i>The Figure 5 in Gold</i> and the <i>Collaborative Quilt of
Transformation</i>, may suggest the range. Along with the quilt we
reproduce on page 17 a detail by Octavio Iniquez of Grade 4 that
constitutes one moment in the process of imaginative transformation.
<p>
Elsewhere in these pages we juxtapose the work of professional  artists
with that of students. Maxine Greene's allusion to Stevens'  "The Man With
the Blue Guitar" might have called for Picasso's rather  sombre old
guitarist, but we have chosen instead, for pages 4 and 5,  two refreshing
images of music that may lead us to think about  teaching. Mary Cassatt's
<i>The Banjo Lesson</i> suggests a desirable  intimacy in the teaching
relation. (Indeed, a study for that painting is  entitled Two Sisters.)
Saroeun Sim's untitled work comes from a 3rd  grade class at Jackson
Elementary School in Santa Ana, California,  where Halinka Luangpraseut is
Artist-in-the-Schools.  This image  renders the linking power of music
through a guitar that completes  the evident circle of friendship and also
the formal design. We have  continued this theme, shifting both instrument
and gender, with  William Sidney Mount's <i>The Novice</i>, on page 28, a
painting that again  understands music to bring teacher and learners into
the same  charmed group.
</p><p>
Olivia Nam's <i>Sombreros</i>, on page 9, comes from a 5th grade class at
John F. Kennedy Elementary School, also in Santa Ana. Its bold  design,
with a hidden life in the averted figures and a radiant source  beyond the
mountains, seems to underline Elliott W. Eisner's  comments on a
marginalized vitality in our schools. Natalie Pedroza's  narrative
collage, <i>Building a Tree House Where We Can Play</i>, on page  26,
comes from a 4th grade class at Harvey Elementary School in  Santa Ana,
where Helen Seigel is also Artist-in-the-Schools. Its  images and its
medium harmonize with Colleen Fairbanks' account of  collaboration as "a
lived story." On page 30 we have included an  untitled piece by Huyva
Tanikawa from a first grade class at Jackson  Elementary School, which
offers a delightful tension between the  centered and the eccentric. And
the back cover features Sergio  Romano's <i>Stop! Save the Whales</i>,
which comes from a 3rd grade class  at Harvey Elementary School. Its title
explains the shouting boy and  the sea-mammals below, but the total design
is a joyous image of  youthful quest in the context of both nature and
society and an  instance of the role that art education can play in that
quest.
</p><p>
Other kinds of images also come from learning situations: on page 11,
<i>The Orrery</i>, a painting that Jules Prown has used as an example of
learning through material objects; on page 12, <i>Moresque</i> one of the
patterns that teachers were studying in Kent Bloomer's seminar on
architecture; on page 13, a photograph depicting a moment in our  New
Haven "improv" on <i>Woza Albert!</i>; and on page 19, a photograph  of
two young dancers from the Saint Joseph Ballet.
</p><p>
Finally, two images in this number, one drawn from  European-American
modernism and the other from a Native  American tradition, point both to
adjacent essays and to our larger  concerns. Josef Albers' woodcut
<i>Encircled</i>, on page 22, is a subtle  instance of how lines and
spaces can generate linkages, volumes, and  dynamic process a metaphor, if
we take it so, for the collaborative  movement itself. And the symbolic
sheld designed by Hyemeyohsts  Storm and painted by Karen Harris, on page
6, evokes the  understanding of the Plains People (set forth in
fascinating detail by  Storm's narratives in <i>Seven Arrows</i>) that art
is a shared questing and  teaching, a way of knowledge that leads us into
the great balancing  harmony of a universe that includes the entire family
of the Earth's  creatures.
