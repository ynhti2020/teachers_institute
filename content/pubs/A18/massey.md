The Arts as Knowing</h2>
<font size="+1">by Scott T. Massey</font>
</center><hr/>
The inclusion of the arts in the new national goals and standards
provides an excellent opportunity to reinvestigate the role of art in  the
process of learning.  More than simply achieving­at last­
admission into the pantheon of the "basic" school curriculum, the
inclusion of the arts in the national standards is an invitation to
teachers, specialists, artists, community leaders, and education
reformers to look more carefully at the arts as a form of cognition.
<p>
For the arts have significant structures which are often neglected in
favor of so-called "affective" qualities.  The arts are a powerful  symbol
system, like that of number and language; they are  multi-sensory and
engage multiple forms of intelligence; they  employ distinctive, non
linear forms of thinking and  problem-solving; and they create some of our
most powerful forms  of symbolic communication.
Indeed, new understandings of knowing and learning, and even new  economic
trends, are coming together to support the idea that the  arts are a
fundamental model of knowing and learning.  Far from  being peripheral to
the basic business of learning and knowing in  school, the arts embody
processes of thinking and learning that are  central to the new types of
"knowers" needed for the emerging  "knowledge society".  Viewed from this
vantage point, the arts may  not only join other subjects in the "core"
curriculum, but take a  central place.  In this essay, I would like to
sketch some of the  reasons for this claim.
</p><p>
Economic changes are perhaps the most obvious factors reshaping  education
at the present time.  It is now a commonplace to note that  American
schools are still basically organized on an industrial model  developed in
the last century to prepare people to work in the  industrial economy.  A
new economic order is now emerging,  however, and this economic order is
based on information and  knowledge, not on materials and manufacturing.
Aware of this,  American corporations have taken a leading role in
insisting on  restructuring schools to adapt them to the needs of the
emerging  "knowledge" economy and society. 
</p><p>
In <i>The Work of Nations</i>, Robert Reich argues that whatever one's job
title may be, there are now only three job functions that are
economically meaningful­routine production workers, in-person
service providers, and what he calls "symbol analysts."  Symbol  analysts
are the new workers of the knowledge economy, who create  value through
the analysis of symbols (information), the addition of  design, and the
creation of new ideas.  According to Reich, the work  of the symbol
analyst is the engine driving the new emerging global  economy.
</p><p>
The kind of skills needed by symbol analysts are quite different  from the
skills needed by the workers and managers of the  industrial era. The "new
basics" being demanded by the new  economy are skills that are centered in
design, communication, and  learning.  Walter Wriston, former CEO of
Citibank has written,  "information is the new raw material of wealth and
opportun-ity...sorting out opportunities from an overwhelming flow  of
information is now the prime responsibility of any good  management"
(<i>The Decline of Sovereignty</i>).  In other words, the  ability to
learn, to discern patterns, interest points, and other  qualities of
creative design are key skills for the information age.
</p><p>
From this brief sketch, we see that economic forces connected with  the
emerging knowledge society are creating a need for a "new  basics" for
schools.  These new basics are not simply higher-order  thinking skills
but different order thinking skills.  These skills relate  to
communication and design­to creating value through the creation  of
meaning­and this is at the heart of the creative process of the
arts.  Also fundamental in this new economic order is the ability to
continue to learn­to love learning­and again, the creative
process is  a basic model for continuous, highly-motivated learning.
</p><p>
Reflecting on learning carries us into the next area to look at new
understandings about the nature of knowledge.
</p><p>
For at least the past 400 years in the West, we have entertained the  view
that knowledge is stable, sequential, provable, and finite.  Sir  Isaiah
Berlin has given a succinct statement of this viewpoint in the <i> The
Crooked Timber of Humanity</i>.  According to Berlin, we have  believed
that "a) to all genuine questions there is one true answer  and one
only...b) that the true answers to such questions are in  principle
knowable; and  c) that these true answers cannot clash with  each
other...according to some they form a logical system each  ingredient of
which logically entails and is entailed by all the other  elements" (p.
209).  This view of knowledge has provided the  framework for thinking
about schools and curriculum.
</p><p>
Contrast with this view our new understandings of knowledge as a  dynamic,
changing system.  Instead of speaking of "knowledge", in  fact, it might
be better to speak of "knowing".  This emphasizes the  on-going activity
involved.  Instead of seeing knowledge as a  sequentially constructed
building based on a foundation of "basic"  truth and knowledge, we are now
realizing that knowledge is a  dynamic and ever-expanding field.  The
process of knowing, likewise,  is not a passive storage of information and
skill, but an active,  creative process.  Even in math and
science­the old bastions of  stable, building-block knowledge­we
find evidence of continuous  rethinking, re-drawing of conceptual lines,
and creative large-scale  revisions of the type described by Thomas Kuhn
in <i>The Structure of  Scientific Revolutions</i>.
</p><p>
In other areas, cognitive psychology is revealing to us more about  the
role of the mind in the active construction of knowledge and  experience.
We are just beginning to understand how dynamic the  relation between the
knower and the known truly is.  Information  theory and complexity theory
are also adding to the picture with  powerful new tools for understanding
systems that are not simple,  linear systems.  Learning and knowing are
themselves examples of  complex, non-linear systems, and we are just now
beginning to have  the conceptual tools to understand them appropriately.
</p><p>
The educational "bottom line" to all these new understandings about  the
nature of knowing is that the old academic categories about  subjects and
about curriculum construction no longer make sense.   The student of today
faces a vast universe of knowledge that is not  only larger in scale than
that of the past, but is also in a state of  dynamic change.  Knowledge is
growing exponentially, theories are  continuously reshaped, and cultures
and disciplines are intersecting  and interacting in new and unpredictable
ways.  It no longer makes  practical sense, nor is it intellectually sound
to approach the  curriculum as we have in the past.
</p><p>
Ernest Boyer recently said in this journal, "The truth is that the old
academic boxes do not fit the new intellectual questions.  Some of the
most exciting work going on in the academy today is in the  'hyphenated
disciplines'­in bioengineering and psycho-linguistics  and the
like­in what Michael Polanyi calls the 'overlapping academic
neighborhoods.'"
</p><p>
Boyer goes on to say, "During the coming decades, we will see a
fundamental reshaping of the typology of knowledge as profound as  that
which occurred i the nineteenth century....And wouldn't it be  tragic if a
nineteenth-century curriculum design continued to be  imposed on schools
at the very time scholars were redefining the  structure of knowledge for
the twenty-first century?... Wouldn't it be  exciting, as we move toward
the next century, if we would start to  rethink the nature of the new
knowledge that related not to the last  century but to the coming century?
How can we organize knowledge  in a way that seems to make it relevant and
powerful for students in  the days ahead? Wouldn't it be exciting if both
kindergarten teachers  and college professors could view knowledge using
understandable  categories that would be newly integrated and would spiral
upward  in common discourse?"  (Summer 1994, p.11).
</p><p>
This reshaping of the "typology of knowledge" that Boyer speaks of  will
include the arts.  The arts will be repositioned in the new  intellectual
landscape.  The opportunity now exists for the arts to  reexamine
themselves as a form of thinking and knowing, and to  assume a central
intellectual role in schools of the knowledge society.   The arts as a
creative process provide, I believe, a unique standpoint  for the
construction of a new curriculum that addresses the new  "basics" of the
knowledge society and is true  to the "new typology of  knowledge" to
which Boyer refers. 
</p><p>
I would add to Boyer's list of tantalizing questions, Wouldn't it be
exciting to include creative artists in the process of reshaping  schools?
Wouldn't it be exciting to design ways to incorporate the  arts and the
creative process of art-making into new, non-sequential  curricula that
are created proactively by teachers and students?   Wouldn't it be
exciting to rethink the nature of learning so that the  creative,
constructive process that we now see to be the basis of  knowing would
become dominant in the teaching and learning  process in schools?
Wouldn't it be exciting to shift our focus in  schools from "knowledge
transmission and storage" to "knowledge  understanding and
creation"­from knowledge <i>acquisition</i> to <i>generating and
creating</i> knowledge?
</p><p>
Looking at knowing as a creative, constructive process leads us to
consider how the arts themselves may be viewed as a form of  knowing.
</p><p>
To look at the arts as a fundamental form of knowing and learning is  to
look at the arts in a different way from that usually accepted.  Of
course, the arts may be approached validly from many different
perspectives.  On the one hand, the arts may be viewed as a formal
discipline or training to be given to develop individual, specialized
talents.  Programs that give a primary value to performance skills  focus
on this approach.  In addition, the arts may be viewed as  historical
artifacts that figure in a special history­the history of art;  they
may be viewed from the point of view of the many forms of  arts criticism
as the data for critical analysis as works of art; and  they may be viewed
as data and examples for the many different  theories of aesthetics that
have been developed.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the arts may be viewed as a symbol system­like
language and numbers are symbol systems­that has been created as  a
mode of knowing.  Number systems have been created to help us  describe
certain features of the world that are invisible without  numbers.
Language is another symbol system that has been created  to help us
delineate features of experience and the world.  Artistic  symbols are
another symbol system­non-verbal and  non mathematical­that
demarcate otherwise invisible features of  the world and our experience.
Symbols act like the contour lines of  the map maker to delineate features
of the world.  They stabilize, fix,  give direction and meaning to the
"blooming buzz" of experience.  A  subject comes to know through the act
of creating and manipulating  symbols in the mapping of experience.
</p><p>
From this perspective, the arts are a major symbol system and a  basic
form of knowing.  A work of art represents an artist's attempt  to map
some experience in forms that capture the essence of the  experience and
communicate it to others.  The artistic process, then,  is seen as a
continuous process of noticing, symbolization,  re-attending, and
revision.
</p><p>
At the classroom level, viewing the arts as a symbol system and form  of
knowing/learning would involve students in their own process of  noticing,
creating, viewing works of art, reflecting, and documenting  their own
process of experience and discovery.
</p><p>
Perhaps the best way to conclude is with a flight of fancy.  Lynn  Olson
has written in a recent issue of <i>Education Week</i> (November 2,  1994)
that "reformers not only have to reach large numbers of  schools and
teachers and citizens, they must also change people's  fundamental
conceptions of what good teaching and learning look  like."  Developing
this vision of how new schools will look is perhaps  the most difficult
barrier to real school reform.  The changes coming  for our economy, our
society, and our schools are hard to visualize.   But looking from the
vantage of the arts, let us imagine what schools  could be. 
</p><p>
Imagine schools in which works of art and other "worthy objects of
study" are made directly available to students as rich and  challenging
primary source materials for active investigations.   Imagine multimedia
and telecommunications making these resources  available instantly across
time and space for young people in schools.   Imagine these rich materials
being the "gateways" or "anchors" for  integrated curricula that help
students make connections among  ideas and disciplines.  Imagine an
on-going series of aesthetic  experiences permeating the learning process
and motivating  curiosity and discovery.  Imagine schools in which
teachers and  students collaborate in the design of the curricular
projects and  investigations that spiral out of the rich source materials
of the arts.   Imagine schools in which student work is itself regarded as
a "work  of art"­that is, student learning is grounded in creative
inquiry, then  artfully rendered into Process Portfolios that tell the
story of the  learner's journey with power and beauty.  Imagine schools
that  support reflection and real intellectual growth for their faculties,
and  which support students in reflecting  on their own work and growth.
Imagine schools that have broken the glass walls between the school  and
the community to become centers of learning through which  artists,
artworks from cultural organizations, researchers, academic  leaders and
other experts from science, math, history, business, etc.,  flow.
</p><p>
The Leonard Bernstein Center, a national research and development  center
that uses the arts and technology as a new approach to  learning, is
working to refine visions like this, and to translate such  visions into
reality.  Beginning with a five year research project in  one K-6 public
school (the Eakin School), the Bernstein Center is now  in the second
stage of design for its school programs.  Ten public  schools­from K
12­are involved in a two year project to develop  concrete models of
reform shaped by the Center's five core  strategies.  Experts in math and
science from Peabody College of  Vanderbilt University, artists from local
cultural institutions and  universities, top staff from Metro Nashville
Publi Schools are all  involved in planning and design for this project.
</p><p>
At the school level, each school has a Design Team of teachers,  parents,
and the principal who work to develop the overall plan for  the school.
Each school also has a Focus Classroom that receives  weekly in-class
consultation and support from Artistic Design  Consultants from the
Center.  From this two-year project, a national  network of like-minded
teachers and schools will be initiated, with  model curricula, assessment
tools, models for the use of art and  technology, and models for teacher
professional development and  reflection drawn from the work of these ten
schools. 
</p><p>
Leonard Bernstein knew the power of the arts to reach people and to
stimulate learning­he embodied and symbolizes this power.  The
Bernstein Center represents a magnificent opportunity to transmit
Bernstein's educational legacy into a living legacy for our schools.   The
new economic forces of the knowledge society and the new  understandings
of knowledge support a central role for the arts in  learning.  Leonard
Bernstein is the perfect symbol for catalyzing  these forces into a
coherent vision and action.  The Bernstein Center  is dedicated to this
mission.
