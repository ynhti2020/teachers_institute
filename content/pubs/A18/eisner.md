Why the Arts are Marginalized in Our Schools: One More Time</h2>
<font size="+1">by Elliot W. Eisner</font>
</center><hr/>
That one must make the case that students should be given  significant
opportunities to work within and to experience the arts is  itself a
telling commentary on our conception of education or on our  values.  Yet,
almost ceaselessly that case must be made­and more  often than not
unsuccessfully.  When push comes to shove, when  budgets are to be cut the
arts are among the  most likely candidates.   Given the fact that we build
palaces to house them, erect concert  halls to hear them, construct
theaters to see them, pay performers of  the arts fortunes to provide
them, why the discrepancy between our  out-of-school behavior and our
in-school priorities?
<p>One reason that we seldom entertain is that while we believe the arts
to be important, they are simply not well taught in school.  Most
elementary teachers know little about the arts and often trivialize  them
in their classrooms.  Parents sense this and vote with their feet;  they
want their children engaged in more substantive experiences in  school.
</p><p>
There may be some truth to this scenario, but it is a scenario that
applies as much to science, foreign languages, and math as it does to  the
arts.  Why then, if the arts are not unique in the level of quality  with
which they are taught, are they so vulnerable to budget cuts  and so low
on our educational priorities?
</p><p>
One reason is that the arts are not regarded as useful­pleasurable
yes, useful no.  Now utility is a notion that needs analysis.  Some
things are useful because they help you do things that are valuable­
like getting into college or a fine university.  For college admission,
arts courses have no such utilities.  In fact, courses in the arts are
liabilities for admission to some selective universities. For some
admission committees high transcripts that list courses in the arts
reveal that the aspiring candidate avoided "solid" courses and instead
opted for what I suppose could be called "gasses".  Other universities,
including my own, eliminate arts course grades when the committee
calculates grade point average.  A high school student who aspires to  be
a practicing artist and who receives A grades in all of his or her  arts
courses receives no credit for those courses when competing for
admission, but woe be the same student who gets a C in physics.   And
irony of ironies, the same university that ignores grades in the  arts at
the high school level confers degrees in the arts for students  on its own
campus.
</p><p>
The reason for the marginalization of the arts is, I think, related to a
deeply, but tacitly held conception of mind.  It is a conception of  mind
that is rooted in Plato's view of human enlightenment and in  the legacy
of the Enlightenment on our conception of rationality.  For  both Plato
and Descartes it was mathematics that was closest to God;  to really know,
one had to free one's self from the senses and,  instead, address what is
abstract, general, and timeless.  The arts by  contrast, are concret,
particular, and timely.  And to make matters  worse, they are emotional!
Genuine understanding depends upon  detached objectivity and it is such
understanding for which the  schools are responsible. In short, their
contribution to enlightenment  is marginal at best, at worst they are
misleading.  And, in any case,  they have little to do with rationality.
</p><p>
To make the arguments I have made is not to suggest that  educational
policy is made by people who consult Plato or Descartes  before deciding
what knowledge is of most worth.  No, the problem is  much deeper.  These
prejudices regarding the nature of mind are so  ingrained in our culture
that they are not recognized for what they  are, and should there be any
doubt, the university legitimizes them,  thus playing a major conservative
role in constraining the  possibilities of schooling.
</p><p>
Imagine, if you will, the consequences on the secondary and even the
elementary school curriculum if by some magic admission to  selective and
not so selective universities required a portfolio of  paintings, a video
tape of a dance improvisation, a collection of  poetry, a film of an
acting performance, or a tape of a recital.  I dare  say that if admission
to college required such submissions there  would be a riptide through the
grades that would flood even the  kindergarten.  What if, to continue this
mind experiment, the S.A.T.s  were also excized of their multiple choice
items in language and math  and instead assessed actual performance in the
arts.  Where then  would the arts be among our educational priorities?
</p><p>
The deep point that I am making is that the place of the arts in the
108,000 schools in America is not likely to significantly change  without
a reconception of what schools are for, what it is that  nurtures mind in
all of its splendid manifestations, and what  universities themselves must
change to open, rather than to  constrain, the education of our children.
This is a tall order, but it is  necessary.  Without a revision of the
possibilities of mind and the  potential of schooling we are likely to
continue to fiddle with the  chrome of education while employing a motor
that does not have the  capacity to get us where we want to go.  The time
has come to look  under the hood.
