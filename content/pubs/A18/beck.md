Partnering University Dance and the Schools</h2>
<font size="+1">by Jill Beck</font>
</center><hr/>
In 1994, the Dance Division at Southern Methodist University moved  to
establish collaborative partnerships with schools in the Dallas/Fort
Worth metroplex.  The impetus was a desire to help remedy the  isolation
of the university from the schools in its community, and to  devise an
innovative model that would achieve some of the national  goals for Arts
in Education.  With the assistance of funding from the  U.S. Department of
Education's Fund for the Improvement of  Postsecondary Education (FIPSE),
a three-year program was initiated  that linked the close study and
practice of dances to inquiry in areas  of social studies and humanities,
including history, cultural studies,  geography, and gender.
<p>
The project began with the selection of six population groups that are
important to the metroplex population, three of which would be the  focus
of research and pedagogical design in Year 1: Mexican,  Cajun-French, and
Vietnamese.  Experts in dances from each culture  were invited to SMU for
intensive workshops with undergraduate  and graduate students.  The
undergraduates, working in teams with  faculty or graduate students,
researched contextual information  about the dances.  What societal
classes danced? Why and where  were the dances performed? What currents of
international influence  do the dances reflect? What beliefs or values do
they reveal or  express? In answering such questions, university students
were  engaged both in gathering information related to the dances they
were practicing, and in analyzing the dances to find points of
intersection between that information and its artistic/cultural
expression.  
</p><p>
Initial partnerships with the schools were formed to share the  materials
and approach of the international study units.  Some of our  initiatives
welcomed children and teachers to SMU, and others  launched SMU students
and faculty into the schools.  Children's  Workshops were held at the
university, for groups of 50-200  children, with a focus on perceiving and
discussing meaning in  performed art.  Deaf and hearing-impaired students
represented  about 25 percent of the participants in the Workshops, and
they  excelled in "reading" the visual language of dance, in interpreting
meanings of complex sequences of physical expression.  SMU  professors
worked with teachers to develop preview guides and  questions that
teachers could use to prepare students for the  Workshops, and review
assignments (such as writing the story of a  dance) as follow-ups to the
visits.  
</p><p>
In another type of link, after-school programs were formulated with  area
teachers for grades 4-6 and taught by undergraduate and  graduate student
teams.  These programs integrated dance study  with practice in abilities
measured on the yearly TAAS tests (Texas  Assessment of Academic Skills)
and endorsed in the National  Standards for Arts in Education.  For
example, children read maps to  locate places and patterns of human
migration; they learned to apply  such spatial concepts as counter
clockwise, asymmetrical, and the  four cardinal directions.  They
memorized existing dances, created  original dances embedded with their
own intent and meaning, and  documented dances in the symbolic language of
dance notation.   They performed for their families and teachers, becoming
increasingly comfortable with speaking, explaining, dancing and  problem
solving in public.  
</p><p>
Teachers noticed positive changes in some stdents' self esteem, and  in
their readiness to participate more actively in their other classes.
Principals were pleased that the new dance program demonstrated  awareness
of important existing educational goals, and were  impressed by the
facility of dance in stimulating inquiry in a wide  array of subjects.
This feedback will be crucial to the SMU dance  program's future in the
schools; in the coming years dance is  projected to become an element of
regular social studies classes.   Dance in the schools will of course be
less likely to be cut when  budgets become tight, if it is integrated in
mandated curriculum.

Graduate students and faculty at SMU also turned their attention to  the
development of computer software that would preserve on  multimedia CD-ROM
all the research they had done on the context of  the different dances,
yet in a format that would allow future  students to continue to work
creatively.  We have settled on an  interactive software design that has
two main approaches to  learning.  The Main Road is a narrative spine that
takes the learner  through the history and cultural background of the
dance under  study, linking it to important information in the social
sciences and  humanities.  Within the Main Road, key words are underlined.
When  clicked on with the computer mouse, these words open up various
resources in text, graphics, dance notation, audio, maps, slides, and
video.  The data within the Main Road are beneficial to learners who
prefer linear learning but may wish to diverge from a strict path of
study to fulfill their curiosity in particular areas.  The second
environment accessed by the interface is the Resource Room.  A  collection
of "bins" of audio, visual, and text materials, it is a vehicle  for free
exploration of any topic on which the study unit touches.  A  key concepts
index facilitates the location of sources of information.   A workbench
area enables students to compile and organize their  own portfolios of
materials on a given theme.  In consultation with  teachers, one of the
important tasks in Year 2 will be adapting the CD  units for students of
different ages.
</p><p>
The FIPSE project has proven the applicability of much university
research to K-12 curricula.  It also demonstrates the appropriateness  of
the university community turning its attention to greater  community
problem solving, the rewards for which have been a  renewed excitement
about learning and a pride in education as a  vehicle for social progress.
The SMU/Dallas/Fort Worth arts  partnership is an important step in
envisioning and implementing  the vertical integration of education.
