The accumulated knowledge of the arts and sciences is a cultural  legacy
that ought to be the public property of a modern society.  Yet  recent
educational practices have promoted a condition of  hyper-specialization
and a professional sequestration of cultural  wisdom.  In the somewhat
strident words of Christopher Lasch, an  emergent "Aristocracy of talent .
. . lacks any acknowledgement of  reciprocal obligations between the
favored few and the multitude.   Although they are full of _compassion_
for the poor, they cannot be  said to subscribe to a theory of noblesse
oblige, which would imply a  willingness to make a direct and personal
contribution to the  public."<font size="-1"><b>1</b></font>

Architecture is a case in point.  Although many architects do have
compassion for lives of city dwellers, the study of architecture is
virtually non-existent in primary schools and treated only  occasionally
in secondary schools.  Coursework in architecture is very  limited as an
introductory subject in colleges, only to flourish as a  highly
professionalized five-year bachelor's or three-year master's  program in
approximately a hundred schools throughout the United  States.
Ironically, this elite educational system may be  over-producing the
number of professionals while avoiding an  immense constituency of persons
who are affected every day by a  world of rooms, buildings, streets,
monuments, and urban places, the  conditions of which go begging for some
form of lively public  discussion.  In fact, the nature of architecture,
like music, can be  taught as an open subject of inquiry rather than as a
closed  professional discipline at any level of education from
kindergarten  onward.

I led three seminars about architecture, mostly to primary and  middle
school teachers, within the Yale-New Haven Teachers  Institute.  All of
the teachers taught customary subjects such as  English, mathematics, and
social studies, while a few also taught  drama and painting.    None had
ever investigated architecture in a  classroom setting, but they soon
understood that their own "subjects"  provided some fundamental means of
observing and analyzing  aspects of public buildings and places.  And our
subordinate topic,  architectural ornament and public monumentality,
engaged  everyone's interests and expertise.

Several of the teachers, who were engaged in multi-cultural studies,
studied the typical plans of a mosque and the rhythmic patterns in
African flat-pattern ornament.  The plans of the mosques  demonstrated the
architectural power of decorated walls positioned  to face towards Mecca
and thus to define the domain of a people.   Examples of African
flat-pattern ornament also drew attention to  walls as architectural
tablets for cultural expression.  In many  African traditions the
importance of a decorated doorway to proclaim  the rites of entry,
possession, and exit illustrated the architectural  power of a threshold.
A drama instructor dramatized that liminal  condition in local American
architecture by asking his students to  write and perform a play that
included constructing a familiar front  door on the stage as a principal
character in a dialogue.

A mathematics and social studies teacher focused on the capitals  upon the
Greek columns gracing the entrance of her aging New  Haven school building
as ancient figures descended from the myths  that flourished at the dawn
of western society.  Another mathematics  teacher employed local church
steeples as vehicles for understanding  proportion and the relation of
buildings to the human body.  Her  students would measure their own bodies
and then, by counting the  number of bricks or clapboards commensurate
with their body  height, they would deduce the size of a church steeple
either by  direct observation or by overlaying "body units" upon a
photograph.   Besides providing the students with tools of measurement and
subdivision those exercises alerted the class to the architectural
profiles and civic dimensions of their hometown.
</p><p>
Another teacher, combining instruction in artwork and ethnic  history,
persuaded his students to construct an immense model of  the ancient Aztec
capital of Tenochtitlan.  He rolled out a piece of  paper approximately
five by twelve feet on the classroom floor and  asked everyone to
construct individual models of pyramids, houses,  palaces, or rivers to be
pasted onto the paper rug. It did not matter  that the students produced
huts that were occasionally bigger than  pyramids and rivers that might
turn out to be smaller than the  sidewalksÂ­or that most of their
families were from Puerto Rico  rather than Mexico.  What mattered was
their collective production,  from a hodgepodge of diagrams and
photographs, of a dazzling model  of a lost city that could be rolled up
like a rug and taken from one  schoolroom to another  as  a  proud
display  of  their architectural  knowledge and achievement.

One of the seminarians, Bill Derry, was a  teacher, librarian, and  media
expert who was about to be appointed Director of Library  Media for all of
the New Haven public schools.  Several months after  the seminar he
invited me to come look over a cramped little library  room in a local
elementary school.  Derry, school administrators,  potential donors, a
library consultant, and I met in what appeared to  be an ordinary
classroom overstuffed with books, furniture, and  cramped spaces for
reading and instruction.  At our next meeting I  included some graduate
students from the Yale School of  Architecture.  At this "extended"
seminar, the school_s principal  presented a wish list that included a
bowl of fish as an important  provision for the library.  Objections to
the fish as frivolous in light of  the library_s desperate needs faded
when the principal explained  that the young students might benefit from
seeing a colorful and  watery sign of life placed within the interior wall
so as to be visible  from the long, dark, and windowless corridor.  The
idea of the  fishbowl created the theme "fishing for knowledge." Other
walls were  broken open as doorways to additional space in adjacent
storage and  counseling areas.  Several Yale students volunteered to build
and  contribute new furniture embellished with wave patterns  reminiscent
of the sea.  Money, computers, rugs, and light fixtures  were donated by
banks and local industries with mounting  enthusiasm.  The first phase of
the library improvement and  expansion was completed as scheduled.

We need more such "linkages."  Forms of knowledge now sequestered  in
graduate professional programs can quite easily be experienced  and
basically understood by others, including the very young, if  there is a
direct and creative connection between individual teachers  from both
graduate and elementary schools.  While the  professionally educated
played an important role in our "extended"  seminar, so did the
"amateurs," who came to realize that a small  architectural project could
be as celebrative as it was practical.   Surely our public architecture
would be more exciting and pervasive  if it were linked to a constituency
cultivated in the subject.
