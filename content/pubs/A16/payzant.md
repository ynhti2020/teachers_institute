<h2>
New Legislation for New Partnerships</h2>

<hr/>
In March 31, 1994 President Clinton signed into law the <i>Goals 2000
Educate America Act</i>, and on October 20, 1994, he signed the bill
reauthorizing the <i>Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA)</i>.
It is now known as the <i>Improving America's Schools Act (IASA)</i>.
Taken together, these two pieces of legislation offer significant
potential to reform and dramatically improve the education of our
children.
<p>
Most significant is that this legislation focuses on raising the  academic
achievement of <i>all</i> students to a high level by supporting  states
and school districts as they establish high quality, challenging,  content
and performance standards for all students and align  curriculum, teaching
and assessments with their standards.   However, putting things in
legislation is one thing­achieving the goal  is quite another.
</p><p>
We believe that educators at all levels must be involved.   Universities
are one of the important partners in the implementation  of Goals 2000 and
the improvement of teaching and learning in our  schools.  Certainly the
education students receive at elementary and  secondary levels has a
profound effect on higher education.  It is a  national necessity that the
education children receive be radically  improved and the involvement of
higher education in the effort is in  the interest of its institutions,
the students they serve, and the nation  as a whole.
</p><p>
How can the universities be involved?  First, they can participate  with
educators, policy makers, parents and others engaged in the  development
of content and performance standards in core academic  areas.  These are
not to be confused with minimum competency  requirements of the past:
rather, these standards are to be  challenging and high quality, asking
all students to reach the level of  academic achievement now reached by
only our best students.  The  attainment of these standards by students
becomes a means of  accountability for schools, school districts, and
States.  To help States  in setting these standards, the U.S. Department
of Education, along  with other agencies and organizations, is supporting
the development  of model voluntary national standards in several academic
areas.
</p><p>
Following the lead of the National Council for the Teachers of
Mathematics, specialists in other academic disciplines, with broad­
based involvement of teachers, administrators, business, and the  general
public are currently developing voluntary standards in core  subjects,
including science, history, geography, foreign language, and  civics and
government.  Standards for the arts have already been  completed.
</p><p>
While we expect these voluntary standards to be helpful to States as  they
develop their own standards, the States have the authority to  adopt State
standards that can be even higher.  These standards will  guide what is
taught in schools.  Universities can provide substantial  assistance in
this effort through the participation of experts in the  academic
disciplines and teacher educators.
</p><p>
Second, universities may have responsibilities involved in the
development of state and local comprehensive reform plans. The
development of standards by States will be part of an overall
comprehensive plan for reform that will be put together by a broad  based
State panel. The Goals 2000 Act, in addressing the makeup of  the panel,
specifically mentions institutions of higher education. This  provides an
opportunity for representatives of university faculties to  play a major
role in the development of State plans and the academic  standards that
underlie the plan. It is difficult to overemphasize the  importance of
these standards, and the role that university  representatives can play in
helping to establish them.
</p><p>
Third, it is in the self interest of colleges and universities to pay
attention to the education their future students are receiving. Clearly,
better prepared students entering colleges, universities, and other
post­secondary institutions will demand more challenging curriculum
and programs. As schools improve, post­secondary institutions will
need to upgrade their courses and teaching as well. In addition, as
States begin to set standards for students in terms of what they  know and
are able to do, rather than the number of courses they  complete, and as
they design assessment systems that adequately  measure how well students
are meeting these standards, post­ secondary institutions will have
to develop new ways of evaluating  their applicants and designing programs
for them.
</p><p>
Fourth, there is a role for universities in local communities. The
development of comprehensive reform plans will also take place at
district and school levels­most Goals 2000 funds go to districts and
individual schools­and districts, like States, will utilize
broad­based  panels to develop those plans. Universities can play a
key role  through membership on these panels and providing assistance to
them. Panels will need information about research on teaching and
learning and ideas on how to translate State content standards into
curricula for use in the classroom. They will also need help in  building
and maintaining support for change. And schools and school  districts,
like States, will need guidance on how to reach out to and  work with the
many constituencies whose support they need in  order to carry out
meaningful change.
</p><p>
Fifth, universities will be important as they reform teacher training
programs to educate teachers who will lead the effort to help all
students reach high standards. A crucial component of bringing about
change in schools is making certain that teachers, administrators, and
other educators have the knowledge and skills they need in order to  bring
all students to high levels of achievement. This will require  increased
attention to both the content and pedagogy.  Both Goals  2000 and IASA
recognize the pivotal position that professional  development­both
pre­service and in­service­has in truly improving  our
schools. Goals 2000 does this in a unique way. Rather than  relying on
post­secondary institutions alone to provide professional
development, Goals 2000 sees this as a joint effort between local  school
districts and post­secondary institutions.
</p><p>
Goals 2000 provides funds to States for grants to local educational
agencies, in cooperation with institutions of higher education or
nonprofit organizations, for both pre­service and in­service
professional development. Note that in both cases it is the local
district that is the recipient of the funds. There are two reasons for
this. First, it is presumed that the district, in cooperation with its
teaching staff, is the organization best able to assess the needs of its
current staff and the knowledge and skills teachers it plans to hire  will
need. Second, it is the district and its schools that have the
responsibility to see to it that all children reach the levels of
performance in academic areas that have been established for them.
</p><p>
To meet that responsibility, districts and schools need to be able to
greatly influence the training of their current and future teaching
staffs. Therefore, Goals 2000 provides for the establishment of a
partnership between local districts and institutions of higher  education
in providing this professional development. This approach  is carried over
in the IASA that will provide substantial support for  professional
development, again linked to content standards in the  core academic
areas, whether established under Goals 2000, as we  expect many to be, or
otherwise established by States. The emphasis  on academic content, a key
factor in the IASA as well as in Goals  2000, encourages involvement of
academics in those various  disciplines as well as academics from schools
of education.
</p><p>
In summary, Goals 2000 and IASA mark a new approach toward  trying to
improve the education of children who are most at risk of  failure. In the
past, ESEA has sought to improve the education of  these children by
providing additional resources­money translated  into extra teachers,
materials, and support services­while having  little effect on the
regular school program. Chapter 1, for instance  ($6.3 billion in fiscal
year 1994), provides dollars to school districts  to support extra
educational services to children in schools with high  concentrations of
poor children.
</p><p>
These extra services have typically been primarily remedial  instruction
for children who are behind. Typically the served  children are removed
from their regular classroom for part of the  day to receive this extra
help. This approach usually does not seek to  change the basic program of
instruction that the children participate  in for most of the school day.
Instead, it seeks to supplement it.  The  "add­on" nature of this
method has led to development of a parallel  education system in many
districts, where Federal programs are  operated separately from the
regular school program and where  individual school faculties may have
little influence or control over  the special instruction the children
receive.   
</p><p>
Goals 2000 and the new IASA seek to change that.  The reform plans  that
Goals 2000 will support are not plans for use of Federal dollars  or for
Federal progams; they are plans that States, districts, and  schools will
use to bring all children to high levels of achievement,  combining State,
Federal, and local resources into a unified program  of instruction.
Rather than being an "add­on" program, IASA  becomes a source of
assistance so that all children will succeed in the  regular school
program.  Goals 2000 supports the development of  plans, including
standards and professional development and  IASA  helps States, districts,
and schools carry out those plans, but the  plans are for the entire
program of instruction, not for separate  Federally sponsored activities.
The goal is a formidable one­to  substantially reform teaching and
learning in every school in the  country not for the sake of reform, but
to bring all children to high  levels of achievement.
</p><p>
The reform will be comprehensive, not piecemeal, seeking to  improve all
aspects of the educational enterprise at once and  bringing them all into
alignment so all are mutually supportive of  one another.  Professional
development will be directly related to  instruction in the content areas;
parental involvement will be a major  component of each child's learning
to the higher standards; school  plans will be based on student
achievement; and assessment systems  will measure how well children are
learning the content they need to  master.  There will be substantial need
for help in both developing  these plans and carrying them out, and
universities are certainly  institutions that can provide the help.  Here
are a few suggestions on  how to begin.
</p><p>
­Contact the State education agency and the governor's office about
participating on the State panel and in the panel's activities.  This
participation is not limited to membership.  Panels have the large  and
very important task of establishing the State plan for reform and  will
need help from many sources in doing so.  This help will range  from the
technical areas of standards and assessment and use of  technology to
practical matters of organization and public  engagement.
</p><p>
­Determine which local districts plan to participate in Goals 2000
and  offer assistance in developing applications to be sent to the State.
If  the application involves preservice or in­service education, seek
to  become a partner with the district in its project.  If the application
is  to develop a local plan, get involved at the local and the school
level  in developing and carrying out the plan.
</p><p>
­Assemble information on content and per­	formance standards
and assessments that will be useful to State and local panels.  This  will
be a new area where many panel members will need help and  support.
</p><p>
­Express support for State and local efforts to establish high
standards in academic areas.  These academic standards are  sometimes
misunderstood as attempts to modify values parents  believe are important
for their children to hold.
</p><p>
Above all, it is important for all of us to become engaged in this
effort.  It is not an overstatement to say that the future is at stake.
While the goal of universal public education is central to America's
commitment to a high quality education  for all its children, it is also
imperative that all children become prepared to participate in a
high­skill, high­wage work force.  Over the past several years,
many  States and communities have made substantial steps at reform:
Goals 2000 makes the Federal government a partner in this effort.   We ask
everyone to join in.
