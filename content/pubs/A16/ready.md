Health Science Partnerships:  Preparing the Workforce for the
Twenty­First Century</h2>

<i>Project 3000 by 2000</i> is a campaign of the Association of American
Medical Colleges (AAMC) to increase the number of students in the
nation's 126 medical schools who are from racial and ethnic minority
groups under­represented in the medical profession.  Although the
Project officially began in 1991, it is best understood as a  continuation
and extension of work that has been going on for more  than 25 years. 
<p>
The initial push to make medical education accessible to students  from
all segments of our society was widely known as Project 75.  Until the
late 1960s, medical schools were highly segregated, with  the vast
majority of physicians in training being white men. Only  about three
percent of students were minorities, three­fourths of  whom attended
the two predominantly black medical schools­ Howard and Meharry. On
average, all other medical schools admitted  only one minority student
every two years. To address the injustice  of this situation and to
increase the number of minority physicians  who would be motivated to
address the severe health care needs of  many minority communities, the
federal government and private  foundations provided financial support to
medical schools to create  minority affairs offices, hire personnel to
recruit minority students,  develop educational enrichment programs for
minority college  students, implement affirmative action policies and
provide academic  support services for minority students once they were
enrolled. 
</p><p>
Although Project 75 did not reach its goal of enrolling minority  students
in numbers proportional to their representation in the  population at
large, the percentage of minorities among beginning  medical school
students in 1975 rose to nine percent.<font size="-1"><b>1</b></font>  Even
though  most of the programs established in the early 1970s remained in
place, minority enrollment would not advance beyond this level for  more
than fifteen years. During that period, the country's minority  population
continued to grow, resulting in more severe under­ representation in
1990 than in 1975. 
</p><p>
By 1978, it already had become clear that medical schools' continuing
efforts to increase minority enrollment were no longer working, so a
blue­ribbon task force of medical educators was convened to analyze
the problem and make recommendations. The task force found that  the
primary cause of stagnation in minority enrollment was an  inadequate
supply of well prepared minority applicants. Although  medical school
efforts begun during Project 75 were helpful and  necessary, they were far
from adequate. The task force  recommended that medical schools form
partnerships with the high  schools and colleges that are primarily
responsible for the academic  preparation of minority medical school
applicants of the future.  Although this recommendation was not widely
adopted at the time, it  is the fundamental tenet of <i>Project 3000 by
2000</i>.
</p><p>
The goal of <i><i>Project 3000 by 2000</i> </i> is that 3,000
under­represented  minority students should enter the nation's 126
medical schools each  year by the start of the next decade. This goal
simply updates to the  demographics of the 1990s what medical educators
had sought to  accomplish through Project 75. Before <i>Project 3000 by
2000</i> was  officially launched in the fall of 1991, research conducted
on the  actual and potential minority applicant pool confirmed the primary
conclusion of the 1978 Task Force.  If medical schools are to
substantially increase their minority enrollment, the size and degree  of
academic preparation of the minority applicant pool must be  dramatically
increased. To illustrate, approximately seventy percent  of medical
students have earned bachelor's degrees in either the life  sciences or
physical sciences.<font size="-1"><b>2</b></font>  In 1991, only 3,666
blacks, Hispanics  and American Indians earned bachelor's degrees in these
fields. That same year, 4,363 blacks, Hispanics and American Indians
applied to  medical school. To reach the goal of 3,000 minority students
entering  medical school each year, it is immediately clear that two
points  must be addressed: (1) the number of minority applicants needs to
be much larger; and (2) the number of minority students earning
bachelor's degrees from the primary feeder disciplines is insufficient  to
meet the needs of medical schools, let alone the many other  science and
health related fields in which minorities are equally
under­represented and needed. 
</p><p>
Moving further back in the educational continuum, we examined  data on the
science skills of white, black, and Hispanic 17­year­old  high
school seniors from the National Assessment of Education  Progress (NAEP).
Specifically, we looked at the percentage from each  of these groups who
could use specialized scientific data in problem  solving (NAEP level
350)­a skill level considered to be prerequisite  for doing
college­level science work. In 1990, only 1.5 percent of a
representative sample of black 17­year­olds and 2.1 percent of
Hispanic 17­year­olds had developed these skills, compared to
11.4  percent of whites of the same age. Combining this information with
census data on the number of white, black and Hispanic
17­year­olds  in the general population, we estimated that there
are approximately  354,000 white 17­year­olds with the skills
needed to study science  in college, compared to fewer than 9,000 blacks
and about 7,000  Hispanics. In fact, the numbers may actually be lower
than this, since  these estimates do not take into account the fact that
many 17­year­ olds (especially Hispanic and black) drop out of
school. 
</p><p>
Admittedly, these are rough estimates. But these data convinced us  that
any credible effort to significantly increase the number of  minority
applicants to medical school had to begin no later than the  start of high
school. Some studies have shown that summer academic  enrichment programs
sponsored by medical schools can be helpful,  as evidenced by the fact
that a relatively large number of former  participants eventually enrolled
in medical schools. Many programs  reinforce the motivation of already
well prepared students by  providing them with experiential learning
opportunities in medical  settings.  Although they make an important
contribution, no short­ term enrichment program can take the place of
a strong academic  high school curriculum and access to a good college.
Far too few  minority students have access to either. 
</p><p>
While the primary goal of <i>Project 3000 by 2000</i> is to increase
minority enrollment in medical schools, the means to achieving that
goal­harnessing the resources of the academic health centers to
improve learning opportunities for minority precollege and college
students­is no less important than the goal itself. <i>Project 3000
by  2000</i> calls on medical schools and affiliated teaching hospitals to
be  catalysts in their communities' efforts to improve the quality of
education especially in the sciences. The academic health centers in
which medical schools are based are often the largest enterprises in
their communities and the largest employers. Usually, they also are  the
institutions with the largest concentration of scientific resources­
human and material­in their communities. As such, they have both  the
means and the responsibility to enhance the quality of education
available to the young people of surrounding communities. Nowhere  is the
need greater than in predominantly minority school districts in  the
vicinity of many of the nation's major medical centers. 
</p><p>Since <i><i>Project 3000 by 2000</i> </i> officially began three years
ago, many  more medical schools are involved in a variety of educational
partnerships that include local school systems, predominantly  minority
community­based organizations, and undergraduate  colleges, many of
which are affiliated with the same universities in  which the medical
schools are based. What does each institution have  to gain from
participating in these minority student­focussed  partnerships?  
</p><p>
As already described, medical schools are committed to the goal of
increasing the number of minority physicians they train. However,  history
has shown that they cannot solve the problem of minority
under­representation by acting alone. Medical schools are dependent
upon undergraduate colleges and K­12 school systems to supply  them
with a sufficient number of well prepared applicants. An  increasing
number of medical schools are proving through their  actions that they are
willing to collaborate to increase the number of  minority students who
will be prepared not only for medical school,  but for many other
science­intensive fields, as well. 
</p><p>
While the name, <i>Project 3000 by 2000</i>, reflects a goal primarily of
interest to medical schools, other participants in these community
partnerships have their own goals that are congruent with those of  the
medical school. Other health professions' schools and  postgraduate
programs training scientific researchers are strongly  encouraged to join
in. Virtually all science and health related fields  face a common problem
of minority under­representation, and all  have important resources
that they can contribute to minority  focussed community partnerships. The
same is true for  undergraduate colleges. For example, relatively few
undergraduate  colleges can be satisfied with the degree to which they now
serve  minority students and minority communities, especially when it
comes to education in the sciences. If it were not for a small number  of
historically black colleges graduating a disproportionate number of
students with degrees in science, the already alarming scarcity of  black
and other minority bachelor's degree recipients in the sciences  would be
much worse. Producing minority graduates who go on to  medical school can
be one measure of an undergraduate college's  success but, of course, it
is by no means the only measure, or the  most important measure. However,
if a college agrees to participate  in the partnership and resolves to
take steps to better serve minority  students, not only will that college
likely produce more graduates  who become physicians, but also research
scientists, teachers,  dentists, etc. Local school systems also have much
to gain by  participating in health science partnerships. High school
educators  also want to see their graduates become successful in fields
such as  medicine. Not only would more "success stories" among their
graduates reflect well on the school system and the teachers working  in
it, but the success of graduates from a community's elementary  and
secondary schools is crucial to the long­term prosperity and
well­being of the community, itself. No single partner­not the
medical school, college, or school system­should be in a position to
dictate the goals or structure of a health science partnership. All  need
to hear each other's concerns and interests, and then agree to  work
together to achieve a series of related student achievement  goals. 
</p><p>
For example, a public college in a partnership may wish to set a goal  of
doubling the number of minority students that it graduates with  degrees
in biology. However, even after taking steps to improve its  own
curriculum and learning environment, it may find that reaching  this goal
would be impossible if feeder school systems do not provide  more minority
students who are well prepared in the sciences. One  or more school
systems might then agree to set a goal of graduating X  number of
additional minority students who have completed a  specific set of
rigorous courses, and who will achieve a certain  performance level on one
or more standardized tests. With  encouragement and assistance from the
medical school, a school  district may wish to pursue its goal by
establishing a rigorous  magnet or focus school for the health sciences.
The school district  might also propose to work with its college and
medical school  partners to improve the quality of science education at
all of the  middle schools and high schools. The college would agree to
assist the  school system in the areas of teacher in­service training
and  curriculum development. The medical school also would agree to
assist in these areas, as well as by providing high school biology
students interested in medicine with experiential learning  opportunities
in medical settings. A collaborating dental school  might agree to do the
same thing for students interested in dentistry.
</p><p>
Although a comprehensive partnership such as the hypothetical case  just
described does not yet exist, many of the components already  are in
place. Every medical school in the country has appointed a <i>Project 3000
by 2000</i> coordinator, whose job it is to develop  educational
partnerships that eventually should lead to increased  minority enrollment
in the medical school. Over fifty medical schools  have established
partnerships with magnet health science high  schools. Some leading
examples include the Gateway to Higher  Education Program, a partnership
of the Sophie Davis School of  Biomedical Education and the New York City
Public Schools, the  Baylor High Schools for Health Professions in Houston
and Mercedes, Texas, and the Hopkins/Dunbar Program in Baltimore.  Even
more  are working with school systems in science education partnerships in
which medical schools collaborate with school districts on basic issues
such as providing laboratory supplies, or by working on issues such  as
curriculum development or providing teachers with laboratory  research
opportunities during the summer. Medical schools with  some of the more
extensive science education partnerships with K­12  school systems
include Baylor College of Medicine, the University of  California at San
Francisco, the University of Kentucky and Boston  University School of
Medicine. Through such partnerships medical  schools are helping to
improve the quality of science education  available to students of all
racial and ethnic backgrounds.
</p><p>
Partly as a result of the support given to <i>Project 3000 by 2000</i> by
medical school leadership, the number of under­represented  minority
students entering medical schools has increased 27 percent  in three
years. This enrollment gain was facilitated by a 40 percent  increase in
minority applicants, a rate of growth that slightly  exceeded that of the
applicant pool as a whole. Where are the  additional minority applicants
coming from? Since many of the  partnerships developed under <i>Project
3000 by 2000</i> are new, one  has to point to other reasons for the
increase in well­prepared  applicants. It is likely that some of the
educational reforms of the  1980s, such as encouraging all high school
students to take high level  mathematics and science courses, are
beginning to show results. Also,  major investments made during the past
decade by the National  Science Foundation in minority­focussed
science education programs  like the Alliances for Minority Participation
are probably helping, as  are programs from the National Institutes of
Health (e.g., the Science  Education Partnership Awards), ongoing programs
of the Bureau of  Health Professions of the Public Health Service, and the
Eisenhower  grants of the Department of Education. 
</p><p>
For a variety of reasons, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded  to
minorities in the sciences has risen sharply in the past few years.
Through <i>Project 3000 by 2000</i>, medical schools intend to contribute
to the continued improvement in minority student achievement in  the
sciences and health. Medical schools and teaching hospitals will  offer
hands­on learning opportunities to more minority students,  work to
ensure that students from all backgrounds know what  opportunities exist
in medicine, and endeavor to provide students  from diverse backgrounds
with access to those opportunities  whenever possible.  In conjunction
with similar activities sponsored  by other professions, medical educators
will demonstrate to students  who might otherwise be discouraged that the
difficult academic  lessons of school are important and relevant to their
one day  entering a satisfying professional career.
</p><h3>Notes</h3>
1. In 1975, sixteen percent of the U.S. population was black,
Mexican-American, mainland Puerto Rican or American Indian.  In 1994,
these four groups make up 20 percent of the population
<p>
2. Most medical schools strongly encourage applicants with broad
educational backgrounds in the arts and humanities.  However, because of
the extensive science content in the medical school curriculum and many
medical schools' prerequisite course requirements, most medical school
applicants and matriculants have earned bachelors degrees in the sciences.
