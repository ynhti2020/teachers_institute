<h2>
Building Partnerships with Business</h2>

Back in the mid­eighties, I served on a National Commission on
Vocational Education created by the U.S. Department of Education.  It  was
a follow­up on the group that had produced A Nation at Risk.   We
were tasked to look at how vocational education was serving the  large
numbers of young people who do not go on to college, and how  education
could improve its efforts in this field.  As part of our work  we visited
many different vocational programs across the country.
<p>
One of the most memorable moments of that experience for me was a  visit
to the Skyline Center in Dallas.  At that time it had a national
reputation as a high school of the highest quality that required every
student to take vocational education.  A very high percentage of its
graduates went on to the best colleges and universities in the  country,
but all students had to immerse themselves in projects that  taught them
the value of creative manual skills.
</p><p>
I remember having lunch with a group of such students during our  visit.
One of them, a boy with combined SAT's of l550 and an  acceptance at
Harvard, was telling me about his project.  He and  several others had
spent the past year building a full­size, two­ passenger plane.
I will never forget how he summed up that  experience:  "It was the most
exciting and the most stimulating thing  that ever happened to me, and it
brought together everything I've  ever learned at school.  I now know what
learning is all about."
</p><p>
I have often thought about that meeting and those words.  Maybe  the
reason they had so much meaning for me is how they echoed  what I have
long believed about education.  We have been so  obsessed with content
instead of process, and we have so often  isolated the content in the
classroom from the context of adult life,  especially the life of work.
One of the most important tools needed  in adult life is the ability to
solve problems.  Not the least of the  subsets of that skill is relating
what we know to a larger context that  gives it meaning and relevance.  
</p><p>
Most children begin searching for academic relevance to their lives  as
they move into the middle­school years.  That is when many of  them
begin to question the value of the educational experience.  The  lucky
ones, who love learning for its own sake, aren't deterred when  the
curriculum doesn't seem relevant.  They excel in school anyway,  because
values and support systems at home have given them the  motivation to
succeed.  Two groups, however, frequently have  problems in schools where
memorizing and regurgitating data is the  norm and ultimately a serious
turn­off.
</p><p>
The first group is the obvious one­children who begin to demonstrate
deteriorating performance and skills, and become marginal students  as
they enter middle school.  For whatever reasons­home  environment,
health, poverty­they have fallen behind.  Trying to  relate what
happens in the classroom to what is happening outside  the school, they
see no connection, no relevance.  Why bother?
</p><p>
The second group of affected children may be less obvious to some
observers.  I'm referring to gifted children.  For all the success stories
about them, there are equally compelling stories about school  failures,
marked by isolation, belligerence and boredom.  The  literature suggests
that the boredom is usually the cause of the other  two.  Schools with
programs for these children manage to minimize  the problem, but in
Connecticut this year we have seen budget cuts  in several school
districts that closed down these programs.  
</p><p>
I have two very vivid memories about these groups.  The first goes  back
twenty years and it happened at Pratt &amp; Whitney.  We hired a  young man to
work on our jet engine assembly floor.  His task was to  work at the
bench, putting together a small sub­assembly for the  product.  The
instructions for the process were portrayed on a light  board in front of
him.  The instructions required eighth grade  reading level and he came to
us with a high school diploma from a  good suburban school.  It looked
like a great fit, but it wasn't.  Within  a day his foreman realized that
this young man could not read the  instructions.
</p><p>
We arranged to have his reading tested by a consultant at the local  high
school.  He tested at a fourth grade level.  We moved him out of  the
department into a lesser job, arranged for private tutoring, and  in four
months he was back to the original job, fully competent to  read the
instructions.  Now obviously a private tutor was a big help  in getting
our friend up to speed, but I suggest that the connection  between
learning to read and a job was another big factor.  I  understand that
it's much harder to establish that kind of relevance  in the school, but
we need to make some sort of cooperative effort to  do so.  
</p><p>
That leads me to the second recollection on this issue.  Several years
ago, over lunch with a superintendent of schools, we got on the  subject
of gifted children.  He talked about how hard it was to  structure
meaningful experiences for them.  As he went on, we began  to explore how
business could help.  We saw many connections, but  both of us agreed that
we didn't want a haphazard kind of program.   We wanted a structured
approach that would be built into the  curriculum, grade by grade.
</p><p>
He arranged for me to meet with the math and science coordinators  in the
school system.  Would they be willing to let us have outlines of  the
science and math curricula in the middle and high schools?  We  would then
try to find work experiences in our labs and shops that  would match the
curricula.  We would also free up scientists and  engineers to come to the
schools to speak on relevant subjects.  Bus  trips could take the gifted
students to laser labs, sound and wind  tunnels, jet engine testing cells,
etc.
</p><p>
Both coordinators agreed to talk to faculty and get us the curricula
outlines we needed.  The meeting ended on a high note.  It never  regained
that lofty position of collaboration.  After several calls to  the
coordinators over four months time, with very little concrete  answers, I
asked the superintendent what was happening.  When he  got back to me a
few days later, he said, "The faculty have rejected  the idea.  They don't
want business messing with curricula."
</p><p>
What a lost opportunity.  How have we gotten to a situation where  there
is so little trust?  How can we improve things?  It seems to me  that in
the Yale­New Haven experience, there may be a kernel of  hope.
Perhaps what we need to do first is bring individuals from  business and
the schools together in a  common project.  For years  we have brought
vocational education teachers into our shops for the  summer.  Why not do
the same for middle­ and high­school teachers,  not simply to
give them a job, but rather to explore experiences that  could be woven
into high school curricula?  
</p><p>
My last thought is that college faculty could be facilitators in this
process, perhaps visiting the industrial setting with the teachers, and
working with them to create lesson plans.
</p><p>
As adults, most of us spend over half our waking hours at work.   Somehow
we need to let our youngsters in school know that work is  a very valuable
part of our life and that what they learn in school  has relevance to
their future lives.  We don't have to do this in an  exploitative way.
With the right kind of planning and collaboration,  we can make it a
creative learning experience.
