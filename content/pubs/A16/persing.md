<h2>
The Role of Apprenticeship Programs</h2>
<p><font size="+1">by Thomas E. Persing</font>

<hr/>
The graduates of secondary schools and universities in the United  States
are competing in the global work market.  We must establish  new
partnerships between universities, schools, and business which  will
enable U.S. citizens to be more successful, especially in their  early
formative and competitive ages of 16 to 23.  Currently there is  a
perilous transition from school to career.  If we forge new  relationships
between universities, school, and business which are  designed to break
the established habit of having sixteen­year­olds  become part
of the hamburger flippers of the USA and then waiting  to mature seven or
eight years before getting a real job, or of  disregarding the 50 percent
who enter college and fail to graduate,  we will have found a way to
dramatically improve the economic  health of the USA.
<p>
In this respect, not all First World countries function the same.
Germany, to cite only one example, has a different education/work
partnership.  From the outset, let me hasten to say, I am not  proposing
that the United States adopt what has been happening in  Germany for over
a hundred years.  Our culture would need to adapt,  not simply adopt.  
</p><p>
All students in Germany attend elementary schools K­4 or K­6.
They  then enter into one of three different types of middle or secondary
schools.  To the <i>Gymnasium</i> go the most academically able students,
based on tests and teacher recommendations, to prepare for entrance  into
the University.  Those who are very capable academically and  also have
practical skills and interests other than medicine, law,  government and
the like, enter the <i>Realschule</i>, which is composed of  grades
7­13.  The <i>Realschule</i> specializes in either commercial or
technical fields.  The least academically talented enter the
<i>Hauptschule</i> which is not viewed as not having an advantage when
entering the labor market.  
</p><p>
Despite these differences in aim, all three secondary schools have a
common core of academic subjects.  What is more, German  universities have
a much more narrow curriculum overview.   Students receive l3 years of
secondary education, which is a broad,  liberal, and general education.
They are admitted directly into  chemistry or sociology departments and
also into medical and legal  studies.
</p><p>
Using this as an introduction, I would like to focus on one aspect of  the
German education system as something the United States could  adapt and
adopt.  This is the Apprenticeship Program or Dual System,  which is a
combination of apprenticeship with part­time vocational  schooling.
This system requires a joint effort of business,  government, unions, and
chambers (<i>Handwerkskammer</i> and <i>Industrie­und
Handleskammer</i>), which are employers' organizations.   The
Apprenticeship Program is recognized as the true source of a  skilled
workforce which sustains Germany's international  competitiveness.
</p><p>
Students entering the <i>Realschule</i> or the <i>Hauptschule</i> can
become  directly involved in preparing for a career by becoming
apprentices.   The student will attend school for one or two days per
week, and will  receive on­the­job training three or four days
per week.  The student  will be paid about $3,000 the first year, $5,000
the second year, and  about $7,000 the last year.  All salaries are paid
by the employer.   The student becomes more productive each year, but
fundamentally  it is the skilled training which is the purpose of the
apprenticeship.   This type of investment by the employer is not rewarded
until after  graduation, which is the l3th year.  
</p><p>
The academic education is geared toward applied subjects which  have a
direct bearing on the career being pursued by the  apprenticeship.  The
curriculum is a result of cooperation among  business, labor unions,
government, and chambers.  Furthermore, the  apprenticeship is under the
tutelage of a master who will determine  when the apprenticeship may take
the test which will signal his  opportunity to become a craftsman.
</p><p>
It is important to know that there is always the opportunity for an
apprentice to take the examination and secure an arbiter which is
necessary for entrance into a University.  Also, many of the owners  of
small businesses, and CEO's in large business are graduates of the
apprenticeship system. 
</p><p>
In the United States, the university establishment could play an
important leadership role by using its influence to persuade business
leaders, the government, the educational community, and labor  unions to
cooperate and create an apprenticeship program in the  United States.
</p><p>
The key features of an apprenticeship system as proposed by  Stephen
Hamilton in his book <i>Apprenticeship for Adulthood</i> are as  follows:
</p><ul>
<li>Workplaces and other community settings are exploited as learning
environments;
</li><li>work experience is linked to academic learning;
</li><li>youth are simultaneously workers with real responsibilities and
learners; and,
</li><li>close relationships are fostered between youth and adult mentors.  
</li></ul>
Secretary of  Labor Robert Reich and Secretary of Education Richard  Riley
have already demonstrated their desire to move forward on  this
proposition.  One could easily imagine how this proposal could be
accelerated if a prestigious university such as Yale would openly  embrace
the concept.  The University has nothing to lose but can  advance its
reputation as a concerned member of the economic web  which weaves
opportunities for the less academically, socially, and  financially
advantaged members of the future work force.  The  University will not
have any competition from the apprenticeship  crowd that would lessen its
enrollment capacity.  However, lending  its leadership and commitment to
the apprenticeship model would  greatly influence business and government
officials to look more  seriously toward the establishment of an
apprenticeship system in  the United States.
<p>
An American business which is geared to monthly progress reports  and
quarterly earning reports, which innately distrusts young people  as
workers and has great difficulty with long­term investments, will
need the encouragement of tax incentives.  The University could help
influence the government to help realize this necessity.
</p><p>
More to the point, universities could create new relationships with
secondary schools by preparing teachers to teach the application  aspects
of math and science.  Teachers in current service could  attend workshops
and staff development courses to foster an in­ depth knowledge of
what must be necessary to be successful in the  world of work.
</p><p>
Of more importance, universities, business and secondary schools  could
form partnerships in teaching and learning how all academic  subjects,
including math, science, history, and language study, could  be presented
and taught to secondary students in ways which would  show them immediate
practical applications in various career  choices.  Partnerships of this
nature will break the mold of current  relationships.  New alliances based
on trust and respect will be  necessary.  I know of no entity that has the
respect of society other  than the University, that could better muster
these forces in a  cohesive and productive manner.  Following Robert
Kennedy's lead,  we should ask:  If not the university, then who?  If not
now, when?  
</p><p>
I fully recognize the virtual impossibility in a short paper of making
the reader cognizant of apprenticeship programs, the necessary  business
and government involvement, and the role of secondary  schools in the
preparation of youth for their transition into the world  of work.
However, I list a few references for those who wish to  become further
involved.
