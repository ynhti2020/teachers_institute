<h2>
Partnership as a Permanent Enterprise</h2>
<p><font size="+1">by Fred M. Hechinger</font>
</p></center><hr/>
<p>The Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute has three missions:  (1) to
give academic strength and vitality to New Haven's public schools,  (2) to
offer Yale's faculty a deeper insight into the nature of  American
education, its students, and its teachers, and (3) to spread  the idea of
such service as widely as possible to universities in cities  around the
country.  Together, those three goals truly add up to  Common Ground.
</p><p>
These were the issues discussed at the June 20, 1994 meeting of the
Institute's National Advisory Committee,  joined by Yale's President
Levin.  The discussion went beyond the three broad goals for the  building
of successful Yale­type university­schools cooperation to
underscore collegiality, teacher leadership, subject­matter focus,
institutional position on reform, and commitment to the long term.  
</p><p>
A serious flaw in both public and private funding of educational pilot
projects is the tendency to turn the spigot off as soon as there are
signs of initial success, and to move on to other, newer experiments.   It
should therefore be clearly understood, both by Yale and by  present and
potential funders, that the Yale­New Haven collaboration  is
not­repeat not­a pilot project:  it is a firmly established,
educationally proven enterprise.  It must be viewed as permanent­ an
educational way of life for Yale and the city schools.

But permanence can be achieved only if the financial base is sound.   And
while the Institute is on the way, it must still struggle to build  an
adequate endowment to insure both continuity and independence.   As Jim
Vivian put it, to be a persuasive model, it cannot afford to  have other
universities shrug:  "If Yale can't do it, how could we  possibly do it
elsewhere?" 
</p.></p><p>
Important, too, is the critical mass.  A partnership between school  and
campus can be considered successful only if it does more than  serve a few
teachers.  The goal should be to open up vistas of  intellectual
partnership to all who want to take part.  In New Haven,  about half of
the public school teachers have done so.
</p><p>
There is, however, another aspect of scale.  The Yale­New Haven
model works because the city is small enough to give Yale an  opportunity
to make an impact.  In larger cities cooperation may  have to be limited
to special areas in order not to dilute the effect.
</p><p>
Why is it important for Yale to succeed as a model?  The answer is,  as
Gordon Ambach pointed out, that throughout the country a great  void
exists between the public schools and the universities.   Even  where
there are limited contacts with the schools, largely through  the
universities' schools of education, there is no lasting bond  between the
universities and the schools. Most of the contacts that do  exist fail to
touch the hearts of either institution.
</p><p>
If other universities want to look to Yale as a model, what matters  are
not the details of the Institute's operations; what is crucial is the
understanding that, from the beginning, the relationship between the
university and the schools was regarded as a true partnership among
equals.  Public school teachers, who regularly get orders from above,
are understandably suspicious that the university professors may  come to
them as another superior force. 
</p><p>
The Yale­New Haven project works precisely because both
sides­the  teachers and the university faculty­know that they
can learn much  from each other.  The teachers want the benefit of
scholars to  strengthen their academic disciplines, the professors can
benefit a  great deal from witnessing the techniques of good teaching and
from  getting a first­hand view of what today's school­age
youngsters­soon  to be undergraduates­are really like.
</p><p>
President Levin stressed that, if the Yale example is to serve as a
successful model, it ought to be clear that it is easy to imitate the
structure and yet miss the vital point of the importance of the spirit  of
true cooperation.  He pledged that he would try to persuade his
presidential colleagues at other universities, especially in the cities,
that such partnerships deserve their serious attention.  As for his  own
bailiwick, he urged the Yale Corporation to endorse the  Institute's
permanent role as a unit of the university.  This took place  on September
23.
</p><p>
Equally important, if the Yale experience is to be replicated in other
cities and by other institutions, is the commitment of the arts and
science faculty as scholarly partners of the public school teachers.
This does not mean that the faculty of schools of education are to be
excluded, it does mean that the partnership, to be effective, should  not
merely involve education school staffs and the teachers.  Perhaps  it is
unfair to say that the New Haven program works so well because  Yale has
no school or even department of education, but it is true  that this
places the responsibility on the shoulders of the arts and  science
faculty.
</p><p>
I have had the privilege of serving on the advisory board of a  program
called "Stanford and the Schools."  It was a well­managed  effort
that has made valuable contributions in its own way.  But  because
Stanford University has a strong and highly regarded  Graduate School of
Education, it proved far more difficult­in fact,  nearly
impossible­to involve sufficient numbers of the university's  larger
academic community.  In addition, the outreach from the  university to six
school districts was largely limited to contact with  school
administrators rather than with individual teachers.
</p><p>
What the Yale experience and the deliberations of the National  Advisory
Committee make clear is that the university­school  partnership
cannot work unless it is taken seriously as a permanent  academic
enterprise, not as minor dabbling in doing good works at  the fringes.
The Yale model would not work without the  organization, planning and
fiscal realism of the Institute, the full­ time professional
leadership of James Vivian, and the enthusiastic  and tangible support by
the university's President. With these vital  conditions now firmly in
place, the Yale­New Haven Teachers  Institute is ready to serve as a
model for other universities and other  cities, and the many teachers
waiting to be admitted to a truly  professional partnership.
