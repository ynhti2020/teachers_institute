<h2>
Toward a New Vocational and Career Education</h2>
<p><font size="+1">by Edward C. Kisailus</font>

<hr/>
Education during the 1980s was reform­driven by the report entitled
"A Nation At Risk."  That report called upon university faculty and
school teachers to work together to enhance and update teachers'
knowledge, especially in science, math, and technology.  Since then  other
reports and national programs have provided frameworks for  curriculum
reform, student assessment, and most recently national  goals for
education.  These have become the standards for excellence  in education
in the 1990s.  Today these partnerships have taken the  lead to address
and change education to become more learner­ centered.
<p>
A new challenge faces American education and a new partner has  entered
the university­school partnership.  The new partner is  American
business.  The challenge is that the workplace is changing,  and these
changes are gradually rendering education, as traditionally  delivered,
more and more unconnected to what its graduates need to  know and how they
need to perform at work.
</p><p>
This newly forged partnership to include business raises some  questions:
1) What role should university­school partnerships play  in preparing
students for the world of work?, 2) How can business  join, or forge,
partnerships with universities and schools to assist in  this effort?, and
3) How in this context should we define vocational  and career education?
</p><p>
Schools and universities must continue to work together to design
education paradigms.  The new direction for education retains the  option
of post­secondary education for all students while they are at  ease
with the demands of real­world tasks, and equipped to continue
learning.  The present conflict between workplace preparation and
preparation for university education is being eliminated.  What then
should the role of the university­school partnership be in this
context?  Several recommendations can be made: 1) Subject area  content is
a critical mass of knowledge to be mastered and learned.   Pedagogic
issues must be opened to debate to make the classroom  more interactive
and student­learner centered.  2) Student outcomes  standards must
indicate their skill and knowledge levels.  Thus,  teachers' curriculum
and pedagogic skills and approaches need to be  appropriate to the
standards.  3) Teachers are expected to learn and  to be able to use the
current concepts and methods of the new  curriculum and technologies.
Innovative approaches, long­term  commitments, and sharing of
resources are critical to attain this goal.
</p><p>
What then is business' role in the  partnership, and how might
partnerships be joined or forged?  What  brings business into the
partnership is the near elimination of low­ skilled jobs and the
upgrading of middle­level jobs.  The rate of  change due to the
globalization of business and technological  advances limit the value of
current knowledge or skills.  Competition,  consumer demand, and
accelerated pace of change in combination  with the availability of
technology are pushing business to rethink  their workplace.  They are
restructuring to reflect the team concept­ modular organization, and
worker concerns for quality and pace of  work.  At the same time, more
advanced equipment or modern  procedures call for increased technical
skill, workers able to perform  a greater number of ever changing tasks,
and supervisors with a  fuller understanding of the whole product, and how
to meet  customers' needs.  Business enters the partnership with an
interest  to work to develop competencies from the shop floor to the
executive  suite.  The competencies include resource management,
interpersonal  skills, information management, systems interrelationships,
and  technology literacy.  The basic foundations for these competencies in
education begin with the basic skills related to content in  mathematics,
science, technology, reading, writing, listening, and  speaking; thinking
skills related to creativity, problem solving,  decision making,
reasoning, and knowledge how to learn; and,  personal skills developing
responsibility, self­esteem, sociability,  self­management,
integrity, and honesty.
</p><p>
Business brings to the  partnership its needs in terms of learner outcomes
or skills required.   Skill requirements change through time and the
demands of the  global information economy raise standards significantly
for workers.   American businesses need to reach a consensus on such
standards  and how to adapt to an ever changing environment.  They must
bring  this consensus to the partnership.  
</p><p>
How then in the context of the  university­school initiatives and the
consensus needs of business is  vocational education and career education
defined?  There are  models of instruction being explored in education
that are currently  practiced in industry.  These are
apprenticeship­like learning  experiences with students engaged in
hands­on, real investigations,  where they use a variety of means and
materials to solve problems,  engage in individual and group activity, and
rate students based on  intellectual strengths, subject interest, and
learning styles.  These  new directions in education have changed the
structure of the  classroom to a more learner­centered, group
interactive  environment.  Thus, conventional education is changing to
mirror the  aspects of the workplace changes driven by competitiveness and
technological revolution.  One may argue that this is the vocational
education of old that recognizes that learning by doing is more  effective
in connecting graduates' knowledge and what they need to  know to perform
at work.  The definitions of vocational education  and career education
then are becoming blurred with this new  paradigm of education. Narrow
training or task learning soon  becomes obsolete in the changing world.
Today properly taught  technical education has considerable academic
content and will have  even more in the future as higher theoretical and
conceptual skills  require. In the past, participation in vocational
education precluded  college attendance. Today attending college is not a
one­time only  decision.  The university­school­business
partners' objective should  be to stimulate academic achievement and
career readiness among  all students. Unlike the division of the past
between vocational  education and career education, a major objective of
the partnership  should be to foster lifelong learning for all.
