Creating New Paths to the Middle Class</h2>

<hr/>
A fault line runs through the American economy today that  threatens the
stability of our society:  the deep divide between  college­educated
workers and the nearly three­quarters of our  workforce whose
education ended with "school."  Never before in our  nation's history have
the economic prospects and experience of these  groups diverged so
dramatically.  In the not­too­distant past, both  college and
non­college educated workers could consider themselves  members of
the same­middle­class.  By 1979, the average male  college
graduate earned 49 percent more than his counterpart with a  high school
diploma alone.  By 1992, this divergence had widened to  83 percent.
Employment benefits such as health insurance and  pension coverage have
followed the same pattern. 
<p>
The evidence suggests that the forces contributing to this divergence
will intensify as our workforce faces an increasingly competitive,
technologically sophisticated global economy.  Opportunities for  workers
with more education and higher skills will continue to grow.   Options for
workers with less education and lower skill levels will  continue to
shrink.
</p><p>
Understandably, these Americans are deeply anxious about their  prospects
and those of their children.  The enormous growth in new  jobs­over 5
million since January 1993, primarily in the private  sector­does not
reassure them.  What they see most clearly is the  loss of
once­secure pathways to the middle class, not the gain of new  jobs.
But nostalgia for the more solid­seeming economy of the past  should
not lead us to conclude that the mourned lost jobs­in  traditional
manufacturing, for example­were inherently "middle  class." Rather,
in an economy in which wages for workers at all levels  were rising
steadily, even "lousy" jobs could eventually become good  ones.
</p><p>
Now what is urgently needed is not the reappearance of the old jobs,  but
the re­creation of career paths and upward mobility for less­
educated and less­skilled Americans. Manufacturing is still a
critical  industry in America's economy, but now the greatest value is
added,  not at the assembly line, but in the steps before and after the
product is produced­for instance, through market research, design
and engineering; just­in­time delivery, customized installation,
maintenance. To add value that commands high wages, a worker  must be able
to think, solve problems, and learn how to apply skills  in new contexts.
</p><p>
Building new paths to the middle class therefore requires that we
establish the common ground between secondary and postsecondary  education
and between "work" and "school." Neither the American  economy nor the
American workforce can prosper in an environment  that treats "schooling,"
"higher education," and "training" as separate­ even if
equal­entities.
</p><p>
The School­to­Work Opportunities Act, signed into law by
President  Clinton in May 1994, has revolutionary potential to revitalize,
restructure, and integrate these components. During the last two  years of
high school, and for at least one year beyond, young people  participating
in school­to­work programs receive classroom  experience and
on­the­job training. They may not know at any one  moment
whether they are receiving "schooling," "training," or "higher
education"­and it doesn't matter. What matters is that they are
forging meaningful and durable connections between the world of  work and
the world of school.
</p><p>
The process of establishing a national School­to­Work system is
already underway. In 1994 alone, the Departments of Labor and  Education
provided $53 million in grants to states and localities to  expand
promising school­to­work programs into functioning school­
to­work systems. While there are a variety of models for providing
successful school­to­work opportunities, they all have in common
the  integration of secondary schooling, post­secondary education,
training and employment.  And the implementation of specific
school­to­work programs requires that working relationships be
formed­and maintained­between and among partners from
education, business, and the community.
</p><p>As "work" and "school" mutually support and infuse each other, the  old
walls between "academic" and "vocational" education break down.   At one
school­to­work program I visited, I talked with a young  woman
who told me frankly that she "used to hate math." But now  her perspective
had changed. Math class, once a blizzard of abstract  equations, had
become a concrete way to build skills for a good job.  Now, she said, "I
love geometry."
</p><p>
The truly innovative nature of the school­to­work movement is
obvious from the collaborations that routinely occur between groups  that
have never worked together and are often mutually suspicious.  For
example, the partnership launching the New Haven Area  Initiative for
School­to­Work Opportunities­which focuses on the  area's
emerging biomedical industry­reaches deep and wide into the  greater
New Haven community. The partners include, among others,  the local
Private Industry Council, the New Haven Boards of  Education, the Science
Park Development Center, the Gateway Community­Technical College, and
the area Cooperative Education  Service. The initiative has also had
strong involvement from labor  and individual employers,
community­based organizations, Yale  University and Yale Medical
School.
</p><p>
What is so remarkable is the breadth of partners who perceive  themselves
as stakeholders in forming school­to­work arrangements.  In a
specific program, the entity responsible for initiating and  coordinating
a school­to­work project can range from the Greater  Austin
Chamber of Commerce and the Boston Private Industry  Council to the School
Board of Dade County, Florida, the Fond du Lac  Community College in
Minnesota, and Cornell University. An  individual locality can choose the
specific configuration that best fits  its specific needs.
</p><p>
Some linkages are forged out of the structure of the specific school­
to­work model. For example, "tech prep" programs­sometimes
called  two­plus­two, because they combine two years of high
school with  two years of college­by their nature require secondary
and post­ secondary schools to create a cohesive curriculum. The
process of  building such a school­to­work program forces
schools and colleges  to articulate both their common interests and their
unique roles.
</p><p>
Community colleges are proving especially adept at providing the
education and skills training that will sustain the core of the new
middle class jobs. A survey the Department of Labor conducted with  the
American Association of Community Colleges (AACC),  incorporating
responses from 460 community colleges nationwide  and representing over
115,300 students, revealed that the  community college degrees and
certificates most in demand by  employers correlate extremely well with
fields that the Bureau of  Labor Statistics has identified as most likely
to grow between now  and 2005. These include nursing (associate degree and
registered  nurse); computer information systems; medical technician and
allied  health jobs, such as physical therapy assistant; emergency medical
technician; radiology technician; occupational therapy assistant;
respiratory therapy; dental hygiene; biomedical technician; and  nuclear
medicine technician. Most of these jobs­all of which currently  pay
minimum average entry­level salaries of $20,000­require some
post­secondary education but generally do not demand four­year
degrees.
</p><p>
I recently had the opportunity to speak with community college  students
from across the country. These students were a varied and  determined
bunch. There were single parents pulling off the near­
impossible­working full­time, raising children and getting an
education. Their colleges were helping them with creative  adaptations
such as "tele­classes" that parents can watch on  television in their
own living rooms and discuss afterwards by  telephone with their
professors. The students included dislocated  workers aiming for a second
career, convinced the only way to  become immune from obsolescence was not
to aim for job security,  but to build employment security with a solid
educational base.  There were some traditional­age students, too, for
whom community  college had been the only feasible gateway to higher
education­and  who were now thinking about going on to four­year
schools and  bachelor's degrees. Some students were returning to school
having  already concluded a career. One retiree's entrepreneurial spirit
and  interest in education had led him to earn first a certificate and now
a  degree in travel and tourism­which he was parlaying into a
business  providing tours for older and disabled travellers.
</p><p>
What struck me most forcibly about these students was not just the  pride
they took in their colleges, but also their utter conviction that
education was their ticket up and out, the place where excuses  stopped
and opportunities began.
</p><p>
The data show that they are right. Research indicates that annual
earnings grow at least 5­10 percent for each additional year of
training or education a worker receives beyond high school.
Interestingly, the positive earnings effects of post­secondary
education do not appear to depend on whether or not the student  receives
a degree or on the type of education­e.g., vocational training,
community college, or four­year college.
</p><p>
The bottom line is that skills and education are critical to developing
new paths into the middle class­for experienced workers as well as
those just starting out.  Workers now have to be prepared to learn  new
skills throughout their careers, to be ready to apply them in  new ways
and in new settings. And this means that everyone who  has a stake in this
nation's future must help      create and sustain a  system of lifelong
learning that gives all Americans continuous  opportunities to learn.
</p><p>
The only way to establish common ground for all Americans is to  restore
paths to the middle class for those who have been left  behind. "Average"
Americans will feel­and be­secure only if the  education and
skills that the new jobs require come into their reach.  It has never been
more critical that we stake out and cultivate the  common ground between
school and college, education and work, the  college­bound and those
for whom "higher" education has up until  now loomed far out of reach.
