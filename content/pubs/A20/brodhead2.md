Multiculturalism</h2> <font size="+1">By Richard H. Brodhead</font>
</center><hr/> 
[Editor's Note: We excerpt here from "An Anatomy of
Multiculturalism," in the <i>Yale Alumni Magazine</i> (April 1994), a few
paragraphs in which Dean Brodhead offers some nuanced and reconciling
wisdom for the participants in the "culture wars."]<p> 
There was a time when literate culture­the things educated people
know and
believe other people should know­possessed certain well-marked
features.  The contents of literate culture were internally coherent; they
were widely agreed to; and above
all they were agreed to be universal in their interest or meaning....The
educational revolution for which multiculturalism is a shorthand name
embodies an unravelling of this older consensus.  Multiculturalism has
arisen through the spreading of the idea that the so-called universal was
in fact only partial:  one side of the story pretending to be the whole
story, the interests of some groups passing themselves off as the
interests of all.</p><p>
In recent years the growing suspicion of alleged universals has led to a
heightened sense that there are always many parties to every human
experience, and that their experiences of the same event are often
profoundly divergent.  In the wake of this realization, it has come to
seem that real education is to be found not in the move from the local to
the generalizedly "human," but in the effort to hear and attend to all the
different voices of human history­the voices of those who have
dominated the official stories, but also those silenced or minimized by
the official account.</p><p>
To its partisans, multicultural education is a matter of justice done at
last.  But there are many who are in sympathy with these social goals who
still regard their educational effects as pernicious.  One common cry is
that this movement's political ends
are leading it to abandon a long-cherished heritage education has passed
down from generation to generation.  But to this it can be replied that
the history of education is a history of change more than any of us like
to admit.  English wasn't thought a fit matter for university study before
the 19th century; it was a modern, vernacular literature, and education's
business was with the Classical.  My own field, American literature,
entered college curricula later still, not much earlier than 1940, having
been dismissed as a mere colonial appendage of English after English got
itself academically accepted.  Seen against such a background, it may be
possible to regard current curricular revolutions as the latest chapter of
a long story of change, not an unprecedented deviance saved for modern
times.</p><p>
But the central objection to multicultural reforms comes from the belief
that traditional literate culture is more meaningful than newly promoted
objects of study­that the lives and works of the hitherto ignored,
however much we may wish to feature them for sentimental or political
reasons, are less remarkable human achievements than the classics, and
their study therefore less rewarding.  When I came to the study of
American literature, for example, I often read that Hawthorne, Melville,
and the other geniuses of the American Renaissance wrote in opposition to
a popular sentimental literature of unimaginable banality, and­in a
beautiful convenience­my contemporaries and I understood that there
was no need to read this work in order to be confident of its perfect
worthlessness.  From a later vantage I can testify that when one takes the
trouble to look into them, ignored or downvalued traditions­even the
mid-19th century sentimental novel­can turn out to contain creations
of extraordinary power and interest.  (There would be no need to make this
point for our own time, when the achievements of women and minorities are
unmistakable; what contemporary literature course would leave out such
great American writers as the Asian-American Maxine Hong Kingston, or the
African-American Toni Morriso, or the Mexican-American Richard Rodriguez?) 
My own career in the last 15 years has led me to be increasingly engaged
with writers from outside the traditional canon.  In my courses I now
frequently teach authors from hitherto ignored traditions together with
their more famous contemporaries­Frederick Douglass and Fanny Fern
with Herman Melville, Louisa May Alcott and Charles W. Chesnutt with Mark
Twain.  And in my classes such writers do not just add new material, they
substantially change and enrich the terms on which every author is grasped
and understood.</p><p>
In my experience then, without causing any defection from the classic
authors I still love, teach, and value, the changes associated with
multiculturalism have brought a real renovation, a widening of the field
of knowledge and a deepened understanding of everything it contains.  Yet
without in any way retracting what I have said, it seems to me possible to
wonder whether current ways of conceptualizing and implementing
multicultural education are as problem-free as some proponents imply.</p><p>
To mention three problems very quickly:  Multiculturalism has promoted an
inclusionistic curriculum.  Its moral imperative not to discriminate
leads it to want to put everything in and leave nothing out.  But there is
an undeniable danger that the practice of universal curricular
representation can degenerate into high-minded tokenism.  Everyone has
seen the new-style anthologies and curricular units with snippet samplings
of all the nation's or world's peoples.  Like all official school
instruments, these show the strong sense of feeling answerable to a
vigilant cultural authority that watches their every move.  "Have we got
our Native American?  Our Asian-American?  Is our black a man?  If so,
have we also got a black woman?"</p><p>
I mean no denigration of these groups when I say that a curriculum
composed by checking off the proper inclusion of such groups often results
in tokenistic representation, and, worse, in what I'd call "Epcotization":
the reproduction of complicated cultural experiences into so many little
manageable units, pleasurably foreign yet quickly consumable, that we can
wheel in and out of at high velocity and leave with a complacent sense
that we have now appreciated that.  To my mind, it would not be a hater
but a lover of serious multiculturalism who would feel that much
contemporary multicultural education teaches naive, presumptuous attitudes
toward the cultures it intends to honor.  A week on Rudolfo Anaya's
<i>Bless Me, Ultima</i> or Chinua Achebe's <i>Things Fall Apart</i> in a
well-meaning modern classroom and the mysteries of Chicano or African life
seem to lie revealed!</p><p>
In addition to these potentials for naïveté, a second danger
of modern multiculturalism lies in the tendency to confer a dubious
absoluteness on group identities and group labels.  Some parts of American
society are experiencing a kind of romance of gender and ethnicity at
present, in which an alluring aura comes to surround an object to the
extent that it can be found to derive from a formerly marginalized group. 
Through this familiar logic, a book like Forrest Carter's <i>The Education
of Little Tree</i> won wide adoption as a high and junior high school text
in part because its author was understood to be an Indian (it has since
been learned that he was a white segregationist); and even so powerful a
book as Hurston's <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> has received a
curricular exposure out of all proportion to its interest because its
author fit the double categories of Woman and Black.  (For Hurston's
ironic reflections on such an abstraction or generalization of her
meaning, read her essay "How It Feels To Be Colored Me.")
</p><p>
To practice this kind of extrapolation from the person to the category
catches a valuable half-truth, namely that none of us is only individual,
and all of us have had our individual lives shaped by the social positions
we have lived in.  At the same time, a perpetual and unself-critical
practice of extrapolation from person to category negates the
countervailing truth­that no human group is homogeneous, and that no
personhas his or her identity set solely by the groups he or she belongs
to.  When we
teach the habit of thinking of people as Men and Women and Whites and
Blacks we run the risk of teaching­without meaning to­that
people can be adequtely identified by such generalizing labels.  But this
way danger lies, for what made the multicultural revolution necessary in
the first place was the existence of a world where qualified people could
be denied places in schools because they were blacks, or women, and so
on.</p><p>
Last, just to the extent that they value the enrichment it supplies,
proponents of multiculturalism will want to protect against another
lurking danger:  the presumption that its contributions have a monopoly on
everything important to know.  I confess that I have met products of
recent education who knew the new pan-ethnic literary canon to perfection
but who were ignorant of great traditional authors and content to be so; 
people who had subtle thoughts about (for instance) Nella Larsen's
recently rediscovered novel <i>Passing</i>, but who took no interest in
Faulkner's nearly contemporary novel of racial passing, <i>Light in
August</i>, since Faulkner was a famous misogynist.</p><p>
What is this attitude?  A new manifestation, surely, of the same
presumption I mocked in multiculturalism's more traditionalist foes, the
presumption that what I already know and like is worth knowing, and what I
don't is fit to ignore.  But no educational program can contain the whole
of wisdom.  Every educational model close-mindedly embraced can be made a
home for prejudice and limitation, the new as much as the old. 
Multiculturalism's great achievement was to teach us that traditional
literate culture did not include everything worth knowing, and that the
right corrective for its limits was to reach outside its boundaries and
learn to appreciate the different things encountered there.  But
multicultural education will do itself a favor if it remembers to apply
this same lesson to itself:  to be aware of the boundaries its own
enthusiasms establish, and to strive to feel the power of things outside
its ken­the works of traditional culture, and the numerous world
cultures that are not registered
with any detail or seriousness even in "reformed" American education.
