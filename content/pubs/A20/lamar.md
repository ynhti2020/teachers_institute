Encounter with a City</h2>By Howard R. Lamar
</center><hr/>
American education has somehow managed to fragment itself not only into
grammar, high school, college and university units, but between subject
matters and between content and method.  We have been in a confederation
period of education in the United States where educational states'
righters have prevailed over a sense of federal union.  It is that
problem, among others, that I think the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
was founded to overcome:  that is to establish, once and for all, the
commonality and relatedness of all problems concerning teaching and
educating no matter what subject and no matter at what level.  That in
turn touches a more fundamental problem in the United States:  a sense of
community.  Another purpose of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has
been to restore a sense of community to a city that once had one of the
most developed senses of civic pride one could find in America.<p>
For these reasons I agreed in 1979 to offer a seminar called "Remarkable
City:  New Haven in the Nineteenth Century."  But there were other
compelling reasons as well, chief among them being the fact that the State
of Connecticut required a course on state or local history to be taught in
the schools.  My hope was that we could use New Haven as a way to teach
urban history and further, to focus on the major local changes that had
occurred while we were in the process of becoming an industrial nation.  I
also wanted to focus on the resulting art and material culture that came
out of American industrialization.  Such an approach would also allow us
to focus on the history of labor as well as on the elite, and that, in
turn, inevitably meant studying immigrant and minority history.  While we
did not realize all of our plans in the seminar, a number of new courses
on local history did emerge, a great deal of fresh research was done, and
I, for one, made a series of discoveries about local and urban history in
the abstract and about Connecticut and New Haven in particular that
genuinely surprised us all.</p><p>
My first discovery was that one cannot live in New England without
acknowledging first the colonial period.  But what struck me most about
New Haven's founding was the nature of its settlers.  Economically they
were the very opposite of the Pilgrims at Plymouth.  The latter spent
years in poverty and in getting out of debt to their English sponsors.  In
stark contrast we have the statement in Reverend Benjamin Trumbull's 1818
edition of the <i>History of Connecticut</i> that "the New Haven
Adventurers were the most opulent company which came into New England, and
they designed a capital colony."  New Haven was not a rural frontier
settlement but a mercantile center and religious haven founded by urban
types.  Thus New Haven is one of the most persistent urban centers in
American history and deserves to be a major case study of urban life in
America over the three-and-a-half centuries of its existence.</p><p>
During our study of New Haven teachers used the students themselves to do
research, to compile family and neighborhood histories, to build a
nineteenth-century oyster boat, to study architecture and to interview
older New Haven citizens.  Benjamin A. Gorman fashioned an excellent
teaching unit entitled "Discover Eli Whitney" from the materials on the
inventor and his career, while Valerie Ann Polino found that she could
create a unit called "New Haven and the Nation, 1865-1900," in which the
relation of industrialization to labor, immigration and reform history was
traced.  She recorded the impact of ethnic labor on New Haven by following
the names of those arrested by the police department in the years
1865-1900.  At first Irishmen were arrested for many
violations, but when the city's police force slowly became Irish, those
arrested tended to have Italian names.  By 1900 28 percent of New Haven's
108,000 population was foreign-born.  That included 10,000 Irish, 6,000
Germans and Swedes, 5,000 Italians, 3,000 Russian Jews, and 2,000 English
and Scots.  Thus the local story of New Haven labor becomes a paradigm for
the immigration history of the United States in the years between 1865 and
1900.</p><p>
Let us go back for a moment to look at themes.  New Haven citizens created
or developed an extraordinary number of things that had shaped modern
life:  first, transportation systems, whether they were coastal and
Caribbean trade shipping, canals, toll roads, or railroads.  Then they
dealt with what you might call support services such as road surfaces,
oil, rubber, carriages, wagons, steam engines, the telegraph and the
telephone, and interchangeable parts.  It seems no mere accident that Eli
Whitney coming from such a crafts-man's paradise would invent and sell
gins to Southern planters who in turn used their profits to buy New Haven
carriages and clocks, or even that Southerners interested in such items
came to New Haven to buy them and then decided it was a great place to
vacation.  Nor should it seem accidental that New Haven's first black
population was West Indian足because of the shipping trade.</p><p>
By tracing the industries of New Haven we can trace its social and ethnic
history as well as the city's aesthetic history.  Indeed, we cannot
divorce art and material culture from the economy.  We cannot tell the
story of the entrepreneurs without telling
the story of the labor force.  Nor can we ignore an intriguing statistic
that 40 percent of the work force in the various New Haven factories in
the nineteenth century were women.  When one asks this question one is not
talking about the world of labor unions and strikes but the workers' world
and how it evolved from a religious small-town preindustrial economy to a
secular industrial one.  My plea is not that we substitute social problems
about the drinking parent or Vietnam for the impersonal story of national
political history.  It is that we go beyond both to try to relate the past
to the present in a personal, believable way.  And one way of doing that
is to study one's own past and relate it to the national scene.  </p><p>
But this cannot be done without also comprehending that urban history
means entrepreneurial history, labor history, social and cultural history,
and ethnic history.  It is this interdisciplinary approach that holds as
much promise for the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute as any other
teaching method or updating we have tried.  And in the process of learning
and talking we found that the problem of New Haven history like that of
American history was, in effect, a failure to apply Eli Whitney's concept
of interchangeable parts to its own past.  We discovered that we were all
a part of a whole and that by an intelligent study of the parts we would
better understand the whole.  Therein lies the purpose of a local effort
called the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and its significance as a
model for a national effort to relate town and gown, and the secondary
school to institutions of higher learning in a mutually advantageous
way.</p><p>
In 1991 I was again invited to teach a seminar for the Teachers Institute. 
This time I pursued the older theme足how is local history shaped by
larger social and political national events足from a very different
angle.  The seminar, "Studies in American Regions and Regionalism" focused
on the impact of the regional cultures and inhabitants of New England, the
South, and the West on New Haven.  Again the seminar proved to be a highly
rewarding and often surprising experience for all of us. </p><p>
Some of the most revealing seminar papers traced the coming of
African-Americans from the South to Harlem in New York and then to New
Haven.  At one level the accounts, often based on the experiences of the
parents of the seminar members, reflected familiar internal twentieth
century migration patterns, but at another, it proved to be a remarkable
saga of how the migrants managed to bring with them not only a rich
enduring religious and family heritage, but a quiet continuing pride in
their Southern origins.  There was and is a pride of place about their
former communities in North and South Carolina and Virginia.  In short,
much of New Haven's recent history could best be understood as an
encounter between urban New England and the rural South that was far more
complex and mutually rewarding than any of us in the seminar had expected. 
The members of the class also traced similar migrations from Mississippi
to Chicago and that of Black Americans migrating to California in this
century.</p><p>
Two years later, in 1993, Yale's and my own ongoing encounter with New
Haven was placed in perspective when the University conducted a survey of
all of its educational outreach programs in the city.  The survey found
that in addition to the activities of the Teachers Institute some
twenty-eight other programs existed ranging from museum and art gallery
programs for public school students to participation in part-time teaching
by Yale graduate, professional and undergraduate students.  These
activities have been seen by cities elsewhere in the nation as a possible
model for university-public school programs足a recognition of how much
"common ground" there is in these endeavors.</p><p>
As important as the New Haven story may be as a mustard seed leading to
the growth of other town-gown education programs, however, the most
fundamentally positive outcome of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
program is the coming together of teachers at all levels to design courses
in an atmosphere of mutual respect and the excitement of shared discovery
about more effective ways of teaching and learning.  One splendid result
has been that all involved have helped articulate what it means to be a
true  urban community.  <br/>
