Laguna Middle School (LMS), on the Laguna Pueblo Indian Reservation in New
Mexico, opened its doors in 1992 as the first tribally designed, built,
and operated school in the state.  Our vision and philosophy are based on
the belief that the Laguna community is not only capable of running its
own school, but is uniquely qualified to determine its own educational
future.  The tribe's dream of controlling their educational destiny has
been furthered by two Lagunas in particular:  Gil Sanchez, Laguna Departme
nt of Education Superintendent, and Nick Cheromiah, LMS Principal, who
have provided the expertise and leadership necessary to make this vision a
reality.  As a relatively new teacher (I began my teaching career when the
school began), I've had the exciting opportunity to learn from these
educators and this community, and to participate in their historic
undertaking.<p>
Much of LMS's success stems from our commitment to making it a real
community-based school.  For example, when we determined how we would
organize the delivery of curriculum at different grade levels, we invited
the entire community to help us decide.  We
took the time to educate all those concerned about the pros and cons
associated with different methods.  We held several informative meetings
about the various approaches to middle level education, during the day and
in the evening, and invited parents and all interested community members
to attend.  Staff, too, were provided with current research on the various
options so they could make an informed decision.  We also taught our
students about the alternatives in class, so they could participate as
well.</p><p>
We sought an organizational structure that would best reflect the
community's needs and desires.  Collaboratively, we decided on what we
call a "transitional model," in which each grade would be organized
differently.  Sixth grade would operate much like elementary, with core
academics taught in self-contained classes, but with movement to elective
courses to introduce them to the choices available at higher levels.  In
the seventh grade, students would experience the interdisciplinary,
"middle school" model.  And finally, in the eighth grade, students would
have a departmentalized program that would more likely prepare them for
high school.  This process illustrates our commitment to careful
deliberation, and decision-making that includes the entire community.  In
making LMS a true community-based school, we try to give every stakeholder
some ownership and a voice in determining how we operate.</p><p>
Our mission mandates preparing our students to participate in many world
societies, including the global technological society.  Realizing the
educational opportunities offered by telecommunications and the Internet,
we have made a major investment to become a stop on the Information
SuperhighwayÂ­an actual In-ternet node, something that few K-12
schools have tried.  This decision was influenced by the successful
telecommunications work already underway in my classes on BreadNet, and by
the assistance
and training Bread Loaf has been providing to our staff.  Using BreadNet,
my students have participated in numerous on-line discussions with
students in many states.  BreadNet has proven to be a powerful tool for
them to use in reaching out to other worlds, simultaneously expanding
their social horizons and their communication skills.</p><p>
Laguna recently received a major U. S. Department of Education grant to
help implement technology into Native American schools nationwide.  We
hope to develop a telecommunications network that resembles BreadNet,
which will allow studentsand teachers in participating schools to
collaborate electronically.  Bread Loaf significantly informs our efforts
to provide our students with high quality education and access to other
world societies.  Laguna Middle School and Bread Loaf have entered into an
unusual partnership:  a middle school and a graduate school working
together to strengthen and improve learning and teaching in schools and
communities.
