<center><h2>Speaking Out on Diversity</h2>
<font size="+1">By Rev. Frederick J. Streets</font>
</center><hr/>
The New Haven, Connecticut Board of Education established this past year a
Committee on Inter-group Relations consisting of students, teachers,
school administrators, and Yale University faculty members. Sub-committees
were formed to explore the issue from various perspectives.  A
sub-committee on Community Building held focus-group discussions with high
and middle school students, who were encouraged to share their
perspectives on the relationship among diverse ethnic and racial groups in
their schools. 
<p> African-American students from a predominantly Black high school
student body shared with me, as their group facilitator, their views about
student diversity and community.</p><p>
Diversity meant more to these young people than being part of a student
body composed of students from a variety of ethnic or racial backgrounds. 
They made it clear that although their school was majority
African-American, there was a great deal of difference among them.  These
distinctions included the students' class year, the neighborhood and
middle school from which they came to high school, the level of student
maturity (as defined by the students), personality, interests, goals, and
ambitions.  These characteristics were important to them as they made
decisions about with whom to associate and whom to accept into their
group.</p><p>
They emphasized the importance of being seen by others as they saw
themselves, rather than as exclusively a member of a homogeneous group.
This was a preference of students who had come to the high school from an
all-Black as well as a racially and ethnically diverse middle school. 
This preference underscores Gómez's point, in "A Leap of Faith,"
that diversity is an "internal phenomenon" as well as an external one.</p><p>
Identities are not fully formed by the time the students enter high
school.  No matter how many characteristics they may in fact share as
members of a group (e.g., racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, class, gender,
religious, etc.), they wish to be respected as persons and regarded as
individuals by their teachers and peers.  High school also represents to
them a time when they value being a member of a variety of groups.  As
Gómez says: "...we often forget that building community requires
the recognition that boundaries are arbitrary and fluid.  Diversity...is
about recognizing within ourselves that our identities are not fixed in a
binary opposition....We exist within a complex matrix of shifting
identities, both within and between ourselves."</p><p>
We know as educators that the development of a student's sense of self and
well-being is influenced by how well educators use their understanding of
students as individuals.  The social factors of the high school
environment have an impact upon students' self-esteem and sense of
belonging.  They may either join with or reject their fellow students
based on their evaluation of the differences among them.</p><p>
Sometimes this rejection takes on a very antagonistic, hostile, and even
violent form of expression.  The chances of this occurring are minimized
when students have opportunities to interact with one another through
constructive extracurricular activities and service projects.  Even then a
fundamental need that must be addressed if students are to appreciate
diversity and build a sense of community is the enhancement of their
self-esteem.</p><p>
A student in my discussion group suggested that there be classes on how to
build self-esteem and how to understand and handle feelings.  Many
students experience daily assaults upon their sense of well-being in their
interactions with a variety of other people.  Exploring with them what
they find offensive in their relationship will help us to understand what
is helping to shape their identities and world views.  No doubt students
need the existence of adults to help them understand and respond to their
experiences.  But they also need to be encouraged not to see the
differences between themselves and others as reasons to be defensive about
who they are or to be antagonistic towards others.  The relationship
between students and their teachers helps to set the stage and establish
the tone for how students relate to one another.</p><p>
The lack or abundance of racial, ethnic, or cultural sameness or diversity
alone does not develop a student's sense of community.  Nor does it
increase the student's appreciation of self and others.  Increased
self-esteem, more opportunities for interaction, and positive relationship
experiences with their peers, their teachers, and other school staff
enhance the students' sense of belonging.  Confidence in their ability to
negotiate relationships with others in a positive, healthy, non-violent
manner is increased.  Such confidence enables them to build community
among themselves and improve their chances to learn about themselves and
others.</p><p>
Our ability to capture the imagination of students and to stimulate in
them a hopeful vision of the future begins with our taking them and their
need for affirmation seriously.</p><p> 
Helping them to learn the meaning of values, how we form them and behave
accordingly are central tasks in helping them to celebrate diversity and
create a sense of community among themselves.  Included in this purpose of
education are those goals of promoting student autonomy and group
identity.  These are essential to cultivate in students if their
educational experience is to translate into one that helps them to become
good citizens.  Individuality and group membership are not mutually
exclusive.  Nor are they antithetical to the aims and meaning of a
democratic society.  Their relationship is a necessary dynamic in the
experience of democracy and that experience is democracy's best teacher.
