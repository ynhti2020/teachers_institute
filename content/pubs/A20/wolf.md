<center><h2>Entering Multiculturalism</h2> 
<font size="+1">By Bryan J.
Wolf</font> </center><hr/> 
Over the past decade, I have led a variety of seminars for the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute that have focused on issues of race and
ethnicity.  I did so in part because the New Haven school system, like its
counterparts across the nation, has been reluctant to develop a curriculum
that reflects the needs and histories of the urban populations it serves. 
And I did so for the most selfish of reasons, for my own sake, so that I
could have a truer, wider vision of my world.<p>
It was not always so.  The first seminar I taught for the Teachers
Institute in 1989 mirrored the teaching I had been doing at the time with
my English and American Studies students at Yale.  We examined painters
and writers from colonial times through the twentieth century.  The
curriculum units produced by the seminar participants reflected the
materials of the class: everyday life in revolutionary era America, the
art of the Hudson River School, modernist architecture.</p><p>
Something was missing.  That first seminar addressed an array of
"canonical" writers and artists without also addressing the nitty-gritty
teaching needs of New Haven public school teachers.  Their working (and
often non-working) hours were filled with questions for which Ralph Waldo
Emerson and Jackson Pollock were not the answers.</p><p>
In retrospect, I suspect the seminar lacked what you might call "soul." 
It had spirit and energy in abundance.  But that is not the same as
"soul," a term that I use here to suggest the richness of racial and
ethnic cultural traditions in the United States.  To teach a class with
soul is to tap into the diversity of everyday American expressive life,
catching that life as it is transformed into art.</p><p>
In succeeding years, I began moving away from canonical texts and images
into what were, for me, relatively unexplored terrains.  And my vehicle
for this voyage into the unknown was the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute.  I found that each successive seminar that I led for the
Institute carried me that much further into what we might term
"alternative cultural geographies."  By this I mean new realms of
learning, non-traditional canons, that had been labeled "terra incognita"
by those who once mapped thecontours of American literature.</p><p>
I wanted a new map.  The old maps, the ones I had been using, resembled
those centuries-old vellum artifacts that show the known world, the "New
World," as the Atlantic seaboard, while filling the interior with wild
beasts and imagined lands.  I needed something a little more
up-to-date.</p><p>
As all teachers know, one learns by teaching.  To be successful in the
classroom, you must receive as much from your students as you give.  The
Teachers Institute became for me the place<i> par excellence</i> where
such exchange occurred.  I found a freedom there to rethink not only
<i>what</i> I had been teaching, but <i>why</i> I had been teaching
it.</p><p>
The seminar participants, in turn, were hungry for new materials.  They
were happy to explore mainstream, "canonical" texts, but their hunger
turned into more than hunger­it became a passion, a Rabelaisian
appetite­when we started reading novels
by "ethnic" writers and viewing art devoted to issues of racial identity.
</p><p>
What happened, in effect, is that the New Haven Teachers Institute
provided me with a space, a forum, for my own version of an experimental
classroom.  The seminar participants and I converted our weekly meetings
into occasions for unlocking closed doors.
We opened up new texts, raised the windows onto previously uninvestigated
vistas, and generally converted the classroom from a repository of
received traditions, a museum with blackboards, to a way-station en route
to new cultural experiences.</p><p>
This means that we ate mangoes in class (part of a curriculum unit on
culture and food) and then read <i>When I Was Puerto Rican</i>, a lush
account of Esmeralda Santiago's experiences growing up in the Caribbean,
where mangoes are as abundant as sunny days.  We viewed one participant_s
private collection of African textiles (from her Peace Corps days) and
then studied African influences on Caribbean and North American crafts
traditions.  We followed Jacob Lawrence's epic <i>Migration Series</i>,
sixty painted panels that narrate the movement of southern Blacks to
northern cities in the years following World War I, and then read Toni
Morrison's <i>Beloved</i>, a gothic account of the risks that attend all
efforts at cultural recovery.</p><p>
Eventually this new knowledge made its way into my Yale teaching.  I
created an undergraduate seminar on the topic of "Ethnicity and Dissent"
in American art and literature, and then converted the seminar into a
lecture course that I will teach for the first time in the spring of 1997. 
My research interests similarly shifted, and I now devote increasing
amounts of my time to writing about multiculturalism in contemporary
literature and art.<br/>
Why did this exploratory teaching and learning occur in the Teachers
Institute before it happened in my regular instruction with Yale
undergraduate and graduate students?  I have been pondering this question
for a while now, and I think I know the answer. 
But to understand that answer, we need to detour for a moment to an
arresting sculpture by Martin Puryear, an African-American artist who
works with marvelously crafted, often bio-morphic forms, constructed in
wood and metal.  To understand the relation
of the Teachers Institute to the year-round curriculum at Yale, we need
to consider first Puryear's <i>To Transcend</i>.</p><p> 
Puryear's sculpture looks a bit like an ungainly elephant's trunk reaching
up the wall.  It consists of two blocks of wood united by a lean wooden
tether.  The tether emerges from a kidney-shaped block evocative of the
body and the organic world.  It (the tether) arcs gently upward before
arriving at a disk that both mirrors the wooden base and converts it into
an abstracted and precise geometric object.</p><p>
<i>To Transcend</i> is defined by the contrast between the disk at the top
and the base at the bottom.  The disk is more delicate, more refined, more
cerebral, than the kidney form that launches it.  It functions both as a
pointer to realms beyond its grasp­an image of transcendence­and
as a cap, an acknowledgment of the limits that attend all terrestrial
questing.</p><p>
<i>To Transcend</i> reminds us that true transcendence never fully leaves
the ground.  What we see when we look up is not air and light, but a round
wooden disk, an idealized version, a utopian reworking, of our own squat
and kidney-shaped lives.  Those lives are lived, like that earth-hugging
block of wood, at ground level.  They remain incomplete until we learn to
cast a glance upwards, beyond ourselves.  For then and only then do we
learn to measure who we are by what we might become.</p><p>
The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is one place for measuring what we
might become.  It resembles that disk crowning Puryear_s lean arc of wood. 
It echoes the world around it at the same time as it attempts to alter,
rethink, that world.  Like Puryear's rounded disk, the Teachers Institute
provides a space where everyday life may be reimagined, where the
curriculum may be rethought and reformed.  It is a place at once tethered
to the realities of urban America and yet capable of rising above
them.</p><p>
And that, I believe, is why I entered multiculturalism through the doors
of the Teachers Institute.  The world of urban America issues into the
classroom at the Teachers Insitute with an insistence, an unrelenting
pressure, that otherwise tends to be muted at a privileged institution
like Yale.  Once in the door, those pressures change not only what we
teach but how we think about teaching itself.</p><p>
What I discovered through my seminars with the Teachers Institute is that
multicultural teaching begins with one premise:  that no single group on
any side of the color line can tell its story without reference to the
peoples and traditions on the other side.  <i>My</i> story is not complete
without <i>yours</i>.  That is the great and dirty secret of American
history.  It is also our saving truth.  W.E.B. Dubois was right: race is
the central issue of the twentieth century.  And all of us are part of
that saga.</p><p>
To say this is to stop defending the arts as repositories of universal
truth.  That leaves them like Dickens' Marley: dead as a doornail. 
Instead we need to see the arts as actors, fighters, in a contest over
cultural values, a struggle to legitimate particular social visions.  I no
longer measure a work of art by its "beauty."  That term‹and the
values that go with it­tends to set art apart from the world, to
enshrine it, "museum-ify" it, rather than return it to its historical
roots so that it might continue to live and breathe.</p><p>
I feel more comfortable with a less "aesthetic" vocabulary.  That art is
best which most powerfully addresses its own social, cultural or
historical situation.  I believe that art is not about culture but the
<i>politics</i> of culture.  It is a form of power: not the power of guns
or dollars, but the ability to think critically.  Art provides us with one
of the few spaces we have in our society for self reflection: critical
examination of one's life, one's community, one's identity.  The
classroom, potentially, is another such space.  Good teaching, in this
way, resembles strong art.  Such art shows us how we are enmeshed in
history and how to think critically about that history.  It opens our
eyes.</p><p>
The Teachers Institute has been for me an eye-opening place.  It allows
its participants to relax just enough from their daily chores to catch a
glimpse, however fleeting, of the larger picture.  Or­to mix
metaphors in mid-stream­we might say that the Teachers Institute
provides its participants, both Yale professors and New Haven public
school teachers, with a small taste of utopia, where knowledge, like
mangoes, ripens in the heat of a new day.
