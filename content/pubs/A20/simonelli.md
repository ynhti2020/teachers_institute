<center><h2>Partnering with Indigenous Education</h2>
<font size="+1">By Richard Simonelli</font>
</center><hr/>
Indian education in North America is experiencing the most profound and
exciting change it has ever known. Native people are entering mainstream
post-secondary institutions of higher learning more than ever before, but
they're making this transition in a way they hope will keep their cultural
identities intact. At the same time that some native people find
themselves moving into the wider educational community, others are
rediscovering and beginning to teach the ageold principles and practices
of indigenous education, which have nurtured indigenous cultures worldwide
for thousands of years. <p>
Embracing both mainstream Western education and traditional indigenous
knowledge offers urban and reservation communities the best chance for
both physical and cultural survival in the 21st century. This twofold
educational movement among Indian people足pursuing a college education
while at the same time relearning viable principles behind the Old
Ways足promises mainstream educational reform a potential new ally. 
But where must it look for this collaboration and what questions
should be asked?  And what has happened in Indian communities allowing
traditional wisdom to be heard once again?</p><p>
According to Dr. Gregory Cajete足a Tewa from Santa Clara Pueblo,
educator and author of <i>Look to the Mountain: An Ecology of Indigenous
Education足</i>the principles of tribal education arise directly from
connection to place. He says, "The very word 'indigenous' is derived from
the Latin roots <i>indu</i> or<i> endo</i>, which are related to the Greek
root <i>endina</i>, which means entrails.  Indigenous means being so
completely identified with a place that you reflect its very entrails, its
insides, its soul."  Cajete's book is a scholarly work describing the
principles by which tribal people were taught. It stands one step before
actual curriculum design and development. But like indigenous education
itself, the book contains stories, myths, drawings and commentary which
attest to the intrinsically holistic nature of indigenous education.</p><p>
Tribal peoples worldwide often use circular symbols to describe the
inherent connectedness or holism of all phenomena. One expression of this
is called the Medicine Wheel. The Medicine Wheel originates with Plains
Indian cultures and its teachings are like a compass that can help
individuals, communities or nations understand the whole-system
implications of their activities. The Medicine Wheel teaches that all
individuals are comprised of spiritual, emotional, mental and physical
qualities. In one rendering of the Medicine Wheel, the human spirit is
connected with north, emotions with the east, mental qualities are located
in the south, and the physical aspect is identified with the west. The
Medicine Wheel teaches that there are also societal and communal qualities
carried by each of us. These are placed in the center of the Wheel to show
that healthy community is the result of whole persons. The key idea in
Indian education is that in order for harmonious, productive community
activities to occur, all principles of the Medicine Wheel must find
expression in education. </p><p>
The qualities of indigenous education are a direct outcome of being deeply
committed to place. When people feel affection for where they live, a
sense of the whole develops and the intuitive faculty of compassionate
vision comes into existence. Vision or
far-seeing allows individuals and communities to articulate healthgiving
plans and goals which, as the Iroquois people say, must look seven
generatins into the future for the good of society. What are some of the
principles of indigenous education? <i>Look to the Mountain</i> touches on
these, and many more:</p><p>
1.
Comprehensive thinking and awareness of diverse areas of knowledge
must be active in all aspects of education. Indigenous education is
interdisciplinary education.</p><p> 
2.
Nature is the first teacher and model of process. Connection to
nature is not romantic or sentimental, but essential for survival. Whether
in kindergarten or studying calculus, indigenous education is
environmental education.</p><p>
3.
Indigenous teaching focuses as much on learning with the heart as on
learning with the mind. Indigenous education always includes the affective
or feeling side of life.</p><p>
4.
Overt intellectualization is kept to a minimum. Teaching through a
real situation expands the realm of learning beyond speculation.
Indigenous education favors direct experience and learning by doing.</p><p>
5.
Readiness to learn is a basic determinant of learning. Indigenous
education seizes moments of teachability as the best teachers.</p><p>
6.
At all levels, whether in preschool or in a university engineering
program, the relationship of student and teacher is key. Indigenous
education is always a person toperson process.</p><p>
7.
Teaching and learning is a matter of serving and being served.
Indigenous education is servicebased education.</p><p>
8.
Creative dreaming, art, ritual and ceremony help the student
externalize inner thoughts and qualities for examination. Indigenous
education includes the inner world. </p><p>
9. Learning is a socially and community based experience. The student
moves freely between private study and group experience. Effective
indigenous education is that which takes place between learners and their
community. </p><p>
10. From middle school to graduate school, learning is connected to each
individual's life process. Education is a relationship between one_s inner
self, family, community and the natural environment, as well as
involvement with the information content of
the subject.  Indigenous education is first and foremost a sacred life
journey.  </p><p>
Spirituality and the sacred are important values in traditional indigenous
cultures. What these words signify to any individual may be a very
personal matter. But in order to discuss indigenous education, the central
role of these must be kept in mind.</p><p>
Although the concepts contained in <i>Look to the Mountain</i> are
ancient, they are also new to many Indian people due to the destructive,
and highly effective, assimilation policies of the federal government. As
Indians move into higher education, sometimes they seem to be caught in
noone's land. Cajete says, "Indian people continue to struggle with modern
educational structures that are not of their own making, but are separated
from, and compete with, their traditional forms of education. There
continues to be an educational schizophrenia in Indian education as it
exists today. Indian people continue to be one of the most educationally
disadvantaged and atrisk groups in America."</p><p>
For Indians to succeed in college and also retain their varied traditions,
it is becoming increasingly clear that the strength and support of the
Indian community at school is a makeorbreak factor. Schools with high
Indian retention and graduation rates are those with good Indian programs.
Indian programs form the nucleus for panIndian communities often far from
a student's home country. Effective Indian support programs are those
which have a solid funding commitment from the administration, a native
director advocate who has also been down the educational road and students
with a keen desire to give back to their people. If these exist, then
Indian student organizations, tutoring and mentoring relationships,
ceremonies, celebrations and the caring and sharing which are part of
Indian culture support students in an educational system with values very
different from their own.</p><p>
Cornell University has an Indian student population of approximately 70
graduate and undergraduate students plus an excellent Indian support
program. Cornell also offers a modest academic Indian studies curriculum. 
At Cornell, Indian Studies is a course concentration that benefits both
Indian and nonIndian students. Colleges nationwide usually administer
Indian support programs and Indian studies programs as two distinct
entities.</p><p>
The Akwe:kon (pronounced aGWAYgohn) residence at Cornell University is a
new Indian program house in which people of all ethnicities are encouraged
to live together. Akwe:kon is a Mohawk word meaning "all of us." Akwe:kon,
in fact, pioneers a handson approach to teaching about cultural diversity
because people share housing and get to know each other first hand. It is
just one example of the principle that, indigenous education favors direct
experience and learning by doing. The Cornell Indian program is also
developing partnerships with Indian communities and school districts among
the Indian populations in upstate New York. A conference on economic and
educational matters was held at Cornell in early June so that grassroots
Indian community members and K12 Indian educators from around the state
could talk about their needs.</p><p>
The "Science Clan" at Northeastern State University (NSU) in Tahlequah,
Oklahoma is yet another example of grade school-university partnerships
taking place in Indian education.</p><p>
Native American science students from the AISES (American Indian Science
and Engineering Society) chapter at NSU have begun to take a "Mister
Wizard"  science show on the road, serving many rural schools with Indian
enrollments.  The volunteer effort of the Science Clan offers many
youngsters the first glimpse of handson science that they have ever
sen.</p><p>
What is the possible common ground between Indian education and mainstream
education?  In particular, what can the educational reform movement learn
from native people striving to meet their own educational challenges? The
education of whole persons, by re-emphasizing the ethical, affective and
humanistic foundations of education, is certainly suggested by studying
the ten aspects of indigenous education excerpted from <i>Look to the
Mountain</i>.  And a fresh look at what is meant by "sacred" in
contemporary culture might come as a boon from such a collaboration.</p><p>
The new field of traditional or indigenous knowledge is another possible
area of crossfertilization. Native peoples have always had their own
understanding of plants, animals, stars, the environment, prehistoric
migrations, and knowledge resulting in harmonious community, to name but a
few categories. AISES, in partnership with noted author Vine Deloria, Jr.,
has hosted four traditional knowledge conferences since 1992, and more are
planned to further explore this field. There are also innovative
traditional knowledge programs currently underway at the California
Institute for Integral Studies, Sinte Gleska University (Mission, South
Dakota), Northern Arizona University and Evergreen State College (Olympia,
Washington.)</p><p>
At its root, indigenous education is about human virtue, respect,
sharing, caring, helping and humane and ethical relationships. When these
exist then technical knowledge has a better chance to become a community
builder rather than a community destroyer. As Indian students increasingly
learn the skills and technologies which have become synonymous with
Western, American education, mainstream public education has an
opportunity to reexperience in partnership with native people a face that
it once knew. Partnering in this way we can_t fail to realize that we are
all indigenous to the earth.
