The Puente Project</h2>
<font size="+1">By Patricia McGrath and Felix Galaviz</font>

One of the challenges facing public schools and colleges is the lack of a
stable, permanent latticework of relationships on which to grow.  Teachers
and principals come and go; corporate partnerships are formed and later
dissolved; political agendas will shift every few years, creating new
priorities, restrictions and demands.  What, then, remains?  In the Puente
Project the answer is clear and resonant:  the community.  It is the
community that ultimately has the greatest stake in the success or failure
of educational programs for its children; thus greater community
involvement leads to greater school accountability and responsiveness, and
ultimately to a more effective educational environment.<p>
We began the Puente Project in 1981 at Chabot Community College in
Hayward, California, where we met as colleagues­McGrath an English
teacher and Galaviz a counselor and Assistant Dean.  Concerned about the
high dropout rate of Mexican-American/Latino students, we collaborated to
design a program that employs three major components, each of which
includes a community focus:  matching students with mentors from the
Mexican-American/Latino professional and academic community; providing
intensive English instruction that focuses on writing and reading about
students' cultural experiences and identity; and providing students with
counselors from the Latino community who have first-hand knowledge of the
challenges they face.  The program mission is to help students stay in
school, enroll in college, earn bachelors' and advanced degrees, and
return to their communities as leaders and mentors.</p><p>
The educational landscape from which Puente emerged was extremely bleak. 
Mexican-American and Latino students are the most educationally
underserved ethnic group in America.  Just over half of all Latino
students graduate from high school, as compared with 77 percent of
African-American students, and 82 percent of European American students.
Of those who do graduate from high school, only 29 percent continue their
education at the college level, and only 3.9 percent are eligible for the
University of California.  Among those students who do pursue
post-secondary education, 80-85 percent enroll in community colleges.  Of
these, most drop out prior to completion of the program; only 8.4 percent
go on to receive bachelors' degrees.  Given these statistics,
we recognized at the onset of the project the importance of integrating
the Mexican-American/Latino community in a meaningful and participatory
way.</p><p>
The Puente program is implemented and conducted on campuses by a
teacher/counselor team, full time employees of the college who are trained
in an initial residential Puente Training Institute held at the University
of California, Berkeley.  Here teams are
introduced to a) specific teaching and counseling methodologies; b) 
strategies for working successfully in the community; and c) collaborative
ways of working as effective teams in order to integrate the program
components.  The training is on-going and extensive.  Throughout the
academic year teams participate in workshops to share successful
practices, to learn how to train mentors, and to help each other solve
problems.  An organizational structure which includes liaisons in the
field pushes the power
down to a local and regional level with Puente liaisons helping local
teams meet their needs as issues emerge.  Essentially, the structure makes
it possible to maintain program quality while training additional Puente
counselors and teachers to help in the expansion of the program.</p><p>
The success of Puente, and the degree towhich the Mexican-American/Latino
community took ownership of it, surpassed our greatest expectations.
Fifteen years later, Puente is operating in 39 community colleges
throughout California and recently implemented a secondary school version
of its program in 18 high schools across the state, with 4,000 new and
continuing students in the Community College program and 1,700 in the High
School program.  A recent study commissioned by the University of
California Task Force on Latino Eligibility found that the transfer rate
of Latino students to four-year institutions is 44 percent greater in
community colleges which have a Puente program than in community colleges
without the program.  The task force went on to recommend that the
University "expand strategically targeted outreach services in the
community colleges, modeled after the Puente Project, even at the cost of
limiting other, less effective K-12 outreach activities."</p><p>
Community input has been woven into the Puente Project at several levels. 
First, mentors are recruited from the Mexican-American/Latino community by
other members of the community, as well as by Puente staff.  Matching
students with professionals in the community serves many purposes:  it
provides the students, many of whom are the first in their family to
pursue post-secondary education, with successful academic and career role
models; it offers the students first-hand exposure to various professional
settings and responsibilities, thus helping them to make informed career
decisions (well beyond what a college career counselor is able to provide) 
and to draw inspiration from seeing their mentors at work in a "real-life" 
professional context.  Also, community-based writing and research
assignments have proven to be a very popular and engaging writing
assignment for the Puente students, many of whom come to the project with
a firm belief they "can't write."</p><p>
Another mechanism for fostering community support has been the inclusion
of counselors who have personal experience with the Latino culture and
community in the program.  Initially, the counselors were introduced to
provide students with academic and personal guidance that is grounded in
their cultural context, and to recruit and match appropriate mentors for
the students.  It gradually became apparent, however, that the counselors
were also functioning as a nexus for a community eager to provide support
for Puente.  Latino community organizations offered scholarships; Latino
corporate groups invited students to professional conferences; local
corporations adopted Puente classes.  Far more people in the community
were concerned and willing to contribute than we had anticipated.</p><p>
Several prominent Latino writers have taken an interest in and contributed
to Puente, including Jimmy Santiago Baca and Helena Viramontes.  This
reinforces the sense of community that the Puente students share and
encourages them to grow as writers and community members.  Puente's
approach to the teaching of reading and writing was developed on the
premise that if students are interested in the content of their writing
and reading, and care about what they have to say, then the study of the
formal aspects of language will follow.  Therefore, cultural identity and
experience are the focus of many Puente reading and writing assignments.
Again, student response has been outstanding; many students who could not
fill a page at the beginning of the Puente English course are found
writing poetry and rigorous academic essays by the course's end.  In 1994
Puente students in one community college initiated the idea for an all day
writers and artists forum called "Día de la Cultura."  The event
was attended
by 350 people, including eight nationally known Chicano artists.  So
successful was this forum that it has become an annual event.</p><p>
For years the community has requested that Puente move into high schools. 
In 1993 we began a four-year replication project using resources already
developed in local communities.  In recognition of the fact that secondary
schools generally have even fewer resources for funneling community
support than do communit colleges, we created a new position for the high
school program:  the Community Mentor Liaison.  The "CML's" actively
develop partnerships with local community business people, civic leaders,
and professionals; recruit and train mentors for the students; and help
foster community awareness about and ownership of the project.  (As a
recent example, a Community Mentor Liaison in Southern California brought
in 53 summer jobs for Puente students through one mentor.)  Parent
attendance at school meetings has reached 100 percent in some Puente
schools; all the parents have met their children_s mentors.  Organizations
have donated books, tickets for events, transportation for field trips.
The number of community members who wish to be mentors exceeds the number
of available students. </p><p>
Given the enormous challenges facing public schools and colleges in our
contemporary society­financial, structural, and political‹it has
become necessary to look to resources beyond those traditionally afforded
the public schools.  Add to that the almost overwhelming challenges faced
by Mexican-American/Latino students in California, and it becomes
necessary to fully integrate a greater societal force, a powerful and
lasting source of on-going structural support.  That force has been the
Mexican-American/Latino community.
