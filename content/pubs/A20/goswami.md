<center><h2>Bread Loaf and Rural Communities</h2>

Some 400 men and women each summer‹most of them middle and high
school teachers‹choose to spend their summers to pursue further
studies at one of Bread Loaf's three campuses: at the Bread Loaf site
outside Middlebury, Vermont, at Lincoln College, Oxford, and (as of June
1996) at the Native American Preparatory School, Rowe, New Mexico. More
than forty Bread Loaf faculty members, drawn from colleges and
universities across America and from the United Kingdom, teach at the
three Bread Loaf sites. The result is a community of great intellectual
excitement and commitment to teaching.  <p>
In 1993, the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund began its support of the
Rural Teacher Network (BLRTN), a program of the Bread Loaf School of
English now far along in its third year.  The Network recruits rural
teachers (mainly middle-school and high-school teachers) from six
states­Alaska, Arizona, Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, and
Vermont­to come to the Bread Loaf School for up to three summers of
study in writing, the teaching of writing, literature, and theater arts.
The 30 or more teachers accepted each year as DeWitt Wallace-Reader's
Digest Fellows receive generous awards, including tuition, room, board,
round-trip travel, a book allowance, and a $1,000 stipend for professional
expenses in the subsequent academic year. The Fellows take two courses at
Bread Loaf and, in addition, receive training on Bread Loaf's electronic
network, BreadNet. In 1995, the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund helped
fund two Bread Loaf summer institutes: the third annual Piney Woods Bread
Loaf Summer Institute held at the Piney Woods Country Life School in
Mississippi and the Bread Loaf Institute for Northern New Mexico Teachers
of English at the Edward Ortiz School in Santa Fe.  Summer institutes were
planned for 1996 in Ganado, Arizona, and Gallup, New Mexico.</p><p>
BreadNet, a central feature of the Rural Teacher Network, may be accessed
by almost any type of computer, either over the Internet or via a modem.
It is user-friendly, and even the most stubborn technophobe can learn to
join with a minimum of time, trouble and anxiety.  Accounts are given out,
free of charge, to any Bread Loaf student, graduate, or faculty member who
makes the request.  Teachers use BreadNet to conduct a broad range of
activities, from reading groups to professional support to curriculum
design and intense discussion about educational issues.  BreadNet is a
means for all members of the Bread Loaf community to stay in contact with
each other during the academic year between Bread Loaf summers. </p><p>
Since 1993, BLRTN teachers and students in Vermont have conducted
inquiries about school restructuring and reform; more than a dozen active
BreadNet conferences are the result of teachers and students collaborating
on literature, writing, and publishing projects.  Several members of the
Rural Network teach BreadNet courses for which students receive full
credit:  for example, Mary Ginny DuBose at Waccamaw High School, Pawleys
Island, South Carolina, teaches "Writing with Telecommunications," for
which students design and manage a number of online conferences.  Susan
Miera, at Pojoaque High School (a rural school near Santa Fe), teaches
"Writing for the Community," a course that combines action research with
public service, writing, and publishing (online
and in print).  At some point, all teachers iclude students in networked
activities, reflecting the belief that benefits to students are the
Network_s primary goal.</p><p>
Aside from BreadNet, there is hardly a means of communication that the
rural teachers have not used to stay in touch. In Alaska, for example,
living at great distances from each other, teachers have used
audio-conference phone calls to plan statewide projects. But even
telecommunications, conference calls, and faxes can_t replace face-to-face
meetings, and there are many such BLRTN meetings each year‹in Juneau,
in Phoenix, in Albuquerque, in Jackson, Mississippi, at the Penn Center at
St. Helena, South Carolina, and at the Bread Loaf-Vermont campus itself.
Several members of the Bread Loaf faculty and BLRTN staff (James Maddox,
Director of the Bread Loaf School of English, and Rocky Gooch, Director of
BLRTN telecommunications) are lucky enough to take part in these
face-to-face meetings.  We probably learn more about Fellows­and
about rural education‹from visits that take us into schools and
classrooms than we do in any of our other activities.  A great challenge
is to demonstrate locally and nationally the excellence that exists in
many, many rural classrooms.  Courageous and innovative rural teachers
should be recognized and highly visible, so that their work may inform the
discourse and actions of policy-makers and educators.</p><p>
Partnerships with individual teachers and with schools connect Bread Loaf
with the broader community, requiring us to rethink notions of change, of
practice, of friendship and shared leadership and to figure out what it
means to act on the assumption that
teachers and students are essential sources of information about schools
and classrooms, that teachers_ reflective narratives are essential agents
and advocates of school change.  The changes that result from Bread Loaf's
partnerships with teachers and schools raise tough questions for faculty
and administrators about calendars, teaching assignments and schedules,
compensation, and other realities of academic life, the same questions
teachers raise when they are urged or directed to add on-going professi
onal development to their schedules, and to bear the burden of changes
mandated by others.  For individuals, limited time is the great barrier to
change, including change that comes from productive, long-term
school-college partnerships. </p><p>
Fred Hechinger, writing in the first issue of <i>On Common Ground</i>
about university-school partnerships, noted that reports rarely affect
policy; powerful stories often do.  What follows is one of the stories and
essays written by members of the Rural Teacher Network.  It appeared in
somewhat different form in <i>Bread Loaf Rural Teacher Network</i>.
