The overriding strength of hooks' work is its attempt to link form and
content.  hooks asserts that teaching and learning occur within a
community in which there is "shared commitment"­"a commitment to 'the
desire to learn'" that allows for "education as the practice of
freedom"(40).  Similarly, hooks attempts to create a community within her
text, collecting voices and voicing different experiences and viewpoints. 
She relies on a dialectical structure in which to open up a discourse
about teaching
that includes rather than marginalizes feminist criticism, the teacher as
body, and transgressive pedagogical practices that disassemble traditional
authority structures and hierarchies which have framed traditional
student/teacher relationships. She does an effective job of creating an
accessible yet sophisticated forum which could go a long way towards
facilitating discussion among teachers and between teachers and
students.<p>
The weaknesses of the book come, perhaps inevitably, from hooks_
insistence on the personal as political framework.  Within such a matrix
of praxis, the superficial markers of social and political
identity­class, race, and gender­press the text into a
Black-white dichotomy.  The voices which generally speak in her text are
those of whites and Blacks, a move which flattens out some of the complex
intergroup dynamics that might complicate her liberatory model.  Further,
her emphasis on a feminist theory that actively includes race and class
cannot escape an essentialist tone.  For example, when hooks remembers one
of her courses on African American critical thought, she admits that
"[a]lthough I learned a great deal from this white woman professor, I
sincerely believe that I would have learned even more from a progressive
black professor, because this individual would have brought to the class
that unique mixture of experiential and analytical ways of
knowing­that is, a privileged standpoint" 
(91).  hooks' simultaneous assertion that literature and theory are not
the property of one group or another is problematized through hooks' own
struggle to authorize herself and other Black women.
</p><p> <i>Teaching to
Transgress</i> is an important work precisely because of the difficult
theoretical terrain hooks transits.  The snags that she encounters testify
to the depth of hooks' commitment to the praxis of education.  The
efficacy of this text lies,
then, in its potential to provide a link between educators who wish to
continue the questioning that hooks' text begs.</p><p> 
Ronald Takaki begins <i>A Different Mirror</i> with the assertion that
"[r]ace...has been a social construction that has historically set apart
racial minorities from European immigrant groups" (10).  He goes on to
argue that this construction does not accurately reflect the "rich and
complex mosaic" of American diversity.  The project of his book, then, is
to reflect more authentically the multicultural, multiracial, and
multiethnic American character.  An exhaustively detailed history, <i>A
Different Mirror</i> is an essential primer for anyone interested in
American history and its profoundly multicultural nature.</p><p>
Takaki begins with the "discovery" of America and proceeds through World
War II, devoting chapters of each section to the different experiences of
Native Americans, African Americans, Chicanos, Jews, Chinese, and
Japanese.  Each section reflects carefully on the intertextuality of the
separate narratives, and each chapter points out general divergences as
well as overlap, coalition, and shared experiences of different groups.
For example, he points out that after the Civil War many Southern
plantation owners attempted to replace African American laborers with
Chinese, whom they believed could teach Black workers to be more
industrious.  Similarly, he points out that Mexican and Japanese laborers
struck together in California in 1903, complicating common
perceptions of interracial competition.  In fact, the overriding motive
of Takaki's project seems to be to confound stereotypes and historical
accounts which stress violence and tension, rather than coalition and
exchange.  Takaki does not ignore the more conflictive aspects of
multiculturalism, but he shows that they are only part of the story of
America.</p><p>
Takaki's work should be required reading for anyone teaching in a field of
American Studies.  It is particularly valuable as a revision of earlier
works on immigration and culture, like Thomas Sowell's <i>Ethnic
America</i>, which tends to strengthen rather than diminish prevalent
racial stereotypes.  At the same time, the breadth of Takaki_s book
necessarily results in less depth, particularly in analyzing the more
profoundly transcultural, transracial moments.  When he presents the
example of the Chinese/Black labor situation in the South, he does not
really unpack the ambivalence of the historical moment.  The racist
intentions of the Southern plantation owners were undermined by their
determination to racially hybridize their labor force.  Such moments point
to the power of transformation that such hybridity can ultimately effect.
In other words, if race is a social construction, then America_s history
needs to be figured as transracial, as well as multiracial. Takaki
suggests these transracial moments, usually through examples of coalition,
but he does not often push his discussion past the notion of cooperation.
</p><p>
Such a hesitation in the book does not in any way diminish its value as a
primer for multicultural American history.  In fact, such moments of
silence should encourage thoughtful readers to research beyond the text
and begin to examine the sources from which Takaki's work emerges.  For if
this book excites such curiosity, then Takaki has fulfilled the ideal of
scholarship.  We cannot ask for more from such a competent and
comprehensive scholar.
