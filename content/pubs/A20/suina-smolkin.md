The Rural-Urban Teacher Education Program was developed at the University
of New Mexico in 1993 in response to the ever-growing need for more
meaningful teacher training for diverse student populations.  Since the
trend has been for fewer minority students to enter the teaching
profession, another program objective was to recruit more minorities.  In
this case, American Indian students were targeted in our state where the
Native youth far outnumber teachers of their culture.  An additional
purpose was to provide in-service training for mentor teachers in the
program.<p>
The concept of the Rural-Urban program emerged from our concerns as
professors in a long-standing teacher education program which did not
adequately address issues of minority teacher recruitment and more
relevant preparation for diverse populations of children. We believed that
our students would think more deeply about appropriate teaching for given
populations if they had the opportunity to contrast student teaching in
one setting with student teaching in another, very distinct setting.  The
long-standing program had established excellent links with the large urban
school district, but had done little to address teaching outside of
Albuquerque. Within the large rural areas of our state, impressive
diversity can be found from one community to another. 
</p><p>
We decided to take advantage of the uniqueness of particular rural
communities by working with the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Agency
located closest to our University. This would allow our students to
contrast the school lives of children in a huge urban district of more
than 80,000 students with those in the small BIA schools on rural Indian
reservations.  It would further create partnerships between the mentoring
teachers in the urban districts and those in reservation schools,
affording veteran teachers opportunities to contemplate issues of
diversity as well.  We knew, however, that merely placing students in
unique field assignments would not guarantee a change in their ways of
thinking and behaving.  Consequently, we added yet another layer of
partnerships by recruiting American Indian students, partnering each one
with a non-Indian student from the regular College of Education pool,
thereby insuring that one partner would serve as a resource for the other
in each of the two settings.</p><p>
While the notion of partnerships between a university and a school is not
unusual, the Rural-Urban program stretches partnerships far beyond the
usual configurations.  As our students work in two very different school
systems, they can observe differences
in administrative procedures as these relate to the day-to-day lives of
children in schools.  For example, the large urban district, while using
standardized testing, emphasizes portfolio assessments.  This contrasts
notably with the heavy emphasis on standardized testing in the Bureau
schools.  Each emphasis impacts teachers_ choices for student work in the
classrooms, with Bureau teachers devoting many hours to preparing their
students for the test.  Administrative decisions are also visible in the
holidays selected for observances.  The urban district tends to follow the
standard prescribed American calendar while the Bureau responds to
traditional Indian religious practice in the days it selected as holidays
for children.</p><p>
Schooling in varied communities may also be impacted by local governing
bodes. In the Indian community the traditional leadership has much more
direct input on the care and welfare of children and their families.
Therefore, proposed program changes in the
school must be clearly understood and approved by the tribal government. 
When schools decide to implement bilingual education in the urban school
district, they only need approval from the school board. However, a
bilingual program for reservation children needs approval from the school
board, the tribal council, and in the case of New Mexico's Pueblos, from
the tribal governor as well.</p><p>
Following long-established practice at our university, we emphasize the
importance of bringing the child's community into the classroom.  Our
non-Indian students' awareness of culturally sensitive issues increases as
they work in the reservation schools.  Like many novice observers of
cultures, they focus first on physical, material manifestations; in the
case of student teachers, the tendency is to translate these into teaching
activities.  </p><p>
With the guidance of the Native American partner, the student teachers are
able to create more culturally relevant learning experiences without
giving offence. For example, many non-Indian students know that Kachina
figurines are important in Pueblo Indian lives. Their Indian partners
guide them in understanding that making light of these religious figures
is a taboo subject in the Eastern Rio Grande Pueblos and steer them away
from such projects as making Kachina figurines from empty toilet paper
rolls. 
</p><p>
At the heart of studying diversity and education are the children in the
classroom. One of our non-Indian students made the comment that the
reservation children carry their unifying culture and out-of-school
relationships comfortably into the classroom.
Their knowledge of the "ways of being" in the Native world translates
into actions that impress all our students as caring and respectful of one
another's well-being. </p><p>
These children, members of a single tribe, diversified only by a small
percentage of children from mixed parentage, contrast notably with those
in the urban public schools with their far greater racial and cultural
mix. Our students observed that although
there was greater diversity in the urban school population, children
tried to conform to "American-Anglo" norms in their efforts to participate
cross-culturally.  Paradoxes such as these become visible to our students
because of the program's model.</p><p>
Work with children contextualized in their communities also provides
topics for mentor teacher seminars. Meeting bimonthly, the mentors from
the BIA schools and the urban district have the opportunity to exchange
thoughts and suggestions.  At a recent meeting, one of the mentors talked
about his difficulties with certain parents in the school's community,
apparently resulting from his report of a possible child abuse situation
some years back. Given the nature of the particular community, this single
action, required by federal law, had rippling effect, leaving parents
suspicious of his every action in the classroom. </p><p>
Mentors in the cohort spoke from their own experiences on related matters. 
A non-Indian teacher currently working in a Bureau school spoke of her use
of school personnel from the community to defuse similar situations. An
Indian teacher shared insights that lessened the intensity of the problem,
noting that trust might take time to restore but was a definite
possibility.  She went on to suggest some ways that this could be
possible. Discussions of this type have enabled the mentor teachers who
work with our program to understand their own situations better, as well
as to gain insight into the various cultural backgrounds and even
individual lives of their students. Like our student teachers, our mentors
profit from cross-cultural contrasts, growing in their understanding that
there is no single perfect approach to schooling.</p><p>
The Rural-Urban Program has made great strides in reaching its three
overarching goals. Non-Indan students, relating and responding to their
Indian partners' world views and knowledge bases, expand their sensitivity
and confidence in dealing with the range of cultural issues involved in
working with the increasing diversity in today's schools. Indian students,
encouraged and supported by their non-Indian partners, see themselves as
capable of working in a world that extends beyond their reservation
borders.  Both Indian and non-Indian student graduates of the program have
found employment in each other_s worlds and are functioning confidently
and successfully in those settings. </p><p>
Because of the pro-gram's partnering of student teachers, it cannot
function without continued recruitment of Indian partners.  As the program
is in demand, even outside of our state, we are constantly interested in
meeting Indian individuals who express a desire to teach. School
paraprofessionals continue to be our best source of recruits because of
their experiences with children and schools, as well as their ability to
bring course credits they have received during school in-services.  </p><p>
For many of them, this opportunity to continue and finish college work in
a supportive environment which specifically honors them for their cultural
knowledge is a dream fulfilled.  Mentor teachers, who previously have
expressed a sense of isolation and lack of acknowledgment of their
continued efforts on behalf of the children they serve, now find
themselves as members of a supportive cohort. They are well-aware that
their combined knowledge of working with cultural diversity far exceeds
the book knowledge of the ivory tower university professor.  Their
expertise is not only recognized by their student teachers and their
fellow mentors but also by the two of us as professors.<br/>
The program benefits all its participants, including the two of us.
Working with students and mentors in thought-provoking, ever-changing,
authentic situations has been far more rewarding than presenting the
notions of culture found within the confines of
the pages of a book.
