On Common Ground:
Diversity, Partnership, and Community</h2> 
<font size="+1">By Thomas R. Whitaker</font> 
</center><hr/>
The
image on our cover seems a delicate abstraction, a subtle study in tones
and shades.  And that is how the painter himself, Byron Kim, often chooses
to see it.  But its title Synecdoche­that figure of speech in which a
part stands for the whole­offers a clue to its representational
content and figurative meanings.  Synecdoche is composed of hundreds of
small panels, each based on close observation of one person's skin color
on a forearm or the back of the neck.  Kim's subjects include friends
and family, randomly selected visitors to the Brooklyn Public Library,
where he teaches adult literacy, students at Pratt Institute and the
School for Visual Arts in Manhattan, and students at the Blackham Middle
School in Bridgeport, Connecticut.  The part stands for the whole?  Each
panel then is a whole person.  And each panel or person also suggests and
participates in the larger whole‹a remarkable American design of
diversity, partnership, and community.  And so, employing our own
synecdoche, we choose the vision of this Korean-American painter to stand
for the entire Number #7 of <i>On Common Ground,</i> which is devoted to
just
such possibilities.<p>
We are concerned here with several kinds of diversity and community,
which often overlap each other.  And we are concerned with several models
of school-university partnership.  Each essay will stake out its own
ground and view matters from its own perspective.  We have made no attempt
to include all possible points of view, but we invite responses from our
readers that may help to round out our treatment of these issues.  It
should be clear that the "matrix" of this discussion‹to borrow a term
that
Byron Kim has used for his exhibitions and that Manuel N. Gómez
will apply to our psycho-social context­is the larger community of
communities, external and internal, in which we live and have our being.
We have all heard much in recent years about our individual and group
rights.  But, as Christopher Lasch has passionately contended in his book
<i>The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</i>, we have
heard
too
little about the community participation that is also inherent in our very
nature, and about the responsibilities that it lays upon us. 
School-university partnerships will hardly gain a sure foothold in this
country if not accompanied by some vision of the community that will
sustain our diversity.  To that end we offer these
essays.</p>
<h3>The Essays:  Some Connections</h3> 
The possibilities adumbrated in Byron Kim's design, of course, are yet to
be fully realized
in American democracy and in the education it provides for its young
people.  In our feature essay, Manuel Gómez argues that it "is all
too tempting to lose
faith in education right now," and he gives us a sad bill of particulars
to support that impression.  We need, he says, a firmer philosophical
grounding for our vision.  We "have failed to believe in diversity as
intrinsic to the survival of a democratic
society."  And, in focusing on differences between individuals and
groups, we have not grasped the fact of diversity within ourselves.  We
must recognize that our identities are not fixed in some binary
opposition‹black-white, native-foreign, ourselves-other.  Rather, "we
exist within a complex matrix of shifting identities, both within and
between ourselves."  (Each part then stands for the whole!) Grounding
ourselves in that recognition, we may tackle the task of a "reinvigoration
of intellect at all levels of education," an effort that will require "a
liberal arts
emphasis which values the liberatory consequences of intellectual
inquiry."  With Richard Hofstadter and Jacques Barzun, Manuel Gómez
understands "intellect" to be the critical, creative, and contemplative
side of mind, which can become the
"communal form of live intelligence."  One of the "most democratic of
civic virtues," it requires that educators "model the ideal of a
collaborative, egalitarian community."  Only by moving
in that direction, he says, can we find a sound basis for our educational
partnerships.  That vision requires our leap of faith.<p> 
We turn then to three essays from the New Haven experience which may
bolster our
faith.  Each is by a member of the Yale faculty who has worked with the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, and who can speak to the benefits
gained from partnership with teachers in the schools.  And each, in its
own way, deals with the complex intersection of communities.  Howard Lamar
tells how he explored, with his seminar community of schoolteachers, the
history of that larger and continually changing urban community, New
Haven.  Richard Brodhead tells of the dialectical interaction between
teachers in the university and those in the schools, through which both
can broaden and enrich their own understanding of a possible educational
community.  And Bryan Wolf tells how, through working with school teachers
and their students, he discovered ways in which he might refocus his own
university teaching so that it does ampler justice to the richness of
racial and ethnic communities in America.
</p><p> 
Janet Ray Edwards then
deals with the impelling national need of building educational communities
around issues of ethnic and cultural diversity.  She summarizes the work
of several collaboratives among the many that have been sponsored by the
National Endowment for the Humanities.  There is "Texts and Traditions: 
the Common Ground," which brings English faculty at the University of
Houston together with high school English teachers from six metropolitan
school districts.  There is "Joining Hands in the
Teaching of American Literature," a similar collaborative involving
teachers at Otterbein College and in the Columbus, Ohio, schools.  There
is a University of Maryland project on Shakespeare which has evolved a
state-wide collaborative, the Center Alliance of Secondary School
Teachers, which takes scholars to teachers in their own counties.  And
there is "Texts and Teachers:  Themes in Comparative Literature," which
brings to Brown University teams of high school and college teachers from
local sites selected from across the nation.  Edwards suggests how
adaptable is the approach of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute to an
array of different settings and thematic emphases.</p><p> 
James W.
Pipkin gives us a closer look at the detailed structure and accomplishment
of the Houston project, stressing the ways in which its multicultural
curriculum has avoided a sentimental insistence that "we're really all
alike" and has also understood
that difference and division are not the ultimate facts of our situation. 
In doing so, he offers yet another definition of an educational "community
of peers" in relation to a "community of books."  The books constitute a
community, he says, "not in the sense of a monolithic or monovocal entity
but in the sense of a dynamic process in which the texts constantly
interact, allow for exchange of ideas, and exert a reciprocal influence on
one another."</p><p> 
We turn then to a pair of essays that deal with the
question of a multicultural curriculum at the university level.  While not
speaking directly of partnerships, they suggest, as Janet Ray Edwards has
indicated, a major part of the context in which such partnerships must now
be conceived.  Ronald Takaki, author of <i>A Different Mirror:  A History
of
Multicultural America</i>, offers a brief account of the much-debated ways
in
which teachers at the University of California, Berkeley, have addressed
the need to provide students with comparative multicultural experience. 
Richard Brodhead extends this theme with some thoughtful comments on the
advantages and problems inherent in an "inclusionistic" curriculum.  He
also provides an account (in some ways rather like
Bryan Wolf's) of one scholar's redirection of his writing and teaching so
that they would more fully engage our diversity.  Both essays make clear
that such directions in university teaching and research have close
relevance indeed to the concerns of schools that serve multicultural
constituencies‹and also to schools that need to open their students'
minds and imaginations to the cultural diversity that surrounds them.
</p><p> We round out this issue with a series of essays about partnerships
that have engaged a variety of ethnic, racial, or regional communities. 
First of all, Patricia McGrath and Felix Galaviz describe the Puente
Project, focusing on the Mexican-American/Latino community, which is now
operating in 31 community colleges and 18 high schools throughout
California.  
</p><p> 
Carol Booth Olson then offers an account of acollaboration that has
brought together Teacher/Consultants from the University of California,
Irvine, site of the National Writing Project.  The participants, who
represent eleven different school districts a nd seven colleges, have
designed lessons based on the UCI Writing Project's Thinking/Writing model
and on multicultural literature that they have judged appropriate to the
needs of their students in various schools.  The result: a higher level of
understanding for the teachers, an increase in both pride and tolerance in
the students, and renewed inspiration for reading, writing, and
thinking.</p><p> 
Richard Simonelli then discusses the holistic focus of
"indigenous education," as grounded in the traditions of Indian cultures
on this continent, and its incorporation in partnerships based at Cornell
University, Northeastern State University in Oklahoma, and elsewhere.  In
a closely related piece, Joseph H. Suina and Laura B. Smolkin describe the
Rural-Urban Teacher Education Program developed at the University of New
Mexico, which, working with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, places
non-Indian student teachers in schools on rural Indian
reservations­under the guidance of Indian partners.
</p><p> 
Dixie
Goswami then sets forth the work of the Bread Loaf Rural Teacher Network,
which recruits rural teachers from six states­Alaska, Arizona,
Mississippi, New Mexico, South Carolina, and Vermont­to study at the
Bread Loaf School in Vermont and to remain in contact through the computer
network, BreadNet, as well as face-to-face meetings in various parts of
the country.  These partnerships have led to substantial rethinking of
educational and curricular organization in the cooperating schools.  
</p><p> 
We reprint here an essay by one of the members of the Rural Teacher
Network, Phil Sittnick.  He describes his work at the Laguna Pueblo Indian
Reservation in New Mexico, in a middle school designed, built, and
operated by the tribe.  The tribal members want their children to be
prepared both for life in the world of the pueblo and for life beyond the
reservation's boundaries.  Phil Sittnick's participation in BreadNet has
encouraged, among other things, the establishment of an Internet node at
Laguna Middle School­thus providing some important ways through which
Laguna students can be in touch with a world beyond the reservation.
</p><p>
Our occasional department, "Student Voices,"  includes a report by
Rev. Frederick J. Streets, Chaplain and Pastor at Yale University, on his
work as facilitator for a focus-group discussion with African-American
high school students.  Rev. Streets has found important reinforcement
there for Manuel Gómez's argument that each of us exists,
internally and externally, as an individual who belongs to a variety of
groups.  Our real diversity and community are clearly distorted by the
usual political rhetoric of bi-polar opposition.  In a complementary piece
in "Voices from the Classroom," Sharon Floyd tells us how a Saginaw High
program is meeting some of the needs specified by Rev.  Streets for a
curriculum that will affirm the individual, the group, andthe larger
community.</p><p> 
In our review department, Manuel Gómez calls to
our attention two remarkably different books.  <i>Teaching to
Transgress,</i>
by
bell hooks, is an impassioned polemic for the inclusion in our teaching of
what has too often been excluded.  Ronald Takaki's
<i>A Different Mirror</i> is a scholarly and revisionist history of the
multicultural contributions to the life of this nation.  As Gómez
indicates, both of these works should provoke us to further thought and
action.</p>
<h3>The Images:  Some Perspectives</h3> 
Another
image for diversity, partnership, and community is provided by Romare
Bearden's vivid and subtle collage entitled <i>Conjunction,</i> which
appears on
page 4.  Bearden's mind and art were nourished by African-American
culture, by a broad range of classical and contemporary Western painters,
from Vermeer and de Hooch to George Grosz and Henri Matisse, by Chinese
calligraphy and landscapes, by Persian prints, Zen Buddhism, and much
more.  His effective community was both local and international.  Much of
its import is summarized by Conjunction, an image of human meeting that
also depicts and enacts a meeting of many kinds of shapes, patterns,
textures, materials, directions, and spaces.<p> 
With Manuel Gómez's essay, on page 5, we include a mural from the
Cross-Cultural Center at the University of California at Irvine.  This
mural, commissioned by the National Institute of Mental Health for the
National Conference on Refugee Services,
and undertaken as a class project by UCI students, depicts the "silent
suffering" of Asian/Vietnamese and Latino/Central American refugee
communities.  But its symbols of traditional and modern healing arts and
faith (given us with something of José Orozco's power) point beyond
this suffering toward a new American community.</p><p> 
Bryan Wolf
discusses Martin Puryear's sculpture <i>To Transcend,</i> depicted on page
12, as a powerful image for the experience of a university faculty-member
who is rethinking, in the context of a partnership, his relation to the
surrounding cultural diversity.  And the other images in this number of
<i>On
Common Ground </i>will bring to mind certain aspects of that
diversity­both social and artistic­and the perspectives upon
community that are possible within it.</p><p> 
To accompany the essays by James Pipkin and Ronald Takaki, with their
emphasis on "One and Yet Many"
and "E Pluribus Unum,"  we include <i>4-B,</i> a heart-warming painting of
1937
by Louise Emerson Rönnebeck that hopefully depicts the school as a
site of diversity and community.  Rönnebeck was the wife of the
sculptor Arnold Rönnebeck, director of the Denver Art Museum.  In the
attic of their Denver home, next door to Steck Elementary School (which
was attended by their two children), she painted
many scenes of school children.</p><p> 
<i>Aged Tutor and Young Students,</i> by Harrison Begay, on page 24, which
accompanies Richard Simonelli's essay on indigenous education, is one of
several paintings in which this Navajo artist has depicted with modern
stylization the traditional scene of instruction.  The symbolic content of
that instruction is laid out before us in the floating background­as
if in a beautiful sand-painting that has become vertical.</p><p> 
The
intensely registered forms in the painting on page 28 by Jennifer
Paytiamo, a student at Laguna Middle School, not only represent her New
Mexico landscape but also suggest to us­in those dark plateaus so
sharply and ominously divided by a river gorge, and in the sun-drenched
horizon&amp;#`73;another figure for our present divisions and the need to
bridge them.</p><p> 
Faith Ringgold, in the delightful quilt fantasy on
page 29, <i>Double Dutch on the Golden Gate Bridge</i>, offers from her
African-American perspective a symbolic resolution of this predicament: 
we must look to the children!  Though technology has enabled the
construction of our most famous bridges, this bridge-effect seems to be
provided by playful children who float eerily above the horizon of
skyscrapers even as they are doing Double-Dutch on a street in front of
their apartment houses.  But this visionary bridging, of course, has also
been constructed by an artist who has turned a traditional woman's craft
into a subtle aesthetic and social medium­and who reminds us of that
conjunction in her frame of floral prints.</p><p> 
Finally, on the back
cover, we include <i>Bicentennial</i>, by the Menominee/Winnebago artist
Anthony
Gauthier, which forcefully and deftly employs the techniques of the
political poster to alert us to the collaboration required by our
unfinished business as a nation.  Chief Joseph and Martin Luther King join
here, above reminders of a history of violence and slavery, to point
toward a better way.<br/>
