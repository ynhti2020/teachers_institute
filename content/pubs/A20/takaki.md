<h2>Multiculturalism as Common Ground</h2>
<font size="+1">By Ronald Takaki</font>
</center><hr/>
America seems to be not fraying but rather splitting apart.  Our divisions
are at the center rather than the edges of our society.  Assimilationist
pundits urge us to embrace the "melting pot" by emphasizing individuality
rather than group membership.  On
the other hand, ethnic separatists promote an exclusive ethnicity that
sometimes degrades other groups.<p>
Both the assimilationists and the separatists are clamoring for a
curriculum that narrowly views history from one side or the other, and the
clash between the two perspectives has come to be called the "culture
wars."  In the face of this dilemma educators must ask:  Is there a third
way, one that invites all of us to reach toward an understanding of
ourselves as <i>e pluribus unum</i>?</p><p>
In l989, the faculty at the University of California addressed this
question and approved a multicul-tural graduation requirement designed to
deepen and broaden understanding of American society in terms of our
ethnic and racial diversity.  This is not an
additional requirement; rather it simply stipulates that one of the four
breadth courses in the social sciences and humanities required for
graduation must have a multicultural content.  In order to qualify for the
list of courses satisfying this requirement, the course must study<b>
comparatively</b> the histories and cultures of at least three of five
groups:  African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanics, American Indians,
and European immigrants.  Currently, Berkeley offers some 80 courses from
over fifteen departments that fulfill this requirement.  The main
objective of the Berkeley faculty in establishing this curriculum
innovation is to provide a more accurate understanding of the complexity
of American society.</p><p>
One of the courses that meets the American Cultures Requirement is my
course on racial inequality in America, a comparative historical
perspective.  Lectures and readings analyze the experiences of all five of
the groups.  The primary textbook is my study, <i>A Different Mirror:  A
History of Multicultural America</i>.  Students are also introduced to
other perspectives­for example, Nathan Glazer, William Julius Wilson,
Richard Rodriguez, Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Paula Gunn Allen, Derrick
Bell, and Thomas Sowell.  All of us in the classroom engage in dialogue,
even debate; all I ask is that the discussions be conducted with
civility.</p><p>
The problem with many of the readings is that they tend to be group
specific, focusing, say, only on Blacks, or Chicanos.  Thus it becomes a
challenge for the students and myself to explore the idea that our diverse
voices are not disparate but part of a larger narrative.  In pursuing this
idea, we study the ways the economy historically has connected a diverse
assemblage of Americans.  Nineteenth-century Irish immigrants worked in
New England factories manufacturing textiles from cotton cultivated by
enslaved Blacks on lands taken from Indians and Mexicans.  In Northern
cities, Blacks and Irish competed for jobs as dock workers and domestic
servants.  Like Blacks, the Irish were stereotyped as "savages," ruled by
passions rather than the "civilized" virtues of hard work and self-conrol.
</p><p>
Different ethnic groups were frequently pitted against one another.  In
1870, Chinese immigrants were transported from California to Massachusetts
to break an Irish immigrant strike.  That same year, Mississippi planters
recruited Chinese immigrants to discipline newly-freed Blacks.</p><p>
But there were also instances of inter-ethnic labor solidarity and
empathy.  In 1903, Mexican and Japanese farm workers struck together in
California.  Their union officers had names like Lizarras and Yamaguchi,
and strike meetings were conducted in Spanish and Japanese.  Speaking in
impassioned Yiddish during the 1909 garment workers_ strike in New York,
Clara Lemlich compared the abuse of Jewish laborers to the experience of
Blacks:  "[The bosses] yell at the girls and 'call them down' even worse
than I imagine the Negro slaves were in the South".</p><p>
But, we ask ourselves, is there something more than the economy that makes
all of us one people?  America's very history as a nation has been
multicultural.  Blacks fought beside whites in the War for Independence. 
During the Civil War, 186,000 Blacks served in the Union Army.  During
World War II, the defenders of our nation included Navajos from the
reservations, Chicanos from the barrios, African Americans from the
ghettos, and even Japanese Americans from U.S. internment camps.  These
groups struggled for a "double victory"­against fascism abroad and
racism at home.</p><p>
By participating in our nation's struggles, America_s different ethnic
groups have advanced a more inclusive understanding of what Abraham
Lincoln described as a nation dedicated to the "proposition" of equality.
But what was defended during the Civil War continues to be "unfinished
work."  Now we face the challenge of defining "equality."  Do we mean
equality of opportunity or of condition?  Is equality political, or is it
also economic and cultural?  How do we achieve equality?  Is the situation
in the
U. S. different from the "ethnic cleansing" in Bosnia and the bloody
Muslim-Hindu clashes in India, or do ethnic conflicts elsewhere represent
our prologue?  Is there a deep need for group identity rooted in hatred
for the other?  Will equality for America remain just a "proposition?"</p><p>
These tough questions have stirred intense debate and division among us as
Americans.  But, as we grapple with them, we should not allow ourselves to
be distracted and divided by shouting matches between ardent
assimilationists and shrill separatists.  For indeed, there is a third
way, offering us a more accurate history as well as a more complete
comprehension of who we are as Americans.
