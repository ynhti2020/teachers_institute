<center><h2>Collaboration as Community</h2>
<fonte size="+1">by Janet Ray Edwards

This issue of <i>On Common Ground</i> explores a specific and impelling
need:  that of building educational communities around issues of ethnic
and cultural diversity in American society at large.  Together, as
scholars, teachers, and students, we seek to
discern what is distinctive in our varying cultural traditions and
identify what binds us together as Americans.  As school teachers look at
the faces of their students, more often than not they see cultural
diversity embodied.  In this situation, they hunger for the academic
enrichment­the knowledge of history and culture­that will make
them more effective and responsive teachers.  Food is available.  In the
colleges and universities, humanities scholars have been searching new or
neglected primary texts and documents, seeking to place them in
appropriate cultural and intellectual contexts.  To a school-college
partnership, these searches bring the intellectual resources that can help
teachers understand the roots and branches of American diversity. 
Moreover, as scholars collaborate with teachers, they report a resurgence
of interest in their own, increasingly diverse classrooms.  In teachers
they find colleagues who may have lacked the time to specialize in
scholarly matters but who read with intelligence and imagination.  Such a
collaborative builds a community of scholars and teachers who address a
challenging question:  how to engage students with intellectual content
informed by scholarship, through practical, imaginative strategies.<p>
These ideas sum up concrete experiences taking place in collaborativs
sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) across the
nation.  Since l989, English faculty at the University of Houston in an
NEH-sponsored project entitled "Texts and Traditions:  the Common Ground"
have been meeting with high school English teachers from six metropolitan
school districts in a series of concurrent seminars each summer.  Pairing
commonly taught works of American literature with works by minorities and
women that are less well known, teachers and scholars think together
about the question, "What is American about American literature?"  In the
sessions I visited, one seminar explored two novels that treat a similar
theme­the claims of society on the individual­in strikingly
different ways.  The discussion contrasted Huckleberry Finn's defiance of
conventional society in "lighting out for the territory" with the ending
of Rudolfo Anaya's <i>Bless Me, Ultima</i>, in which the child narrator
becomes the bridge-builder bringing together disparate societal forces. In
a second seminar, teachers explored the contrast between Franklin's
account of the "junto" or reading group that supported his learning with
Frederick Douglass' commentary on the isolation and negativity that
surrounded his learning.  Such discussions, teachers agreed, helped them
to gain a richer, more complex sense of what constitutes American society
than had been available to them through traditional readings alone.</p><p>
A group of teachers meeting with me after the seminar spoke of their deep
satisfaction at the chance to talk with teachers from their own and other
schools about books an ideas.  In the collaboration, they experienced the
kind of intellectual community that they wished to build in their own
schools, and not with faculty only.  Teachers as well as two of the
district language coordinators with whom I met later described the
"tomblike atmosphere" among minority students in many classes.  One of the
coordinators who regularly visited classrooms and talked with teachers
said, "These students are no trouble.  They don't act out.  They just
become quieter and more withdrawn, until one day they disappear from the
class."  For a Hispanic school child who, for example, had never
encountered a book by a Hispanic writer or heard discussions of the
importance of Hispanic culture in contributing to American society, the
chance to read Anaya's <i>Bless Me, Ultima</i> or Cisneros' <i>House on
Mango Street</i> under the guidance of an informed teacher could make a
significant difference in that child_s engagement with school learning.</p><p>
To ensure that interactions between teachers and students in their
classrooms are nourished by a larger intellectual community, the Houston
project has set for itself the goal of reaching a "critical mass" of high
school English teachers.  To date, over three hundred have participated
directly in the summer seminars, with many more involved through
dissemination projects offered within the schools by the teachers
themselves.  With confidence that the university is an ongoing resource
and with the support of school district curriculum coordinators, teachers
are emerging as leaders in their own schools.</p><p>
The Houston collaboration drew both intellectual and practical inspiration
from the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute and the generous leadership of
Yale scholar Michael Cooke.  Once the Houston partnership was itself
established­its steadiness reflected in part by the fact that five of
the eight original faculty still participate in the project­Houston
faculty member Linda Westervelt, with NEH encouragement, took the next
step.  Her conversations with Beth Daugherty, a faculty member at Otterbe
in College near Columbus, Ohio, led Otterbein faculty to design a similar
collaborative.  </p><p>
"Joining Hands in the Teaching of American Literature," the
Otterbein-Columbus partnership, takes as its premise that, "effectively
taught, American literature in all its richness can unite rather than
divide society."  One summer, intellectual sparks flew as school and
college teachers discussed such pairings as Henry David Thoreau's
<i>Walden</i> and William Least-Heat Moon's <i>PrairyErth</i>; Ernest
Hemingway's <i>In Our Time</i> with Toni Morrison's <i>Sula</i>; Nathaniel
Hawthorne's <i>House of the Seven Gables</i> with Octavia Butler's
<i>Kindred</i>.  Teachers returned to their schools that fall
reinvigorated to begin building communities of inquiry with other teachers
and with students in their classrooms.</p><p>
But the power of school-college partnership to build communities of
inquiry is not limited to a single structural model or a single content
focus.  A draft statement from the U. S. Department of Education links
successful education reform throughout the United States to the
"career-long development of teachers and other educators" and recommends
that strategies to improve teaching and learning be "collaboratively
designed, implemented, coordinated and evaluated by schools and higher
education institutions."  "High-quality professional development," the
statement goes on, "also promotes 'learning communities' inclusive of
everyone who has an impact on students and their learning."<font size="-1"><b>1</b></font> At NEH, other collaborative ventures with distinctive
characteristics abound, though space allows mention of only two.  From a
University of Maryland project on Shakespeare evolved a state-wide
collaborative, the Center Alliance of Secondary School Teachers (CAST). In
a reversal of the usual emphasis on bringing teachers to the university,
CAST takes scholars to teachers in their own counties.  As university
faculty becme more knowledgeable about school curricula, they are
increasingly able to tailor their offerings to specific school needs.  In
response, the schools support CAST in their budgets.  For example, when
Baltimore County English teachers were faced with a new mandate to teach
world literature at the ninth and tenth grade levels­literature the
teachers had never studied­they turned to CAST, which responded with
an academic-year study course that made the requirement both feasible and
exciting.</p><p>
Another imaginative conception brings together like-minded school
reformers for study at a single, national site and returns them to their
own communities to found particular, local, effective, teacherly
collaborations.  Invigorated by its ongoing partnership with Providence
schools that began in l988, a coalition of forces within Brown
University­Arnold Weinstein of the comparative literature department; 
Sharon Lloyd Clark and Laura Mack at the university's Institute for
Secondary Education; and the Coalition for Essential Schools, headed by
Theodore Sizer­proposed a collaborative project national in scope but
local in effect.  "Texts and Teachers:  Themes in Comparative Literature" 
brings together teams of four high school and two college teachers from
four local sites selected from across the nation, from Boston to Whittier,
California, from Tougaloo, Mississippi, to Chicago.</p><p>
For two weeks each summer, the four teams engage in intensive study of
selected literary classics of Western, Asian, and African literature,
working together to deepen their grasp of the principles of comparative
literary study and to develop strategies for introducing these texts to
their students.  For example, a seminar on "Rites of Passage" has explored
the paradigm of coming of age as represented in major texts from different
nations and different moments in history­Chrétien de Troy's
<i>Yvain</i> from the European middle ages, Cao Xuequin_s
eighteenth-century text <i>The Story of the Stone</i>, Charlotte
Bronte's<i> Jane Eyre</i>, William Faulkner's <i>Go Down, Moses</i>, and
Alice Walker's <i>The Color Purple</i>.  In a seminar session I visited,
talk about how Faulkner's Ike McCaslin learns to read bear tracks led to a
discussion of learning to read as the great rite of passage in our
culture, and so back to the realities of teaching and learning.</p><p>
When the teams return to their local sites, meetings are scheduled
throughout the academic year.  Each teacher implements a course using
several of these tactics for classes of high school juniors and seniors or
college freshmen.  Several times during the year, the high school and
college classes come together to discuss a shared text.  Already some of
these local projects are taking root on their own soil, as they adapt the
texts studied with colleagues from across the country to local conditions
and needs.</p><p>
One teacher-participant in the seminar on "Desire in the Marketplace" 
wrote that in his class at Hope High School in Providence, "we are
currently finishing up <i>Madame Bovary </i>and will soon read <i>So Long
a Letter</i> and <i>The Joys of Motherhood</i>." These texts show students
the differences and the similarities between 20th century Africa and l8th
century Europe.  He continues, "We are able to build bridges to our own
lives with these texts and begin to talk about ourselves through these
texts. These texts have helped the students connect to literature."
