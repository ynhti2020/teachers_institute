One, and Yet Many</h2> 
<font size="+1">By James W. Pipkin</font>

In<i> The Souls of Black Folk</i>, W.E.B. DuBois
expresses his sense of his "double-consciousness."  Similarly, Nathaniel
Hawthorne in "The Custom-House" sketch draws a distinction between his
"figurative" self and his "real" self.  The pairing of these two voices
and the vision of "doubleness" that both authors express­but in
distinctively different ways­typify the approach to multicultural
studies taken by "Texts and Tradition:  The Common Ground," an educational
partnership program between the College of Humanities, Fine Arts, and
Communication at the University of Houston and seven of the largest
independent school districts in the greater Houston metropolitan area. 
<p> 
If "The Common Ground," as it is called by its participants, makes a
contribution to teaching and learning about cultural diversity, it is
based upon the belief that the study of American literature must recognize
the opposing claims of commonality and distinctiveness.  While these
counter terms do indeed reflect a tension that can threaten to collapse
discussion into divisiveness, at their best they become the opposing yet
positive and complementary terms that can stimulate a candid conversation
about wa ys of defining and understanding the sense of identity and
community that have shaped the American experience.  The project's
approach encourages a re-examination of the applicability to our current
debates of the traditional motto, <i>E Pluribus Unum</i> .</p><p> 
"America," says the narrator at the end of Ralph Ellison's <i>Invisible
Man</i>, "is
woven of many strands; I would recognize them and let it so remain....Our
fate is to become one, and yet many­This is not prophecy, but
description."  "The Common Ground" recognizes this defining trait of
America by choosing as its shaping structure the concept of pairings.  The
various seminars we offer each summer for high school English teachers
have reading selections that are organized by pairing works that have
long been included in the "canon" with significant works written by
minority authors.  For example, we pair such works as:</p><p> 
Benjamin Franklin's <i>Autobiography</i> with Frederick Douglass's
<i>Narrative of the Life;</i></p><p> 
Zora Neale Hurston's <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God
</i>with Kate Chopin's <i>The Awakening</i>;</p><p> 
Walt Whitman's<i>Song of Myself </i>with Rudolfo Gonzales's <i>I Am 
Joaquin;</i>
</p><p> Henry James's <i>The Europeans</i> with Luis Chu's<i> Eat a Bowl of
Tea;</i></p><p> 
Leslie Silko's <i>Ceremony </i>with Willa Cather's <i>My Ántonia;
</i>and</p><p> 
Harper Lee's <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> with Thulani Davis's
<i>1959.</i></p><p>
The implications of the pairings run in two directions. 
The more obvious point is that the great America experiment in democracy
has always been, as Catherine Stimpson has discussed it, a "cultural
democracy" comprised of a diversity of voices.<font size="-1"><b>1</b></font> Although
this view of America has been thoughtfully established by the scholarship
of the last
twenty years, it is still not uncommon to find at the high school level
special units on African American or Mexican American literature.  The
danger of this practice,
well-intentioned as it may be, is that it segregates these works of art
from the usual surveys of "American literature" and runs the risk of
suggesting to the students that they are being studied for social or
political reasons rather than for their literary merit.  The simple but
powerful concept of the pairings is designed to underscore that all of
these voices and all of these literary works together constitute the
American literary tradition, a tradition characterized by its
inclusiveness.  As Diane Ravitch points out, "Paradoxical as it may seem,
the United States has a common culture that is multicultural."<font size="-1"><b>2</b></font></p><p>
The implications of the pairings also move in a counter direction,
however. Because the works are often widely separated by chronology, as
well as by setting and narrative subject­take, for example, the
pairing of Mark Twain's <i>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> with
Rudolfo Anaya's <i>Bless Me, Ultima</i>­the first task is to discover
commonality amid obvious dissimilarity.  This is particularly true when
the grouping is a kind of<i> discordia concors</i>, an apparently violent
yoking to gether of works such as James Fenimore Cooper's <i>The Last of
the Mohicans</i> and Denise Chavez's <i>The Last of the Menu Girls</i>
which share an elegiac view of an American past.  The critical thinking
set in motion by the pairing leads the teachers to focus on what binds
the works together.  The process affirms the simple truth that the poet
William Wordsworth once expressed:  "We have, all of us, one human heart." 
There is a danger, however, if we come away from the study of
multicultural literature with only this simple truth.  Truth may be
simple, but great literature rarely is.</p><p> 
American literature reflects two very different impulses.  On the one
hand, it presents us with overarching myths of America and the American
experience, myths that bind us together.  It reflects democratic ideals
that celebrate the values of community and commonality.  It encourages us
to walk together a common
ground.</p><p> 
But many of our characteristically American works of art are
written in the spirit of inquiry and questioning.  They challenge the
myths that no longer match the actualities of experience.  And they also
challenge the easy and comforting understanding we have of universality by
reminding us of the case of the individual, by suggesting that to get to
the universal we usually have to work through the particular and that the
particular is often different and distinctive rather than common.</p><p> 
As a way of introducing this point of view, we sometimes ask participants
in "The Common Ground" to read Laura Bohannan's essay, "Shakespeare in the
Bush."<font size="-1"><b>3</b></font> Bohannan, an American anthropologist,
was invited by members of a West African tribe to join them in telling
stories.  She chooses as her story the plot of <i>Hamlet</i>. 
She is prepared to explain some details of custom, but she believes that
great tragedies are universal; their themes and the motivations that drive
the plot will always be clear anywhere in the world.  She turns out to be
right, but in a way she never expected.
</p><p> 
The tribe members easily understood <i>Hamlet</i>, but their
interpretation was very different from
Bohannan's.  Almost from the beginning of her tale, they interrupted to
question and disagree with her about most of the key elements in the
story.  They were not at all bothered, for example, by the event that
sets the tragedy in motion­Claudius's marriage to Gertrude.  It is
only right, they argued, that the younger brother should marry his older
brother's widow and become the father of his children. 
This central event reinforced for them the universality of Shakespeare's
art, and they tried to explain to Bohannan the mistakes in her flawed
interpretation of the play.  They were quite happy to chide the
anthropologist, saying, "We told you that if we
knew more about Europeans we would find they really are very much like
us."  The tribesmen scoffed at the notion that Hamlet's father is a ghost
because they don't believe that any individual part of our personality
survives after death.  They also explained Hamlet's madness as the result
of being bewitched by Claudius, who wants to kill him.  And although no
one may kill his father's brother, because Hamlet is mad, they found no
fault in his murder of Claudius.  The story made perfect sense to them. 
It  is understandable, they told Bohannan, because we all share a basic
humanity.</p><p> 
As she reflected upon the experience, Bohannan learned that
the one human heart by which we live is not the entire issue and that we
run the risk of misinterpreting the universal by misunderstanding the
particular.  In discussing the novels, plays, and poems on the reading
lists of "The Common Ground" seminars, we have found it important to
resist the easy temptation to conclude that studying multicultural
literature reveals that "we're really all alike."  Difference and division
are not the final vision either.  They are, however, often the necessary
point of departure that we must recognize if we are to see American life
honestly and see it whole.
</p><p> 
The University of Houston has hosted "The
Common Ground" since 1989, and it has become one of the largest
university-school collaboratives in the country.  The hope of the
participants­both the high school teachers and the university
teachers­is
that they are building a community of peers, whatever the differences in
the forums in which they work.  We realize, however, that the real common
ground is the "community of books" that we study.  They constitute a
community not in the sense of a monolithic or monovocal entity but in the
sense of a dynamic process in which the texts constantly interact, allow
for exchange of ideas, and exert a reciprocal influence on one another. 
</p><p> 
The American literary tradition(s), we believe, is based upon the
twin values of continuity and change.  It is a living tradition.  It
includes long-venerated books that cast far shadows, but it also allows
and encourages the inclusion of significant new works of art.  It is a
vital process that must never eliminate the possibility of surprise.  It
remains "one, and yet many," with all the tension, complexity, and
richness such "doubleness" contains.
