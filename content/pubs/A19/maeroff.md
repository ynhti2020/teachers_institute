Model Practices from Professional Schools</h2>
<font size="+1">By Gene I. Maeroff
</font></center><hr/><font size="+1">
Partnerships can sometimes be built in places where people least  suspect
the potential for collaboration. High schools and professional  schools at
universities, for example, may have more in common than  educators on
either side are apt to realize. Advocates of school  reform can find at
the professional schools models of some of the  very practices that they
would like to see adopted by the nation's  high schools. At the same time,
those who desire to improve  professional education have among colleagues
in the secondary  schools people whom they may discover are striving
toward similar  goals.
<p>
Some of the main objectives of educational reform at both levels are
remarkably alike, and paradigms for change can readily be shared.  These
common interests cut across such diverse areas, for example,  as
experiential education, off­campus/out­of­classroom
learning,  integration of the curriculum, and performance assessment.
</p><p>
Activities in two areas of professional education in particular,  medical
schools and architecture schools, illustrate the possible  commonalities.
These two kinds of professional schools are in the  midst of their own
self­examinations, affected albeit by forces far  less turbulent than
those buffeting elementary and secondary  schools. Nonetheless,
conversations between those in high schools  and those in medical and
architectural schools might prove mutually  fruitful.
</p><p>
I have had the opportunity in the last few years to participate in
studies of medical schools and architecture schools, as well as high
schools. Continually, I have been struck by the echoes I hear
reverberating across the normally silent educational divide. Those in
professional schools and their counterparts in high schools would be
surprised to hear­if they could attune themselves to the proper
frequency range­how much their stated educational aspirations  sound
alike.
</p><p>
Take experiential education, for instance. The idea of hands­on
education is all the vogue among would­be reformers at high schools
across the land. Yet, precious few inroads have been blazed to allow
students to go beyond the usual point at which they are passive
recipients of knowledge. Learning by doing remains an unrealized  aim
throughout most of secondary education; even science labs are  sometimes
taught solely as demonstrations.
</p><p>
In architecture schools and medical schools, however, experiential
education often forms a foundation for constructing knowledge. What
better examples exist of learning by doing than architectural  education's
design studio or medical education's clinical clerkship?  Budding
architects and fledgling physicians use the occasion of their  schooling
to perform, in a gradually more sophisticated fashion, some  of the very
tasks that will be central to the practice of their  professions.
</p><p>
This is not to say that these professional schools have unfettered
themselves from passive pedagogy. Quite to the contrary. Design  studios
and medical clinics withstanding, some of the most numbing  teaching and
most mindless rote learning in all of education occurs in  the lecture
courses of schools of medicine and schools of architecture.  At the very
same time, though, these schools exemplify in their  hands­on courses
a level of experiential education that high schools  can only begin to
imagine achieving. Those who would like to imbue  secondary schools with a
stronger sense of experiential education  could do a lot worse than
starting to study how professional schools  carry out this mission.
</p><p>
Considerations of experiential education inevitably lead to the  related
area of off­campus, out­of­classroom learning. Service
learning and expeditionary learning along the Outward Bound model
represent major manifestations of the attempt by high schools to  move
education away from the classroom. But programs of this sort  occupy only
a narrow band of the gamut of secondary school  offerings. More creative
thinking will be required to enlarge the  opportunities of high school
students to learn away from the school.
</p><p>
The traditional model for medical education­with the last two of the
four years of medical school set in clinics­presents a prime example
of how the classroom can be abandoned in behalf of greater learning.  In
fact, medical schools now seek to extend learning even beyond the
hospital clinics that they have used for generations and send medical
students to neighborhood clinics, doctors' private offices, and other
"ambulatory" sites consistent with the locales at which more and  more
physicians actually practice medicine. Proponents of  ambulatory settings
argue that students whose clinical education is  confined largely to the
wards of tertiary hospitals are likely to focus  on pathologies, an
orientation that can lead to a distorted view of the  role of a physician,
especially when prevention looms as ever more  important. Furthermore,
hospital stays today are shorter and more  procedures are performed away
from the hospital operating room.
</p><p>
Architecture schools, too, are slowly coming to the realization that
out­of­classroom learning ought to be part of the regular
curriculum.  Boston Architecture Center, for instance, schedules courses
only in  the evenings so that its students can hold daytime jobs in the
field to  earn academic credits in connection with the school's work
curriculum. The architecture school at the University of Cincinnati
operates as a co­op program so that students can alternate between
the classroom and the architecture office. But most architecture
institutions have been notoriously lax in ensuring that their students
get formal learning experiences away from campus, though students  and
alumni say that this ought to happen.
</p><p>
So far as integrative education is concerned, both secondary schools  and
professional schools need to do more to bridge disciplinary  barriers.
Anyone who knows anything about high schools is aware of  the
fragmentation of knowledge, the utter failure to tie together the
subjects that are taught. This issue pervades much of education.
</p><p>
In most architecture schools, for example, education in the design  studio
often proceeds as if students did not take courses in structures  and
materials, in mechanical and environmental systems, in  professional
practice and in architectural history. Frequently, little  happens in
architecture education to make the design studio an  integrative place
where knowledge from other courses is formally  brought to bear. Such
pockets of exception as the Southern California  Institute of
Architecture, which is trying to involve classicists,  historians, and
other non­design professionals in studio lectures,  desk crits, and
juries, represent an embarrassing challenge to other  architecture
schools.
</p><p>
Similarly, most medical schools continue to adhere to a bifurcated  format
that keeps the basic sciences separate from each other and  unrelated in
any formal way to clinical education. Moreover, course  content tends to
lack coordination, and a student reviews the same  material over and over
in various courses from a slightly different  perspective, perhaps with
only a nod to relationships among the  subject areas.
</p><p>
A promising integrative approach used by an increasing number of  medical
schools exemplified by Canada's McMaster University and  such American
schools as Michigan State University and Southern  Illinois University at
Carbondale calls for a problem­based format  that can be a vehicle
for integration, though the explicit goal may be  to cultivate clinical
reasoning or self­directed learning. Small learning  groups of
students (not unlike cooperative learning on the pre­ collegiate
level, incidentally) seek solutions to problems that usually  cannot be
solved without drawing on the knowledge of several  disciplines.
</p><p>
Such other medical schools as Case Western Reserve University  promote
integration by pulling together the basic sciences in a  coordinated
organ­system approach that blends into the clinical  sciences, as
well. Teams of faculty members from different  departments carry out this
thematic instruction.
</p><p>
But these are the exceptions. For the most part, high schools and
professional schools find it equally difficult to break out of the rigid
departmental structure that separates areas of knowledge. In all of
education, only some middle schools seem able consistently to put
together the teaching teams that readily cross disciplinary lines to
integrate content. Most medical schools, architecture schools, and  high
schools need to find ways to build on these interdisciplinary
accomplishments.
</p><p>
The fourth and final of these areas of potential mutual interest is
performance­based assessment, a subject of so much discussion in
secondary education. The principle that instruction and assessment  are
opposite sides of the same coin has gotten mostly lip service in  high
schools, but medical and architectural education took solid steps  years
ago to embrace the idea though neither of these sectors of  professional
education extends the approach into all areas of the  curriculum.
</p><p>
The basic tenet here is that an excellent way to determine whether a
student has learned to perform a task is to have a student learn it by
performing it, providing summative assessments while the student
gradually builds up the requisite knowledge base and refines the
performance over time. The student strives to perfect his  performance
even as a coach assesses it much like learning to ice  skate by repeatedly
falling down, getting up, and trying again. If  learning means going
through the steps of performing a task until it  has been mastered, then
both carrying out a studio design project in  architecture school or
conducting a physical diagnosis in medical  school are examples of tasks
in which the performance informs both  learning and evaluative dimensions.
</p><p>
The ultimate exhibition of performance based assessment might be  the
objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) in medical school  or the
pin up session in architecture school, two splendid examples  worthy of
emulation by secondary schools. In a full blown OSCE, the  student moves
from station to station, encountering one standardized  patient after
another who simulates symptoms that the student has  to diagnose as he or
she performs discrete clinical tasks while being  observed and marked from
structured check lists. In the pin up, the  student presents and describes
the renderings and models that he or  she has developed to solve the
design problem.
</p><p>
Thus, we see that professional education and pre­collegiate education
share common ground on which to pursue productive discourse.  Clearly, an
agenda could be fashioned that might prove intriguing to  both sectors.
When placed in the larger context of schooling  generally, the reforms
urged on any particular sector of education  can be seen to extend into
the warp and woof of the entire  enterprise. The nature of the changes
often transcends differences in  the ages and sophistication of learners.
