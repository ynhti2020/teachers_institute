The Loud Silence: Locating Student Voices in Partnerships</h2>

We say we collaborate on the behalf of students, and yet curiously,
student voices are almost inaudible when we embark upon our
collaboratives. Why is this? Why are students not part of the  dialogue or
the restructuring efforts in our nation's schools and  universities? Why
do they not sit at the table among educators in an  exchange of ideas?
Shouldn't they participate, actively engage, be  consulted, or at least be
informed of what we as partnerships are  doing on their behalf?
</p><p>
So why are they absent? Could it be ageism? Are we still  unconsciously
wedded to those traditional beliefs that "children  should be seen and not
heard" or that as adults "we know better"?  How can we address the
contradiction of claiming we are inclusive of  all those who have a vested
interest in schools while students are  still noticeably missing? What
role should students play in informing  our work? Should they sit at the
table of the executive committees to  assist in policy making? How do we
negotiate common ground with  students? Perhaps they should be regularly
consulted. Or at the very  least, they could be regularly informed
regarding our restructuring  activities? Incidentally, do these queries
have a vague sound of  familiarity? Didn't we pose these questions when we
initially  considered the empowerment of teachers and site­based
management?
</p><p>
Why is it hard for us to consult those we have systematically  silenced?
Why are we selective with regard to those with whom we  collaborate?
Should students be allowed to be equal partners in  collaboration? What
are the consequences of their participation?  Their lack of participation?
</p><p>
If we were interested in inviting students to inform our work, where
would we start? Roland Barth has compared the separate existence of
teachers and administrators working in the same school buildings to
toddlers who sit side by side in a sandbox, coexisting and sometimes
throwing sand in each other's direction. In time, they share sandbox
toys. Perhaps students could assist partnerships in building stronger
sand castles which respond and change to the waves of reform but  do not
erode with the sands of time.
</p><p>
In 1993, the Partnership Network, a multi­institutional collaborative
of fourteen school districts, two community colleges, a county office  of
education and two universities, housed at the University of  California at
Irvine, California, made an imprint in the sand by  seeking student voices
to advise its Alternative Assessment Project.  Currently in its second
year, the project is aimed at developing  alternative criteria for
university admissions. University and school  personnel are jointly
investigating indicators of success, beyond SAT  scores and A through F
requirements, embedded in portfolios,  projects and performances.
</p><p>
Inspired by Grant Wiggins' work on authentic assessment, teachers  and
administrators, in an attempt to gain a more accurate picture of  a
student's potential, identified multiple ways of measuring student
achievement. University members also deliberated the implication of  this
work in connection with student preparation for entry into the
university. Subsequently, the partnership launched a small pilot  project
to mutually explore alternative criteria for university  admission.
</p><p>
Almost a full year into the work the members of the partnership
recognized that, in its zealous effort to design a matrix of success
indicators, we had not "come to know" the students. How did they  define
success? What were the conditions in their learning  environment that they
perceive contributed to their success? Exactly  who were these people we
were working so hard for? Their  invisibility in the initial
conceptualization and development of the  project cast them into the sea
of anonymity. It was indeed time to  throw sand in this direction.
</p><p>
Students surprised us with what they considered important to their
success. They characterize classroom indicators which they perceived
enabled or inhibited student success. "I don't do well in lectures
because I'm not being asked to use my mind. I need to be actually
involved in the learning," said Christine Lynch, who wrote, casted,
constructed props, staged lighting, and directed a major play for high
school. "I can't learn when the teachers won't let me get help from  my
friends. Talking helps me," said Tamara Contreras, who consulted
regularly with traffic engineers at City Hall while developing a  project
to improve the traffic patterns around her school. Rena Sahib  believes
that her ESL class helped her learn to speak up but also held  her back.
"I didn't know the standards for college because I was in  ESL. I feel
that the kids in ESL are treated lower than others and  don't get pushed
towards college. By not pushing me, they slowed me  down." She made an
oral presentation and showed a comprehensive  newspaper layout on a topic
she investigated, year­long child care.
</p><p>
It was after his third high school and experiences with gangs that  Thomas
Gómez established his roots and began to spend time  working in the
community at car washes to raise money for a  Hispanic street rag, <i>La
Calle,</i>  which encourages young adults to  develop life styles free of
drugs and gangs. He described different  teaching styles he has
experienced in high schools. "There's like three  levels. The first level
is preaching and I don't get a thing out of  preaching. The second level
is conversation where you get to talk  with somebody about it. Then there
is social learning. This is  between the teacher and the student. It' s
when the teacher shows  you something and gives you a chance to show back.
The teachers  here want to know you more than in my other schools. That's
why I  wanted to show them I could do it [participate in the alternative
assessment project]." Thomas and Tamara were the first in their  extended
families to break the cycle of high school dropouts. All four  of these
students will be the first in their families to attend college.
</p><p>
Students named pedagogy and human relationships as critical to  their
success in high school. With candor, they labeled practices  which they
perceived as effective to their success and critiqued those  which were
obstacles. What they had to say only confirmed that we  had a long road to
go in restructuring high school and university  classrooms. But equally
important was the fact that they did have  something significant to say.
In retrospect, by recognizing students as  a valuable resource, the
partnership launched the next year's project  with the assistance of
students who not only mentored the next  group of candidates but also were
invited to accompany partnership  representatives to co­present at a
national conference. Their  classroom descriptions also stimulated the
project to focus more  attention in its second year on classroom teachers.
</p><p>
While student information made a significant contribution to our  work
this year, the question still remains, to what degree will they
participate in the partnership. Just as teachers should take notice  when
students declare, "Stop lecturing at us. Invite us to be active
participants," so we, as partnerships, should ask ourselves, "In our
collaborative efforts to shape better educational opportunities for
students, are we ready to start working with them to become agents  of
change in their own learning destinies?" If we could control the  volume
of partnerships, I would ask that we turn down the silence  and turn up
the student voices.
