Fred M. Hechinger, 1920-1995</h2>
</center><hr/>
Because of their early prominence in advocating partnerships between
universities and schools in order to strengthen teaching and learning in
schools, Fred M. Hechinger and Ernest L. Boyer were invited  in 1984 by
Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti to become members of the National
Advisory Committee for the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.  From that
time until their deaths last year, they assisted and brought wide
attention to the Institute.  They were personal friends.  When Ernest
Boyer delivered a eulogy at the memorial service for Fred Hechinger, he
said:
<blockquote>
More than any other journalist of our generation, Fred shaped the national
education debate and helped all of us understand that it's in the
classrooms of the nation where the battle for the future of America will
be won or lost....Our challenge, Fred urgently reminded us, is to affirm
the nation's schools and to continue the struggle to achieve excellence
for all children, not just the most advantaged.
</blockquote>
As early as 1981, Fred Hechinger wrote about the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute in his <i>New York Times</i>  column, "About Education": 
<blockquote>
To critics who charge that higher education neglects the elementary and
high schools, Mr. Giamatti replies by pointing to the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute, expanded at his urging in 1978.  It brings together
university professors and local teachers as colleagues to study and
improve the schools.  While not on a level with the late Mr. Conant's
nationwide school reform efforts, Mr. Giamatti feels that universities
today can make their most useful contribution "to where we live." 
</blockquote>
Giamatti had, Hechinger wrote, "urged Education Secretary T. H. Bell to
use those severely limited Federal funds to encourage local cooperation
between colleges and schools because education is a continuous seamless
web, or ought to be.'"
<p>
The next year, Yale, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching, and the Chief State School Officers planned a conference of the
Chiefs and college and university presidents from all the states to
address the role that higher education can and must play in strengthening
teaching in public schools.  In his column, Fred Hechinger wrote, "This
signals the revrsal of a twenty-year breach between higher education and
the schools."  After the conference, he wrote that the "inspiring
examples" of programs like the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute which
were featured as case studies at the conference indicated that "the
college-school connection many experts consider crucial to school reform
is turning into a movement."  He added:
</p><blockquote>
An appeal by top university presidents is crucial.  Most of the current
university-initiated school improvement efforts emanate from only one
sector of those institutions:  their schools of education.  This is not to
belittle the schools of education, but their involvement with the public
schools is part of their normal mission.  If the universities are to have
any impact on high school teachers who feel cut off from their academic
disciplines, then professors from all academic departments must become
involved.
</blockquote>
Throughout the period from 1959, when he was hired as Education Editor of
<i>The New York Times</i> , through 1990 when he retired from <i>The
Times</i>, he often wrote, as he titled a 1986 column, that "To Unlock
School Reform, Teachers are the Key."  That year, commenting on the
Institute's second national conference on "Strengthening Teaching through
Collaboration," he said: "Largely unnoticed by the public, a new movement
of collaboration between high school teachers and college professors has
begun to stretch across the country subverting' the traditional separation
between school and college."  He added, "Yale was the host of the
conference because the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, established in
1978, is one of the oldest and most successful of such collaborative
programs."  As he was retiring from <i>The Times,</i> in his penultimate
column he wrote:  "When the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund recently
gave $2 million [as an endowment challenge grant] to the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute, the relationship between colleges and local public
schools entered a new era.  This major underwriting of one of the earliest
university-school compacts is expected to have a great impact in
furthering such cooperation."  During his illness late last year, it was
gratifying to be able to tell him that the University had successfully
completed that challenge. 
<p>
It was our great good fortune that, on retiring from <i>The Times</i>  and
becoming Senior Advisor to the Carnegie Corporation of New York,  Fred
Hechinger agreed to continue to write a column that he entitled "About
Partnership," which appeared in the first four numbers of <i>On Common
Ground</i>.  For Number 3, published in the fall of 1994, he wrote about
the recent meeting of the National Advisory Committee of the Institute
that he had attended:
</p><blockquote>What the Yale experience and the deliberations of the National
Advisory Committee make clear is that university-school partnership cannot
work unless it is taken seriously as a permanent academic enterprise, not
as a minor dabbling in doing good works at the fringes....With these vital
conditions now firmly in place, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is
ready to serve as a model for other universities in other cities, and the
many teachers waiting to be admitted to a truly professional partnership.
