A Principal's Voice in School/University Partnerships</h2>
<font size="+1">By Charles S. Serns</font>
</center><hr/>
The role of the principal is one fraught with ambiguity. The notion  that
the principal is the instructional leader of the school as well as  the
business manager, public relations expert, compliance officer,  mediator
and good person to all is a myth. The complexity of a  contemporary public
school finds principals in ever changing roles  that are subject to the
whims of school boards, legislatures, and  powerful special interest
groups whose agendas have little to do with  teaching and learning. Given
this state of affairs, what options are  open to principals to allow them
to focus on children and their need  to make meaning of the world around
them? Partnerships can prove  to be part of the answer.
<p>
Principals who are able to make a variety of connections with the
community as a whole are able to get out of some of the systemic  mire and
into constructive areas that meet the needs of children  served by the
school. Powerful partnerships between parents,  community members and
business offer opportunities and  advantages. The principal, through a
shift from system maintenance  to learning facilitator, begins to manage
the learning climate and  professional environment of the school. One
particular partnership  that can greatly improve the instructional climate
is the partnership  between the university and the school.
</p><p>
Three of its advantages are an enhanced sense of a learning  community,
teacher empowerment and expanded leadership roles.  Each allows the
principal to move into leadership realms which are  more powerful, more
productive and significantly impact the  teaching and learning process.
</p><p>
The establishment of a learning community is a multifaceted task. It  is
both a philosophical stance and an organizational necessity. The  learners
in the community are expansive and inclusive. Making  meaning is more
apropos than finding truth. This task can only be  done with reflection
and a willingness to be introspective on both a  personal and
organizational level. The partnership process allows for  this format
because it allows educators to examine the whats, hows  and whys of daily
practice. The collaborative efforts of school people  and university
people allow for a strong research base to be adopted  to the practical
setting so that children's learning is the result of  carefully thought
out and skillfully delivered activities. The meld of  theory, practice,
and delivery has the potential to improve learning  and learners...both
young and old.
</p><p>
Teachers are the professionals who face children on a day to day  basis.
The teacher is the person who is accountable not only for  presenting the
items to be learned but also for assessing what is  learned and how it is
applied. To assure that this process happens,  professional development is
a necessity. It is the means to analyze  the best practice. Since this
analysis is incomplete in isolation,  partnerships offer educators a means
to assess and improve practice  by assessing and improving professional
response. The knowledge  gained in this process empowers educators by
expanding the  significance of choices, responses and analysis in regards
to student  learning.
</p><p>
A school that has a learning community and an empowered  community allows
itself to have expanded leadership roles at all  levels for teachers and
for students. This expansion allows principals  the comfort of knowing
that decisions are being made as a result of  greater knowledge and from a
broader range of stakeholders.  Partnership and collaboration are key
forces in establishing leaders.  This agreement frees the principal from
being all things to all people  and from the impossible task of being an
expert in all areas. The  principal can focus the endeavor on the mission
of the school and  facilitate meeting the needs of children. By giving
away some of the  leadership roles and responsibilities, the principal's
role is actually  strengthened. Joining together as partners is more
powerful and  provocative than standing alone.
</p><p>
One of the most productive challenges a site based administrator  faces is
the forging of alliances and partnerships. University  partnerships allow
for increased learning for the partners and for  best practice for
students. It is a process that is renewing and  invigorating and opens
doors to possibilities far more profound than  simply managing a school.
