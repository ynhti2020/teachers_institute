Overcoming Obstacles to Wider Partners</h2>
<font size="+1">By Rev. Edmund G. Ryan</font>
</center><hr/>
In American colleges and universities during the twentieth century
structures have proliferated. Departments have grouped faculty  according
to academic discipline. Separate schools of Education,  Business, and
Applied Science have brought a number of related  disciplines together in
one administrative unit. Faculty and  university senates have been created
to provide means for the  faculty to participate in decision making. Yet
each of these entities, as  they worked for the good of their college or
university, gained more  and more power and authority.
<p>
Schools, departments, and senates frequently see attempts at  innovation
as a threat to their hard earned prerogatives. A proposal  to establish
partnerships between a college or university and  elementary and secondary
schools calls for faculty to spend time  with teachers in local schools.
But how will the Rank and Tenure  Committee of the Senate weigh the time
spent in collaboration with  schools? The faculty member's efforts
certainly constitute "service."  But, unless a series of articles or a
book result from the collaborating,  will the faculty member be exempt
from the publication requirement  of the institution? How will one's
department vote on the person's  application for tenure or promotion given
the same conditions?
</p><p>
Will departments speak up and declare that school, college and  university
partnerships are not included in their purview? The  English Department
believes that literature and textual criticism are  their main concerns.
Isn't the avowed purpose of the Department or  School of Education to deal
with what happens in schools from pre­ kindergarten through the 12th
grade? Why should members of the  English Department deviate from their
mission? Likewise how happy  and comfortable will a School or a Department
of Education be with  an arrangement between the Biochemistry Department
and the  Associate Superintendent of Curriculum for the local school?
Previously the Dean of the School of Education was the liaison with  local
schools.
</p><p>
These obstacles to partnership described above are viewed from the
campuses of higher education institutions. Undoubtedly school  districts
and individual schools have their own stumbling blocks that  must be
removed before they can reach out and clasp hands in  partnership. But
another group should also be heard from. About 45  percent of
18­year­olds use their high school diplomas to enter two  or
four year colleges. A greater number­55 percent­enter the world
of work. Employers must be heard from. Their stake in the national  debate
over educational reform is obvious.
</p><p>
On February 20,1995, the Federal Department of Education released  a study
that showed employers lacked confidence in the ability of  American
schools and colleges to prepare young people for the  workplace. The
survey was prepared by the National Center on the  Educational Quality of
the Work Force at the University of  Pennsylvania. Their researchers
contacted plant managers or site  managers at 3,000 locations in the
United States with more than 20  workers. It included offices, factories,
and construction sites.
</p><p>
This study indicates that schools are not preparing young students  for
participation in the work force. Managers in offices, factories, and
construction sites state that young people lack the skills and
competencies needed for the world of work. The same managers also
explained that many of the old routine jobs have been taken over by
machines. But the new jobs in the 1990s and in the twenty­first
century need higher skills and computer literacy. Young people with  newly
awarded high school diplomas are ill­equipped to fill these  jobs.
</p><p>
In the discussion of college and university partnerships with schools,
employers should be invited to join in these collaborative efforts. The
Pennsylvania study reveals that business and industry have very  definite
ideas on what students should be taught. Employers might  not be experts
in cognitive development, but they certainly know  what skills and
knowledge new workers must have. Their presence  in the partnership will
prompt educators to broaden the discussion  beyond the
teaching­learning process and to include study in what  students
should learn in order to be ready to take a job in America's  new economy.
</p><p>
Thus the partnerships would reach out beyond the world of the  classroom,
beyond the continuum from pre­kindergarten through  high school and
college. They would accept as another partner  persons from the world of
work. That partner would encourage  schools to graduate persons able to
communicate, to socialize and to  use new technology. Schooling and jobs
would interact to the  betterment of both.
</p><p>
How can colleges and universities encourage more faculty members  to
participate in the college­school­employer relationship? One way
to enlist greater support would be to change the criteria for  promotion
and tenure. Let participation in such partnerships be  recognized by the
college or university as meeting requirements for  both service and
scholarship. The service element is evident. But let  participation in
collaborative efforts that shape curriculum, teaching  methods and job
training be considered scholarship. The changes in  the schools certainly
can be recognized as applied research. College­
university­school and business partnerships take up a faculty
member' s time. That time could have been used to do research and  to
publish. If this new approach to defining research were accepted  as
policy in colleges and universities, more faculty would be glad to  join
in collaborating in partnerships to better the content and process  of
schooling.
