Superintendents' and Principals' Forum:Discussion</h2>
</center><hr/>
Thomas Persing and Charles Serns each led the Editorial Board in
discussing the issues they had raised. We bring you only a few  highlights
from what was often a free­wheeling and hard­hitting
discussion:
<p>
PERSING: The superintendent must acknowledge the importance of
collaboration. Quite frankly, many of my colleagues have no idea  beyond
what happens on a day­today basis within their own little  fiefdom,
one of the eighteen or fifteen thousand or so school districts  in the
United States. You must remember that we have outlived, in  my judgment at
least, the importance of local control. In order for a  superintendent to
get beyond the confines of a school district and  start to think or
acknowledge or wonder whether there is a life  beyond that, they've got to
have a board of school directors that in  turn will encourage and maintain
and sustain that. The  superintendent must try to get them to recognize
that it's a source of  academic and intellectual growth. The guy wants
gutsy stuff, we can  give it to him if we start with this.
</p><p>
JULES PROWN: May some superintendents feel that collaboration is a  threat
to their authority?
</p><p>
PERSING: A good point. You know, the problem with so many of my
colleagues is that they don't understand that the best way to get  power
is to try to give it away.
</p><p>
SERNS: The same is true of principals. If you can overcome that, and  see
the collaboration as a form of empowerment, it would be very  healthy.
</p><p>
EDWARD KISAILUS: Is there something like a principals' school or a
superintendents' organization where they can come together and  discuss
the state of public education?
</p><p>
PERSING: There are ways by which it can be done. But there are  some
districts that prohibit people from getting out of their school  district.
</p><p>
MANUEL GÓMEZ: There are some board members in California who  are
publicly attacking the words "collaboration" and "partnership,"  board
members who are indicating that this undermines the  authority that they
legally have as duly­elected trustees of their  school district. They
do not want that authority undermined or  eroded by entering into
arrangements with universities or other  institutions that, in their
perception, might be more powerful and  want to take over.
</p><p>
JAMES VIVIAN: This really points up to me the value of this  discussion
for the upcoming issue, "Educational Organization and  Change." Without
the active engagement of superintendents and  principals, the
collaborative project is not going to have an  organizational influence in
the schools.
</p><p>
JAY ROBINSON: Have there been any articles addressing the issue of
educating boards on the values of collaboration? Ways in which the
superintendents and principals and teachers can involve themselves
indirectly, because by education you can perhaps generate support  for the
idea.
</p><p>
PERSING: My strategy has been to get superintendents to understand  that
it is in their personal interest to get involved, that it is an
opportunity for them to grow. And then they discover that it is not  only
their personal gain, as they start to influence more people, and  they
bring a lot more back to the school district.
</p><p>
JAMES VIVIAN: One of the things our present superintendent  stresses when
he is talking to principals is much in the same vein: it  is not something
extra or added that he is asking people to do; rather  it is a powerful
means of accomplishing what he has already asked  them to do.
</p><p>
ROBINSON: You know, we ran a project called the Superintendents  Study
Group for three years, with external funding. There were 26
superintendents, who wrote the rules for what they wanted to do  and came
to the University of Michigan campus on a Friday  afternoon. After
listening to a speaker, and discussing the talk, they  came together for a
day as an informal network group. The  superintendents quickly saw the
advantages of it.
</p><p>
VIVIAN: Perhaps we could get a phone conference going, structured  around
the topics as Thom has framed them here, so that there was a  conversation
with participants from different areas of the country  about how we might
persuade superintendents that partnerships are  in their own interest, and
in that of the school district.
</p><p>
SERNS: Another issue: I think it is rare that the head of the public
school institutions and the university organization see that they truly
are connected, and I don't know how to foster that connection. The
superintendent that talks to the university is rare; the college
president that seeks out the superintendent on issues of teaching and
learning is even a rarer bird. I have always found it amazing that  your
president would speak so favorably about the Institute. I doubt  if our
university president knows that there are collaboratives.
</p><p>
KISAILUS: I should think universities would want to be involved  with the
local school districts, especially if they are drawing students  from
those districts. But it just doesn't seem to happen.
</p><p>
GÓMEZ: I think this is happening more and more. I am surprised that
this concept of partnership continues to grow in power, and  continues to
get the support of more and more powerful individuals  in higher
education. I think this trend is related to the continuing  attacks upon
education. As a case in point, the president of the  University of
California, President Atkinson, just convened a major  high­level
task force on the concept of collaboration and outreach,  with chancellors
and regents. It began as a direct outgrowth of the  regents' resolutions
regarding UC admissions, but nonetheless, they  are speaking with business
leaders, CEOs, and others to try to figure  out how to connect more
effectively to public schools.
</p><p>
SERNS: We should recognize that principals are as isolated, at least at
the elementary level, as the superintendent or the president of a
college. The system doesn't see it as important for principals to get
together and talk with one another. The mechanics of partnering are
complex and often the principal is not even in the loop.
</p><p>
THOMAS WHITAKER: How can a principal, in contrast to a  superintendent,
take initiatives in facilitating partnerships?
</p><p>
SERNS: I have tried very hard with our staff to use partnership
activities, which are limited in our district to be part of the
evaluation process and to do that in a way that hopefully breaks  down the
isolation of a teacher in a classroom and recognizes that  expertise
shared is stronger than expertise isolated. I've encouraged  teachers to
accept student­teacher roles, becoming part of the  university' s
writing institute, and having that be part of their  evaluation. The
evaluative process every year is a natural way of  going into that. But of
course, when the possibilities of a particular  university/school
collaboration are limited, I am limited. There are  occasions when we can
talk to teachers to try to have the university  come together with the
schools. But the isolation of a teacher makes  it their first job to teach
children; collaboration is not high on their  list of things they want to
take on and champion.
</p><p>
VIVIAN: A rather different kind of question occurs to me with  respect to
principals and superintendents that I would put under the  heading of "the
helping hand strikes again." Are there universities  and corporations that
come to you seeking some role in your school,  and that may not be at all
on your agenda, but there may be some  political necessity to be welcoming
to that organization? Are there  ways to turn those initiatives from
outside groups to your advantage  so that they are more responsive to the
needs you identify through  the school?
</p><p>
SERNS: I see it as a question of prepositions and the question is: Is it
"done to" or "done with"? The partnerships I've been involved with  have
been "done with," and there is a tremendous amount of  strength in doing
it with one another. The material is gone back to,  the articles are
re­read and re­thought about, the units developed  are reused
and refined, whereas the kind of canned stuff that a lot of  companies
come up with, about how to teach kids better, that gets  lost pretty quick
at least that's been my experience. But I think  corporations now are much
more willing to say, "Well, we don't have  the answer either, but we're
willing to work with you to find the  answer," and I think that's a more
positive environment.
</p><p>
PERSING: In closing, Jim, may I say one thing about how you get it  done.
One of the techniques that I have used is to have the president  of the
university or college come and address the board at a public  meeting for
five minutes, on record before a live audience, to tell the  public and
the board of school directors the importance of  collaboration. Every time
I was able to do that, the collaboration was  successful.
