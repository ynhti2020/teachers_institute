Voices from the Classroom A Case for Collaboration</h2>

For collaboration to occur between a school system and a university
requires more than proximity. It requires a mind­set that we are all
learners in the teaching process.
<p>
Here is one example: During a weekly seminar between mentor  teachers and
university supervisors, a discussion of the need for
multi­culturalism to be an integral part of the school curriculum
creates an awareness among the group that each mentor and  supervisor has
a different idea on what it means to translate the  theory of this
curriculum into practice. One mentor says, "It really  seems that we've
been doing multi­culturalism as a pull out program,  something that
is separate from everything we do." Another mentor  responds, "We need to
broaden this area to consider not only cultural  biases, but gender
biases, and any biases that make us think that  those who are different
from us are inferior." A supervisor feels the  need to narrow the focus to
anti­racism. The question among all  participants arises, "If we
raise the level of our studies in school to  social activism, are we
engaging students appropriately or are we  using our classrooms to serve
our own agendas?"
</p><p>
It becomes obvious that in addition to realizing their different
perspectives, the mentors and university supervisors are into a level  of
discussion on the topic that has become uncomfortable That  discomfort
becomes the focus of the conversation and there is  agreement among the
group that they all have a common desire to  face the discomfort and learn
from each other as they work to  develop an appropriate curriculum for
their apprentices. During  evening seminar for apprentices, mentors, and
university staff, the  discussion continues as participants relate their
ideas to daily  classroom experiences and readings.
</p><p>
Here is another example: Beth, an apprentice teacher, visits the
classroom of a mentor teacher. While visiting, Beth observes the  mentor
lead students through a series of questions and computations  to determine
how far light travels in a light­year. While the mentor  is
facilitating the children's work, Beth asks, "How did scientists
determine the speed of light in the first place?" The mentor pauses,
realizing that she'd never considered that question with her students.
Rather than leave it at that, however, the mentor says for all to hear,
"Oh gosh, what a good question. I don't know the answer." The  mentor
helps Beth find the reference books and says, "Let's look in  here. Why
don't you see if you can make sense of the information at  the end of the
lesson today." At the end of the lesson, Beth shares  with the class the
book she read to find the answer to the question.
</p><p>
With that one brief interaction, the mentor has modeled for her  students
and for the apprentice a willingness to be a non­expert in  the
class. Learning is seen as a continuing process. The mentor has  modeled
how to find information in the class and has integrated the  apprentice in
an authentic way into the lesson. The mentor has  validated that Beth has
the ability to share what she knows with  elementary students as their
teacher. A pattern has been set for the  collaboration that will occur
when Beth begins her work as a full  time apprentice.
</p><p>
Isolated incidents? No. Each of these scenarios took place during one
week within the context of the Career Development Program, a
collaborative program of the University of New Mexico and  Albuquerque
Public Schools. This seventeen­month program,  designed to prepare
individuals making a career change for teaching  certification, involves
the collaboration of university personnel,  public school employees
released from classroom duties to serve as  university instructors, master
teachers in the classroom who mentor  program participants, public school
students from kindergarten to  fifth grade, and people from all walks of
life who have decided to  pursue teaching as a career. The program
represents collaboration on  many levels as participants come together in
different configurations  to read, present, experience, discuss, practice,
and reflect.
</p><p>
As participants in the program, we have been able to experience this
multi­dimensional collaboration and understand the growth that is
possible from the experience. The prerequisites for effective
collaboration include a mutual respect among the participants for one
another's knowledge, perspective and experiences, and an openness  to what
another has to offer. Also needed is a tentativeness about  one's own
ideas, an attitude that is always open for reconsideration.  Thus the
mentor teachers in the discussion group were able to  explore
multi­culturalism from many different angles, not always  pleasant
ones. Trust and community are necessary ingredients, as  well as
willingness to be open to learning from whatever source, as  was evident
in Beth's entry into the lesson.
</p><p>
It is through community created by trust, openness, respect, and
reflection that collaboration produces growth. The individual teacher  in
the classroom is isolated. That teacher may reflect and learn from
experience and from reading. He or she may seek growth, but the  human
tendency is to seek experiences which reinforce preconceived  ideas or
stances. Within a community of learners the learner is  forced to confront
ideas that do not necessarily match his or her own.  This promotes
reflection and rethinking, which may lead to new  ideas or to
re­affirmation of old ideas but from a greater depth of
understanding and insight. Further, the collaborative community  provides
support that encourages the learner to risk, to try new  ideas, to move
out on a limb. Growth cannot occur without some risk,  and a collaborative
community provides the environment in which it  can occur.
