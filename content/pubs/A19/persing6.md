Partnerships and the Role of the Superintendent</h2>
<font size="+1">by Thomas E. Persing</font>
</center><hr/>
This is an open invitation to all superintendents of public school
systems to rise up and seize the high ground by exercising your
leadership. The superintendent's leadership is the vital ingredient for
initiating, nurturing and sustaining a partnership program. This is  not
to say that others within the school district do not play vital and
important roles. Notwithstanding, it is the superintendent who  possesses
the power to make or break a university/school district  partnership.
<p>
In the current embattled arena of public education, it is  commonplace to
brand the superintendent as the culprit for <i>high</i>  taxes and
<i>poor</i> performance of the students under his or her charge.
Therefore, one might ask why should another task be assumed by an
obviously overworked individual. That is a fair and reasonable  question
which deserves an equally fair and reasonable answer.
</p><p>
Having been in education over forty years, and as a superintendent  about
thirty of those years, please allow me to share some personal  experiences
and observations. First, a university or college  partnership will help
you escape from the trap of day足to足day,  operational, mundane,
mediocre and mind numbing chores that  demand your attention and time, yet
destroy your intellectual  growth. That is, a partnership with a
university will present an  opportunity for you to engage and interact
with academic scholars.  This will give you time to explore ideas which
will reinvigorate your  professional life. Secondly, a university
partnership will give the  Board of School Directors, the professional and
support staff, the  media, and community a chance to view you as a leader
who gives  importance to what we are all about, i.e., academics, learning,
curriculum, and children. Thirdly, partnerships will enable you to
network with a newly found national group of other professionals  who will
present to you many new opportunities for personal and  professional
growth.
</p><p>
Here are some of the ways to get started: 
</p><ul><li>Investigate how the Yale University足New Haven Teachers
Institute  was founded and continues to be successful. 
</li><li>Visit with a local university or college president and discuss the
importance of a partnership and need for collaboration. Formulate a  plan
in cooperation with the board president. Have the  college/university
president present the proposal for a partnership  to the board at a public
meeting or at least send a formal letter of  invitation to create a
partnership.
</li></ul>
Partnerships can take many forms: 
<ul>
<li>A professor with 8足12 teachers constructing new curriculum or
improving the old curriculum in math, science, history, humanities,  etc. 
</li><li>The superintendent or others teaching at the university. 
</li><li>Inviting a professor to teach at one of the district schools.
</li></ul>
Having had the experience of starting a school partnership with the
Lehigh Valley Consortium of Colleges in Allentown, Pennsylvania, I  would
be happy to help, in my way, to get your school district  started with a
college/university partnership. Please call.
<p>
Lastly, superintendents have the moral and ethical responsibility to
<i>push the envelope</i> when promoting a positive image of public
education. We must become more aggressive and bold in these types  of
endeavors, if superintendents are to be the recognized educational  leader
and truly a Chief Executive Officer of a learning organization.  Stop
thinking and <b>Just do it!</b>
