School­College Partnerships:  Lessons of the Past</h2>
<font size="+1">By Arthur Levine</font>
</center><hr/>
School­college partnerships are in vogue today. They are being
touted by government, foundations, national commissions, the press,  and
educators of all stripes. And despite all the hoopla, they actually  seem
to be a pretty good idea.
<p>
In fact, they are such a good idea that every few decades we as a  nation,
resurrect the notion of building a bridge between grades 12  and 13.
Historical memory being what it is, there has been a  tendency to view
each resurrection as a birth rather than a rebirth  or as an innovation
rather than a renovation. This essay is a quick  look backward at the
first attempt at school­college partnership,  which may have been the
most successful cooperative foray. It was  certainly the longest in
duration, lasting from roughly 1810 to World  War I.
</p><p>
Much about this first partnership is reminiscent of contemporary
initiatives. Then, as now, schools and colleges were under public  attack.
They were said to be the root of most national problems,  ranging across
the economic and social fabric of the country from the  moral decay of the
nation and the worsening conditions of our older  industries to the
decline of civic engagement and the coddling of  immigrants. The schools
themselves were criticized for poor quality  and diminishing standards.
The curriculum was characterized as  being anachronistic and incoherent,
and including too much remedial  education.
</p><p>
The leaders in the current partnership efforts were the leaders in the
first era, too. They included the chief federal education officer, the
heads of a few prominent schools and colleges, an assortment of
journalists, and a few of the better­known foundation presidents.
</p><p>
Then, as now, there was an outpouring of reports and task forces,  and one
inescapable fact about school­college partnerships is that  they have
never been a friend to trees. The recommendations of the  reports have not
changed much over the years either. They initially  proposed higher
academic standards, more rigorous curricula, a  longer school year, better
quality teachers, stronger student  discipline and, of course, more
school­college cooperation.
</p><p>
So much for <i>deja vu.</i> This is where the historical mirror ends. In
two  critical respects the first movement differed sharply from the
current version. One difference is the nature of philanthropy. In the
first era of cooperation, there were far fewer funders.
</p><p>
Their resources were larger, their goals were more focused, and
substantial incentives were offered to schools and colleges for  achieving
specific goals. For example, perhaps the most influential  force for
bringing about planned change across secondary and higher  education early
in the century was the Carnegie Foundation for the  Advancement of
Teaching. It had sufficient revenues to offer a  pension to the faculties
of colleges that met its goals, which among  other things, required, for
admission, a four­year high school  education, including 14 units of
study, which consisted of four major  classes taken five times a week. In
demanding these changes, the  Carnegie Foundation simultaneously changed
the nature of collegiate  and secondary education in the United States.
</p><p>
The point is not whether the Carnegie­induced reforms were good or
bad but simply that the place of resources in school­college
partnerships has changed. Today, philanthropic support is more  diffuse
and less effective. The number of foundations involved has  expanded
geometrically over the years. The size of their resources  has shrunk in
equal proportion. The result, in the main, is a  cornucopia of underfunded
and ephemeral initiatives, sponsored by  lone foundations, which lack both
the focus and the leverage to  support substantial, long­term
partnership activities.
</p><p>
The second difference between the two eras is that the first created
permanent mechanisms to support the partnerships. Accreditation is  an
example. In 1885, the New England Association of Schools and  Colleges was
created to bring together the secondary and higher  education communities.
The idea caught on, and regional associations  were created across the
country. In 1901, one of them, the North  Central Association, set
standards for high school recognition or  accreditation that included an
annual calendar of 35 weeks of  instructions, four to five major periods a
day, and instruction in  specified subject areas. The standards were
widely adopted by the  other associations, and by 1903 the regionals were
not only  accrediting schools, but also colleges.
</p><p>
Another example is the common college admission test. Created in  1901 by
a newly established organization named the College Board,  this exam was
designed to replace the individual tests of the more  than 400 colleges
and universities in the country. In this sense the  test became a vehicle
for establishing common subject expectations  for both college admission
and high school graduation.
</p><p>
In contrast, the current partnership movement has not tended to  produce
"permanent" structures of this sort. Rather, the relationships  between
schools and colleges have been looser, more local, and more  diverse in
nature. Few offer much promise of surviving the current  movement.
</p><p>
After more than a century of intermittently supported revivals of  school
and college partnerships, we have learned a few things.  Maybe the most
important is that cooperation is faddish. Historically,  periods of high
school­college partnership have been short. They  have lasted only as
long as public pressure persisted and colleges  and schools could solve
their problems better together than apart.
</p><p>
I have no illusions that the current effort will bridge the gap  between
grades 12 and 13, but I do believe we can make real  progress in reducing
the gap. We do not have a lot of time left to do  this. If we are to make
the most of it, I think we need to learn the  lessons of the first reform
period and engage in three activities:
</p><ul>
<li>overcome the miasma of recommendations and develop a shorter  and more
clearly defined agenda for cooperative action;
</li><li>use existing mechanisms or create new arrangements which will  carry
out that agenda, even after the enthusiasm of the moment has  passed; and
</li><li>target philanthropic dollars specifically at the short, cooperative
agenda and give those revenues leverage and longevity.
