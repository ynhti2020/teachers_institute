Superintendents' and Principals' Forum: Introduction</h2>
</center><hr/>
The Editorial Board has felt for some time that <i>On Common Ground</i>
needed an ampler expression of the viewpoints of superintendents  and
principals. Any partnership between universities and schools, if  it is to
succeed, must have their enthusiastic support. And not only  are
superintendents and principals, like administrators of other  educational
units, besieged by a multitude of immediate problems  pressed upon them by
their constituencies and by higher authorities,  but they are also
remarkably isolated from those who have  comparable positions in other
districts or schools. It would be  helpful, surely, for superintendents
and principals to have some easy  means of communication with each other
and with the wider circle  of those who may share their concerns.
<p>
Hence the idea of this Forum. We began, during the Editorial Board
meeting in Santa Fe this past February, with presentations by  Thomas E.
Persing, who has had many years of experience as a school  superintendent,
and Charles S. Serns, who has also had a good many  years of experience as
a principal. What followed was a vigorous  discussion in which the Board
learned a good deal about the specific  problems that such administrators
confront and the opportunities  that they may nonetheless or therefore
find for embarking upon  collaborative projects.
</p><p>
As our first Forum, therefore, we give you the position papers that
Persing and Serns presented to us at Santa Fe, along with excerpts  from
the discussion that followed.
</p><p>
This Forum, we hope, will encourage superintendents and principals  to
imagine what might be accomplished in their own districts and  schools. As
one answer, we include a piece by Foster B. Gibbs of  Saginaw, Michigan,
which offers ample testimony of the ability of a  superintendent and a
school system to work together with people  from universities to improve
education for our children. We invite  other superintendents and
principals to send to <i>On Common Ground </i> their contributions for
this continuing Forum.
