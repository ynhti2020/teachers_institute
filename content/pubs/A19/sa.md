Do Better Teachers Equal Better Schools</h2>
<font size="+1">By Sophie Sa</font>
</center><hr/>
The instinctive answer to that question is: yes, of course! Certainly, it
is impossible to have good schools without good teachers. And with  so
many of our schools in trouble, and no way of getting a significant
number of new and more qualified teachers into classrooms, there  has been
a sense of urgency on the part of everyone interested in  improving our
schools to invest in quality professional development  for those already
in the teaching force.
<p>
However, a good school needs not only good teachers. Indeed, I  would be
prepared to argue that a school made up entirely of  individual good
teachers might still be no more than mediocre. The  reason is that a
school, like almost everything else. must be more  than the sum of its
separate parts. Imagine a watch whose various  mechanisms are made by
different craftsmen working separately  without a design. Or a house built
by a skilled electrician, plumber,  and carpenter who have not seen the
master plan. No matter how  well constructed each individual component may
be, the result can  only be an incoherent jumble.
</p><p>
To be good, a school of course needs a knowledgeable staff that is
informed about and able to implement the best practices in their
classrooms. But, perhaps more importantly, it needs to be guided by  a
shared vision and sense of mission. It needs an organizing principle  that
places children's learning needs at the center of every activity,  within
a culture that values learning and insists on thoughtfulness,
reflectiveness, self­assessment, and self­examination. And it
needs a  staff that interacts regularly and frequently, collaborates to
make  decisions about all aspects of the school based on sound
professional  judgment, and takes individual and collective responsibility
for the  success of its students.
</p><p>
Most schools have never been asked to have a vision or a guiding
principle. And rather than being encouraged to reflect, use  professional
judgment, and be creative; what has been demanded of  schools is that they
adhere strictly to district and state requirements  about what to teach,
how to teach, how long to teach, what textbooks  to use, and so on usually
just like every other school of the same  level in the district, and
possibly in the whole state. Additionally, the  way that schools are
usually structured allows almost no time for  teachers to interact, much
less collaborate.
</p><p>
We know now that the cookie­cutter approach to education does not
work: students are not all alike, and schools must be organized  uniquely
to serve the needs of their particular students. We have  also learned,
over the past decade or so, that top­down reform  doesn't work,
precisely because it encourages the kind of unthinking  compliance that
has gotten our schools into such trouble in the first  place. At the same
time, we are also finding how difficult bottom­up  reform is: many,
if not most, teachers do not know the new content  that they are now
required to teach; do not have the skills to teach  the new content; and
do not have the pedagogical knowledge to help  their students reach the
new performance standards being called for.
</p><p>
Because of all of this, there is a recognition that quality professional
development for teachers is critical, and not as an add­on to their
regular duties but as an integral part of their work. However, most
professional development programs continue to be focused on  individual
teachers, with no thought as to the overall needs of the  school as a
whole, as if individual teachers and their individual  classrooms, rather
than the school as a whole, are the units of change.
</p><p>
If we attend to only what happens in individual classrooms, then at  the
very least, we run the risk of losing students between the classes.  If
good schools are what we want, then professional development  must be
integrated into the overall improvement plans for the  school.
</p><p>
It is time for professional development providers to rethink how  they do
their business. Rather than offering workshops and courses  that teachers
may attend solely on the basis of their individual  interests, consider
requiring participation by school teams, and then  only if they come with
a plan from their school clearly indicating  how the workshops fit into
its overall improvement plan.
</p><p>
Better yet, consider working with a whole school to help it through  the
steps of first developing a vision and then designing a plan of  action,
including the range of professional development activities  that will be
needed; provide the staff development; and finally,  provide ongoing
technical assistance as the school moves through the  arduous and complex
process of change.
</p><p>
"Authentic assessment" and "accountability" have become the new  buzzwords
of education. In fact, there is still very little of either  taking place
anywhere in schools, in districts, in staff development  providers, and in
funders of staff development. Schools need to begin  to evaluate
themselves and hold themselves accountable for  providing the vision and
environment within which teachers can  collaboratively design and
implement the best learning programs for  the students. Districts must
evaluate and hold themselves  accountable for whether their programs
result in the improvement of  whole schools.
</p><p>
While it is no longer politically correct to blame teachers for the slow,
some would say, imperceptible, pace of reform, there is nevertheless  a
lingering suspicion that perhaps the people in our teaching force  simply
do not have the capacity to improve. It is time for us,  providers and
funders of staff development alike, to ask whether it  isn't our programs
that need improvement.
