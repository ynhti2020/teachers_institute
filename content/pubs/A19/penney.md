In This Challenge There is Real Opportunity</h2>

In the years ahead, K­12, as it is commonly called, will have more
and more in common with post­secondary institutions. Both already
feel and will continue to feel the effects of change. Both will  therefore
need to undertake more truly collaborative efforts than  ever before.
<p>
For several reasons the rate of change over the next 5­10 years is
bound to accelerate:</p><p>
1) Taxpayers appear less and less willing to pay the cost of  education,
or to continue a commitment to financial aid for students  at the
post­secondary level.</p><p>
2) New technology is changing the ways in which we teach and  students
learn. It will become an ever more useful and necessary  tool in student
learning. </p><p>
3) The population has already changed radically­into a rainbow of
White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian faces. Data from our own city and
campus reflect this. In 1990, African­Americans comprised 24  percent
of its population; Latinos, 10.4 percent; and Asians, about 5.3  percent.
Haitian and Southeast Asian communities have developed in  the
neighborhoods of Dorchester, Roxbury, Mattapan, Jamaica Plain  and
Brighton. The total minority enrollment at UMass Boston has  increased in
the last six years from approximately 17 percent to 27.5  percent, almost
one third of our student body. In Fall, 1993, minority  students comprised
43.8 percent of all new freshmen and 25.2  percent of new transfers. </p><p>
4) Education in schools and universities will be less bound to the
traditional academic calendars and more global in its focus. </p><p>
5) Both sectors then will see greater emphasis upon learning than  upon
teaching. There will be less lecturing and more collaboration  and
cooperative learning. More internships will be created, and there  will be
more focus on the transition from school to career. There will  be a
greater need at both levels to develop leaders.
</p><p>
Because of changes in our society, the importance of education will  be
heightened at the same time that the taxpayer seems more  unwilling to
shoulder its costs. If K­12 and post­secondary education  are to
meet these challenges, they must find more and better ways to  collaborate
and to cooperate. That is, to me, the solution, the  opportunity within
the challenge.
</p><p>
Most institutions of higher education, of course, can already provide  an
impressive list of programs and services they offer to local  schools.
Since the late 1950s, there has been a dramatic increase in  the number of
university­sponsored programs for  elementary/secondary students and
teachers. Major funding from  the U. S. Office of Education, the National
Science Foundation, and  major private foundations such as Ford, Kellogg,
and Pew, has  provided generous support for these programs. The question
we  must now answer is, have we made a difference for the children in
those programs? We will be called to do greater reporting and  develop
accountability measures. The quest for more accountability  provides us a
much­needed opportunity to re­examine the  assumptions and
methods that have shaped the programs. We can  now build on the lessons of
the many programs and experiments that  have made a measurable and
significant difference, and phase out  activities that no longer have a
clear purpose and a successful  conclusion.
</p><p>
The challenge is to create a coherent and well­coordinated  framework
that engages teachers and university faculty, and schools  and
institutions of higher education in a shared vision about how  they
together can address the educational needs of all the nation's  children
and young people. At the heart of this work must be a set of  new
understandings about schools and about the role of universities  in that
relationship. As I reflect on my own experiences in higher  education and
in school­college collaboration, I find some important  lessons which
can guide us in the future.
</p><p>
During my years as Associate Provost at Yale, 1976­1982, I worked
closely with the Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute. It was an
excellent example of collaboration between university faculty and  New
Haven teachers. Clearly, the seminars were exciting to both, the
evaluations were more than positive, and the effect on the teachers
themselves and the curriculum was profound. The Yale faculty were  engaged
with teachers in positive ways. Another example at Yale is  Dr. James
Comer's project, which also shows the impact a major  university and its
faculty can have on a city and its schools.
</p><p>
At the SUNY system, as Vice Chancellor for Academic Programs,  Policy, and
Planning for a 64 campus system of 380,000 students, I  coordinated the
work of a Chancellor's Task Force on Teacher  Education and was involved
regularly with the schools of education,  their deans and their faculties.
Like Yale, the SUNY campuses were  each involved in their cities and
communities in substantial ways,  working with teachers and schools.
</p><p>
After coming to the University of Massachusetts Boston as Chancellor  in
1988, I began to work with my co­author, who was the Dean of  our
Graduate College of Education. I found a number of exciting  initiatives
undertaken with the Boston Public Schools. As a commuter  campus we serve
many of the same families that use the Boston  Public Schools. Our campus
goal has been to create pathways to  enable children and adults to pursue
their educational dreams as far  as their talents will allow. While many
of our programs were started  to serve specific populations, over the past
five years we have  worked to create a unified network that maximizes our
human and  fiscal resources. Our array of programs­over
30­serves gifted and  talented students as well as those with
learning difficulties. The  approach is to connect youngsters to the
appropriate support  program and then move them to the next level.
</p><p>
One of the early campus initiatives was the Institute for Teaching  and
Learning. This Institute engaged children and teachers in issues  that
concern them in their schools and neighborhoods. Teachers  shared
responsibility for leadership. Successful programs now  include our Urban
Scholars Program, an after­school and summer  program working with
young people in the Boston Schools at the high  school age to introduce
them to the idea of attending college and to  prepare them to do so.
One outstanding success in this program is a young woman from
Dorchester's Jeremiah Burke High School. After completing Urban  Scholars
at UMass Boston, she went on to Wellesley and Brown  University. She has
now returned to UMass Boston as a member of  the faculty in the English
Department. Patricia Powell is the author of  two novels. <i>Me Dying
Trial</i> recalls her childhood in Jamaica; <i>A Small  Gathering of
Bones</i> is a reflection on AIDS. Professor Powell's  development is
clear evidence that the Urban Scholars is a  collaborative program that
works.
</p><p>
A second example is our Guaranteed Admissions Program, with three  Boston
inner­city high schools, to work with 9th graders. We provide
tutoring and support systems to guarantee them admission to UMass  Boston
if they meet the terms of a contract they sign with us in the  9th grade.
We have also raised scholarship funds to assist them on  admission. A
third example is Another Course to College, which  allows high school
students to take courses on the Boston campus.
</p><p>
These are all successful programs, although they are quite different  from
the Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute. We have a similar  program
through our Massachusetts Teachers' Academy. The  Academy convenes
teachers from across the state who represent  elementary, middle and high
schools in urban, suburban and rural  communities to share their insights
into best practices and the  development of new curricula. The academy is
sponsored by the  Massachusetts Field Center for Teaching and Learning,
which is part  of our Graduate College of Education.
In all these programs, we have learned and continue to learn several
lessons:
</p><p>
<b>First,</b> schools must be viewed as places where new knowledge is
created rather than where consumers of information are developed  for
universities. We must find ways to tap into and preserve the rich
experience base of the nation's teachers. We must find ways to  capture
their insights about the teaching/learning process, and  preserve those
that work best for children.
</p><p>
<b>Second,</b> University faculty and school based practitioners must
share  equally the responsibility, the risks and the rewards of working
together on behalf of children. We, too, suffer from the failure of the
schools.
</p><p>
<b>Third,</b> as the school reform and restructuring processes gain
momentum, schools of education and arts and sciences will have to
reconsider their curricula. We must certainly train students in the  new
technologies. Already many schools are ahead of higher  education in their
use of and access to computers. This also means we  must pay increased
attention to the professional development needs  of our faculties.
</p><p>
<b>Fourth,</b> universities need to create both support structures and
philosophical contexts for their school initiatives. Through promoting
collaboration among a campus's different initiatives, a university can
maximize the collective investment, and build a community of  colleagues
that share this interest and involvement with the schools.
</p><p>
<b>Fifth,</b> university reward systems will need to be reordered to give
appropriate recognition to work in schools. Faculty who spend time
working in schools are too often "punished" when they are  considered for
promotion and tenure. The institution may also be  punished even further
if this work is not seen as producing post­ secondary teachers and
administrators. Working in schools on issues  of change is energy
intensive, but it does not immediately produce  information for scholarly
publication. We must find ways to assess  this work over time, so that we
properly consider it in making  professional judgments about faculty
members. We must also find  ways to count this as real work, so that
university participating  faculty­and their institutions­are not
punished in funding decisions.
</p><p>
<b>Sixth,</b> because campuses may support these efforts with their own
operating funds, and because trustees will exert increasing pressure  to
justify allocations of resources, better indicators must be  developed to
help a campus assess the quality of its work and gauge  the benefits of
its investment.
</p><p>
As we move into the future, an important part of my vision will be to
build on these lessons from the past, but also to make working with  the
schools and the "seamless web of education" a goal of the entire
University community. We have recognized at UMass Boston that  working
with the schools is not simply the responsibility of the  Graduate College
of Education. We have efforts in collaboration with  the schools
throughout the University. Our College of Nursing has  provided health and
nutrition information to the schools. The College  of Management has been
in exploratory discussions with school  administrators in areas including
accounting and purchasing. The  University's Athletic Department and its
facilities are creating  alternatives to participation in gangs. These
efforts will become yet  more important in the future.
</p><p>
The future for education will need to be one of true collaboration. A
breaking down of barriers between schools and universities, whether  in
finance or governance, and a promotion of the crossover of  students and
teachers between the two is our challenge. If we can  meet it, and I
believe we must, schools and universities will be one  of the most
important resources to their cities and regions.
