Staff Development and School Improvement</h2>
<font size="+1">By Foster B. Gibbs</font>
</center><hr/>
The relationship between the Saginaw Public Schools and the  University of
Michigan is one that has had a tremendous impact on  teaching and learning
in an urban school district, and can serve as a  road map for school
districts seeking systemic change through  successful staff development
partnerships. Saginaw is beset by the  same urban problems and issues that
affect cities throughout the  county. According to census data, Saginaw is
the seventh poorest city  in the United States, with nearly one in three
of its 70,000 citizens  living below the poverty line. The Saginaw Public
Schools have an  enrollment of 13,500 students, two­thirds of whom
are minority.  Nearly 75 percent of our students qualify for free or
reduced lunch.  Many of our students come to school without desirable
conditions for  learning. Many have little or no hope or vision of their
future. Yet  despite demographics that would suggest otherwise, the
district has  earned a statewide reputation for quality schools,
innovative  programs and financial stability. It hasn't happened by
accident and  we didn't accomplish it alone.
<p>
When I was named Superintendent of Schools in Saginaw in 1978,  public
education was beleaguered. Coleman, Jencks and other  university
researchers were telling us that schools couldn't make a  difference in
the lives of poor children, that socio­economic factors  controlled
their destiny. The situation became magnified in 1983  with the
publication of "A Nation At Risk" and dozens of other studies  eager to
spotlight the so­called "failings of American public  education." For
teachers in districts like Saginaw, the constant  criticism of urban
schools cut deeply.
</p><p>
It took the "effective schools" research of Edmonds, Eurick, Lazotte  and
Brookover and others, to re­focus the nation on the belief that all
children can learn, even those from the most economically  disadvantaged
backgrounds, and that schools can make a difference  if they concentrate
on the variables that lead to academic success. In  Saginaw Schools, the
work of Edmonds and others triggered our first  ten­year plan for
school improvement and we began to seek out staff  development and
training programs to support our work. At the  same time, we were
strengthening our school improvement  infrastructure, which already
included a research, testing and  evaluation capability to enhance our
data based decision making and  a zero base budgeting process that enabled
us to direct our financial  resources to the highest priority needs of the
district.
</p><p>
As we expanded and sharpened the tools of change, we began to see
results. Test scores began to increase. Morale began to improve. Our
dropout rate began to drop dramatically. We began to see that a staff
development program linked to specific school improvement  concepts could
have a positive impact on student achievement and  staff performance. But
we also knew that in order to achieve  fundamental, long­term,
systemic change, it was crucial that our staff  development efforts focus
on not just arming teachers with the latest  theories and techniques but
on empowering them as professionals.  The traditional approach to staff
development could carry us only so  far.
</p><h3> The UM Connection</h3>
In the mid 1980s, we began to design a staff development program  that
would support fundamental organizational change. We set out to  find
individuals who shared our optimism in the future of urban  education and
who had a "break­the­mold" attitude. At the  University of
Michigan' s Center for Educational Improvement  Through Collaboration
(CEIC), we were fortunate to find a group of  university people who were
looking to forge a similar relationship  with public education. Dr. Jay
Robinson and Dr. Patti Stock believed  that staff development was a
two­way street, that public school  teachers and university
professors could learn from <i>each other</i>. What  evolved was a
symbiotic relationship: They had the content  knowledge; we had the
experience of teaching in an urban setting.  The University of Michigan
team presented themselves to our staff  as colleagues, not experts, in the
same way we envisioned our  teachers working with their students.
<p>
Saginaw's association with the University of Michigan began a decade  ago
with a seminar for teachers and administrators, entitled  "Thinking About
Thinking in Michigan," through which staff and UM  professors had the
opportunity to simply discuss issues and share  opinions about a variety
of topics. Out of this seminar grew the idea  of teachers as researchers
who could contribute to their profession in  ways they had not yet
imagined.
</p><p>
The first major partnership between Saginaw Schools and the  University of
Michigan was a high school language arts collaboration  entitled "The
Assessment of Writing Project." While improved  student writing was the
overt focus of this effort, it was apparent  from the beginning that a new
method of staff development, linked  to instructional improvement, was
taking shape in the classrooms. Dr.  Robinson and Dr. Stock were in our
classrooms, teaching and  modeling behavior and learning from our teachers
and students.  They were working with our teachers in the same way we
wanted  our teachers to work with students as colleagues in learning. The
UM team walked the halls of our two high schools, got to know the
students, taught classes alone and in tandem with their teaching
partners, marveled at some students' abilities, agonized over ways to
reach others who struggled academically, and attended staff  meetings and
school events.
</p><p>
The most visible products of this ten­year association are two
anthologies <i>The Bridge</i>, published in 1988, and <i>Footsteps</i>,
published  in 1991 based on the real­life experiences of students in
our two  high schools. The most long­lasting product, however,
continues to be  the rejuvenated and re­focused teachers in our
schools who will  never go back to the traditional methods of teaching.
</p><p>
Not long after the start of the Writing Project, we approached  another
University of Michigan professor, Dr. Bill Stapp of the  Department of
Natural Resources, who had developed an approach to  teaching
environmental science using a similar hands­on, applied,
real­world, team­oriented process. Dr. Stapp also became a part
of  our schools, working with teachers to design and implement a water
quality testing program that would have as its classrooms the  Saginaw
River and its tributaries. Through this project we realized  the
importance of expanding our staff development efforts to include  business
and industry representatives. Teachers, university  instructors and
industry professionals, with General Motors taking  the lead role, began
to change the way we deliver science education  to our elementary, middle
school and high school students, taking  them out of their textbooks and
into a real life situation that included  the quality of the water they
depend on for daily living. Students  from our most economically
disadvantaged neighborhoods, and their  teachers, were working
side­by­side with university instructors and  chemists,
environmental engineers and water quality specialists as  partners in
learning. The Saginaw River Project, which involves  hundreds of students
each year, has become nationally recognized  for its innovative approach
to teaching and learning. More  importantly, our staff has found new ways
of teaching science and  motivating reluctant learners through a
collaborative approach.
</p><h3> What We've Learned</h3>
Through our work with the University of Michigan, and subsequently
Michigan State University and Saginaw Valley State University, we  have
developed a set of guiding principles for staff development.  They include
the following:
<ul><li>
<b>Let the Mission Drive the Process:</b> In Saginaw Schools, professional
development is geared to the district's mission and graduate  standards
that have been developed with the help of our direct  customers  business,
industry and higher education. It is tied to the  district's school
improvement goals and to each school's annual  educational plan.
</li><li><b> Listen to Those Closest to the Situation: </b>More and more, we
are  attempting to link staff development with the needs of individual
schools and the classroom teacher. Teachers play a major role in  charting
its direction. Those closest to the level at which teaching and  learning
occur have the best knowledge of what they need based  upon what works,
and what's not quite perfect yet.
</li><li><b>Make Long­term Commitments:</b> From our experience,
professional  development must be a planned, lifelong process of
continuous  learning that is best received when it occurs as a natural
outgrowth  of one's work.
</li><li><b>Develop a Symbiotic Relationship: </b>Experience has taught us that
the  most effective staff training programs occur when there is a
partnership in which benefit accrues to all stakeholders.
</li><li><b>Select Your Partners Carefully:</b> In addition to being caring,
sensitive, empathetic and mission­driven, the partner must
philosophically believe in organizational development through  human
development.
</li><li><b>Be Consistent: </b>Don't drop and add new programs and approaches
every year. Educators are wary of change, and if you aren't  consistent
over time, many will be rightly skeptical and simply wait  out the latest
trend. Long­term commitment to a long­term vision is  critical.
</li><li><b>Address Fundamental Beliefs First:</b> A change in human behavior
occurs only when preceded by a change in the fundamental belief  structure
of the individual. Organizational change is preceded by a  shift in the
culture of the group. Do I really believe that all children  can learn? Do
I believe in teamwork? What does empowerment  mean to me? Can I teach
without a textbook? Can I feel comfortable  taking risks and occasionally
failing? Only when these fundamental  questions are answered, through the
experiences of the teachers, can  a climate of change exist in a school.
</li><li><b>Trust One Another and Yourself: </b>The real experts exist in the
classrooms of every school system. A successful staff development  program
will create opportunities for staff to discover, discuss and  share what
works and why. If we want our students to be self­ actualized, we
must select and build self­actualized teachers and role  models.
</li><li><b>Involve the Students: </b>Staff development that fails to include
students as active participants in the process is not likely to achieve
the desired results. Students must be viewed as colleagues and not
passive learners.
</li><li><b>Make Training Relevant:</b>Does it fit the mission? Will it help
teachers in the classroom? Is it consistent with our beliefs? Does it
address content areas? Our partnerships demonstrated to us that  students
learn best when they are engaged in work that affects them  directly, that
has meaning in their lives and draws on their  experiences. Professionals
are no different.
</li><li><b>Institutionalize It:</b> In 1986, we opened the Instructional and
Staff  Development Center in Saginaw Schools to meet our expanded
training needs. Located in a former elementary school, the facility
served as a focal point for our staff development and instructional
improvement efforts. While you don't need a new facility to  underscore
the importance of staff development, a district does need  to make it an
important, on­going part of its operation.
</li></ul>
<h3> Problems to Overcome</h3>
The first problem we had to address was at titudinal. There was a natural
skepticism on the part of staff that this  was simply another new program
brought to the district by someone  with something to sell. The skepticism
began to fade when staff  discovered that this partnership with the
University of Michigan was  different and that it had utility for them as
classroom teachers. They  found out that these university people were not
going to hand them  a program and leave but that they were going to be in
the classrooms  with them, working side­by­side.
<p>
A second problem, and one we continue to wrestle with, is making  time for
training. The current school day structure makes it difficult  to provide
the training that is needed. We need an eight­hour, on­ site
workday without expanded caseloads, in order to accomplish the  types of
professional development that are required. Until that is  achieved, we
need to find creative ways to incorporate training  programs during the
school day without continually pulling teachers  out of their classrooms.
Until an eight­hour workday becomes a  reality, we will be forced to
create whatever training opportunities  we can for staff, during school,
after school and during the summer.
</p><h3> The Future</h3>
This new approach to staff development has evolved over the past  decade
to encompass many areas of the school district. Dr. Stock, who  later
joined the staff of Michigan State University as head of the  Writing
Center, continued to be involved in our district through the  "Write For
Your Life" project, through which students and teachers  together explore
experience­based writing that focuses on health  issues. A number of
our teachers have been involved for the past  three years in the National
Writing Project through Saginaw Valley  State University. We have since
developed several tri­partnerships  with business/industry and higher
education that bring diverse  human resources into our schools to work
directly with teachers and  students on an ongoing basis. More and more of
our staff renewal  efforts are targeted to meet the needs of individual
school  improvement plans and classroom teachers. Teachers play a major
role in designing these activities. Such professional development  changes
lives and empowers teachers and students. Schools can't  accomplish this
reform alone. Through multi­level partnerships we  can have a
positive impact on the lives of inner city youth.
