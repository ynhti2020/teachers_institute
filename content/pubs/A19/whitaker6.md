On Common Ground:  Challenges and Responses</h2>
<font size="+1">By Thomas R. Whitaker</font>
</center><hr/>
One reader of <i>On Common Ground,</i> responding to our invitation in
Number 5 for an expression of your views, has asked that the  periodical
become "more gutsy." Number 6 may be a step in that  direction. In
previous numbers we have often emphasized the  accomplishments of
partnerships. In this number, though not  ignoring important
accomplishments, we put the main focus on some  unsolved problems. We have
invited several people to offer their  challenges­and perhaps their
responses­in the difficult area of  educational organization and
change.
<h3>The Essays: Some Connections</h3>
We begin with one who has been a citizen of two cultures. Roland S.  Barth
sketches the unfulfilled dream of close partnership, notes the
impediments that can transform the dream into a nightmare, and  concludes
that universities as well as K­12 schools are desperately in  need of
"restructuring." He would encourage changes in reward  systems, the
creation of more dual citizenships, and efforts to bridge  the gap between
research and practice. But these, in his view, are  just patches on leaky
tires. He therefore concludes with a bold vision  of a single culture, a
"community of learners" which is also a  "community of leaders"­for
he believes that collegiality has not been  recognized as either part of
the problem or part of the solution. Some  writers in this issue will
disagree with Barth on that question­and  indeed we must add that
"collegiality" has been central to the efforts  of the Yale­New Haven
Teachers Institute that we described in  Number 5.
<p>
We turn then to some university administrators, who take rather  different
approaches. Arthur Levine tells us that heads of institutions  and
foundations and an assortment of journalists are the "leaders" in  the
current partnership movement, which he finds to be without  coherent focus
or staying­power. He urges that we develop a "more  clearly defined
agenda for cooperative action." We should note here  that the
Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute, which has always relied  heavily
upon teachers themselves as part of the leadership, now has  an endowment
that will guarantee its permanency. We would be  interested in hearing
from other partnerships that are working  toward that goal.
</p><p>
For a variety of specific suggestions for cooperative action, we may  turn
to Sherry H. Penney, writing with William Dandridge. Schools,  she says,
must be viewed as places where new knowledge is created.  University
faculty and school­based practitioners must share the
responsibility, risks, and rewards of working together on behalf of
children. Schools of education and arts and sciences must reconsider
their curricula. Universities must create support structures and
philosophical contexts for their school initiatives. University reward
systems must be reordered, and better indicators must be developed  to
help universities gauge the benefits of their investment in  partnerships.
The challenge, she thinks, can be met.
</p><p>
Rev. Edmund G. Ryan finds that both reward systems and the  increasing
fragmentation of curricula and structures are obstacles to  partnership.
He also urges that we hear more fully from those who  will employ the
graduates of our school systems. School­university  partnerships must
reach out to include those from the world of work.  Father Ryan here
continues a topic that had been engaged by Thomas  Furtado in Number 2,
and by Secretary of Labor Robert Reich,  Edward C. Kisailus, Thomas E.
Persing, and Thomas Furtado in  Number 3. And in this number, Foster B.
Gibbs provides an instance  of such a successful partnership, the Saginaw
River Project.
</p><p>
What about the role of professional schools other than education?  Gene I.
Maeroff suggests that high schools and professional schools  have much in
common, and that improvements in both might result  from their
partnership. In medical and architecture schools  experiential education
forms a foundation for constructing  knowledge, off campus learning should
be important, and  performance­based assessment is crucial. Maeroff
suggests, however,  that rigid departmental structures have hindered
discourse between  such schools and those in pre­collegiate
education. For an interesting  effort in this direction, we would refer
our readers to Kent C.  Bloomer's account in Number 5 of his architecture
seminar in the  Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute.
</p><p>
Next we hear from a university professor who has been active for  many
years in school­university collaboration, and who has found  the
"human element" to be the most important contribution that the
collaborative movement can make to educational reform. Jay L.  Robinson
offers a forceful argument for the view that people are  finally more
important than structures­though of course they require  enabling
structures in order to make effective contributions­and that
"collegiality" has indeed been recognized in some places as the key to
successful school­university relationships.
</p><p>
We turn then to perspectives from within the schools. In this number  we
inaugurate a "Superintendents' and Principals' Forum," which will
complement our continuing forum, "Voices from the Classroom."  Thomas E.
Persing here sounds a clarion call for all superintendents  to exercise
their leadership in developing partnerships with colleges  and
universities. Charles Serns speaks from a principal's position of  ways in
which school­university partnerships can improve the  instructional
climate in a school, and can help the school to establish  its own
leaders.
</p><p>
In a related article from a superintendent, Foster B. Gibbs offers a
detailed account of how education in the Saginaw school district has  been
transformed by collaborative initiatives undertaken with the  University
of Michigan, Michigan State University, and Saginaw  Valley State
University. Gibbs offers a set of guiding principles for  staff
development that can inform such collaboration. In different  ways,
Persing, Serns, and Gibbs all understand "collegiality" to be a  major
part of the solution.
</p><p>
In "Voices from the Classroom," Carol Keck, Linda Tripp, and Ann  Claunch
offer a case for collaboration based upon their own  experience in the
Albuquerque Public Schools/University of New  Mexico Career Development
Program. They allow us to see how  apprentice teachers, mentor teachers,
and university supervisors can  relate to each other in an atmosphere of
trust, openness, respect and  reflection. It is just that atmosphere, they
argue, that makes possible  growth through collaboration. They here seem
in strong agreement  with Jay Robinson's perspective from the university.
</p><p>
But what about the student perspective? Suzanne SooHoo argues that
students should participate in our dialogue about the restructuring of
education. They should be regularly consulted, or at least informed.  And
she offers an interesting account of how the Alternative  Assessment
Project at Irvine moved in that direction, seeking  student advice and
learning from it.
</p><p>
We conclude this array of challenges and responses by printing three
pieces that are sharply critical of the current situation. Sophie Sa,
Executive Director of the Panasonic Foundation, deplores the  emphasis on
the professional development of individual teachers.  She admits to a
suspicion that "perhaps the people in our teaching  force simply do not
have the capacity to improve." The solution, she  argues, is the
integration of professional development into­overall  improvement
plans for the school. In her view, providers in  universities and
foundations should require participation by school  teams, and allow their
participation only if they can show how the  workshops or courses will fit
into a plan for the whole school. (We  should add here that the
Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute, which  for almost twenty years has
successfully placed major emphasis on  the professional development of
individual teachers, is now working  more extensively with "school teams"
and is helping individual  schools to establish Centers for Professional
and Curricular  Development.)
</p><p>
Deborah Meier, Co­Director of the Coalition Campus Project in New
York, directs her criticism to an entire "ladder of disrespect"­but
especially to the universities. We need, she says, environments in  which
teachers are engaged in thoughtful intellectual effort, in which  students
witness the play of ideas and have reason to join in such  play. It
follows that the "universities' first task, on behalf of school  reform,
is to reform themselves"­for the university must become  what, in
Meier's view, it has not been, "a place that takes the life of  the mind
seriously,...engages in respectful public activity,...treats all  ideas
with respect including naive ideas." Most of our readers will no  doubt
concur with Meier's goals. But those who read carefully Jay  Robinson's or
Foster Gibbs' essays in this number of <i>On Common  Ground</i>­or,
for that matter, the accounts of collaboration in Number  5­will
surely find some reasons to disagree with the sweeping nature  of her
charges.
</p><p>
Kati Haycock, Director of the Education Trust at the American  Association
for Higher Education, is pessimistic about the results of  confining
attention to "handfuls of teachers here and there," and she  too believes
that further progress in school reform will require  radical change in
higher education. She argues for a comprehensive  K­16 reform, with
communities creating umbrella­type structures to  oversee the work.
And she points with some satisfaction to the cities  now participating in
the Education Trust's initiatives­six in  "Community Compacts" and
twenty in "K­16." It will be interesting to  see how such
comprehensive programs engage the complex details of  teaching and
learning in individual schools­and the difficult  problems of funding
and management of school districts.
</p><p>
We end on a firmly positive note, with pages celebrating the lives of  two
men without whose dedication, personal presence, and  professional
accomplishments American education­and the  collaborative movement in
particular­would be much poorer. Fred  Hechinger and Ernest Boyer
both passed away this winter. They were  both strong friends of the
Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute. We  have been grateful indeed for
their contributions to <i>On Common  Ground.</i> But it is of the first
importance, we think, that those who  work in American education not lose
touch with the values they both  affirmed in every essay, book, and
funding decision. Ernest Boyer  sums them up well in his eulogy of Fred
Hechinger: a public love of  children, a reaffirmation of the nation' s
schools, and the struggle to  achieve excellence for all children, not
just the most advantaged.
</p><p>
We hope that this number of<i> On Common Ground</i> will leave you with
some important questions: Will changes in educational structures  really
mean better teaching and better learning? Or should we  concentrate with
increased fervor upon assisting and developing the  persons who teach and
who learn? Or may we somehow pursue both  of those directions at once? In
the 12 May 1996 issue of <i>The New  York Times,</i> Albert Shanker offers
a favorable and pertinent review  of an upcoming article by Stanley
Pogrow, a professor at the  University of Arizona, "Reforming the Wannabe
Reformers" (<i>Phi Delta  Kappa</i>, June 1996). According to Pogrow, the
low success rate among  education reforms results from the fact that those
reforms seldom  attempt to deal with the details of classroom instruction.
As Shanker  puts it, they are "strong on philosophical principles and
advocacy but  weak on figuring out how to put their ideas into the
classroom." We  at <i>On Common Ground</i> vigorously endorse the emphasis
that Pogrow  and Shanker provide. Without real engagement with classroom
instruction, and therefore with teachers and their students,  educational
"reform" will accomplish little.
</p><h3>The Images: Some Perspectives</h3>
E. L. Henry's <i>Kept In</i> seems to us an apt and poignant, if
necessarily  limited, image for both the history of American education and
its  present predicament. We are caught, as Roland Barth puts it,  between
bad dreams and good dreams. But we may have faith in the  creativity and
determination evident in the young woman who is  Henry's subject, and
manifest in Henry's own accomplishment.
<p>
We select therefore as a complementary image Romare Bearden's <i>The
Lamp,</i> one of the remarkable works that this printmaker (a  friend of
Ralph Ellison and Albert Murray) produced as he  interrogated his own
memories, from childhood on to the present.  Though retrospective, this
lithograph speaks to the future: it captures  the love and concern that
are necessary parts of any act of teaching  that is worthy of the name.
</p><p>
With the pieces by Arthur Levine and Sherry Penney, which  emphasize some
of the challenges and opportunities in building  permanent structures, we
include Lewis Hine's photograph of the  "connecters," who, in constructing
the Empire State Building, bolt the  beams as they have swung into place.
This picture is drawn from  Hine's <i>Men at Work</i>, a book of
photographic studies designed for  children, which Alan Trachtenberg has
justly called (in <i>Reading  American Photographs</i>) "a teaching tool."
</p><p>
In connection with Gene I. Maeroff's piece on the ideal relations  between
professional schools and secondary schools, we include  Diego Rivera's
<i>The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City. </i>  In this
self­reflective fresco (Rivera himself being the heavily seated
figure on the scaffold in the central tier), the artist depicts the actual
making of a fresco devoted to the building of a city. Rivera has  captured
here what seems to us a crucial and complex relationship  between the arts
and the community.
</p><p>
To accompany our newly inaugurated Superintendents' and  Principals'
Forum­ with contributors that span the distance from East  to
West­we return to a motif that we highlighted in <i>On Common
Ground,</i> Number 1, with Joseph Stella's <i>The Brooklyn Bridge:
Variation on an Old Theme.</i> Georgia O'Keefe's <i>Brooklyn Bridge,</i>
painted nine years later, gives special emphasis to the echoing and
responsive forms that Hart Crane (in his great poem <i>The Bridge</i>) and
Stella (in a number of versions) had celebrated. This picture was  painted
just before O'Keefe left New York, where she had lived part  of each of
the last thirty years, and moved permanently to Abiquiu,  New Mexico. For
her, as for us, it may therefore be an image of  bridging the continent as
well as the East River.
</p><p>
Suzanne SooHoo writes of "The Loud Silence." We include with her  essay a
painting by Allan Rohan Crite, <i>School's Out,</i> which Regenia A.
Perry has called "a classic example of the approach that earned Crite  the
title of 'artist­reporter' in his Roxbury, Massachusetts
neighborhood during the 1930s and 1940s." Perry finds a "joyous,
carnival­like atmosphere" in this scene of young children emerging
from a redbrick schoolhouse surrounded by an iron fence. Indeed,  Crite's
design and coloring do suggest an animated and festive  occasion. But look
closely at those faces. Can you find any smiles?  Surely there is a "loud
silence" here that needs to be heard.
</p><p>
On our back cover, we carry the magisterial image by George Bellows,
<i>The Big Dory.</i> It may remind us that bridges between shores, or
institutions, or communities are never just static monuments. Every  act
of bridging requires a risky effort, a venturing into untested and
possibly adverse waters, a difficult voyage. We have been privileged  in
the collaborative movement to have had Fred M. Hechinger and  Ernest L.
Boyer, along with many others, as part of the crew.
