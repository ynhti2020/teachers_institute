Partnerships Between Schools and Universities</h2>
<font size="+1">By Deborah Meier</font>
</center><hr/>
The basis of the partnership needed by all manner of adults working on
behalf of the rearing of our young is the recognition of our shared task.
The phrase is "mutual respect."  The relationship historically between the
various adult communities that bear upon pre-collegiate public schooling
has been one of profound disrespect.  Collegiate faculty disrespect
secondary school faculties who in turn disrespect the teachers of the
young who in turn disrespect the children's first teachers their families.
Children, of course, are at the very bottom of this ladder of disrespect.
<p>
If schools are to become powerful communities for the teaching of those
habits of heart and mind central to a strong and vigorous democratic
society we must break this chain and invent a very different way of
imagining the relationships between novices and experts that does not
speak to any form of superiority over one another.  We need, in short a
seachange in the way we see teaching and learning taking place regardless
of the level we work on.
</p><p>
It is by being members of a common community of different and unequal
expertise that we learn most efficiently.  In school or out.  That's the
natural way of learning.  We learn because we imagine ourselves as future
experts, and take notice often quite unconsciously of what such competence
looks and feels like.  Just as I learned to drive long before I was behind
the wheel, as a "back seat driver" in the car driven by my mother, whom I
imagined myself growing up to be like, so do children learn all manner of
things before we get around to teaching them.  The next step seemed far
easier than it would be to one who learned to drive as an adult, without
such prior vicarious experience.  So it is with almost everything we learn
to do well.  So it is too that the absence of such experience handicaps us
forever.  Of course it's not enough to be in the presence of expertise.
One needs to be able to imagine being a member of the club that such
experts belong to; and we must want to join their club.  And finally, the
experts must be willing to make what they do visible and accessible.  In
the end you have to be able to try it out.
</p><p>
If the adults can agree on some of the goals they want for their "shared"
children, what they want them to "try out," then they need  to be sure
that the children have opportunities to witness experts at play.  We
wouldn't expect many ballplayers to emerge from a culture in which no one
ever saw a ball game played.  But oddly enough we expect lots of children
to develop "academic excellence" in the complete absence of ever seeing it
played at all, much less well.  In fact, they have virtually no idea what
it is.
</p><p>
To create schools in which intellectual work is part of the norm being
played out by adults as well as kids, on many different levels, and in
ways that might make kids want to imitate it that's our common task.  We
need environments in which teachers are themselves engaged in thoughtful
intellectual effort, in which their students thus witness such play of
ideas, and in which they have reason to want to join in such play.
That's true for a good university, a good high school, nursery school and
family dinner table.
</p><p>
For this to happen our teachers must themselves enjoy intellectual life.
They must be good at it.  They must enjoy odeling it. In short, they must
have experienced it too.
</p><p>
Our universities' first task, on behalf of school reform, is to reform
themselves.  They need to be models for the adults who pass through them
of what it is like to join a learned community, a place that takes the
life of the mind seriously, that engages in respectful reflective public
activity, that debates ideas seriously and civilly, that ponders evidence
carefully, that treats all ideas with respect including naive ideas.
Teachers who have been part of such adult communities will have an easier
time passing such traditions on to the young, as well as demanding schools
that permit both teachers and students  to exercise their intelligent
judgment.
</p><p>
Then the partnership would be a natural one.  Historians, whether they
were teaching 6-year-olds or 16- or 30-year-olds would share a common
discourse.  Faculties would read each other's papers, join in common
discussions as a matter of course.
</p><p>
Then the expertise of those who can devote more time to their specific
academic subject matter, and less to teaching it to others, would be
welcomed as allies, not seen as patronizing saviors.  Then the teachers of
14-year-olds would be less likely to put-down the teachers of 6-year-olds,
but enjoy their common wonderment at the ways young people think.
</p><p>
Until we have created such respectfulness, the partnerships we need to
build must make the schools for the young the centers of power, not vice
versa.  We need to create school communities in which the faculties have
sufficient time and control to set the terms for working together
thoughtfully and respectfully.  We need to reverse the structure of power
and status, so that we can, over time, reconstruct the kind of equality
the task really deserves.
</p><p>
In the meantime, universities must do some learning themselves to reinvent
university life along the same lines as we need to do in our secondary and
primary schools.  There's no task that isn't proper and fitting for one
that isn't on the agenda for the other.  As we discover how much we face
common concerns, we'll better work out how to do the job together.  When
college teachers no longer think it's a compliment to say that a first
grade teacher is smart enough to teach on a college level, but take it as
one when a teacher of the young says, "you know, you'd make a good
kindergarten teacher!" then we will be able to talk partnership on better
terms. Meanwhile, there's no harm in lending a helping hand.  We all need
it.
