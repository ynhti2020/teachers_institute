School and University:  Bad Dreams, Good Dreams</h2>
<font size="+1">By Roland S. Barth</font>

<hr/>
Schools and universities are lively and peculiar places. Where the  two
cultures intersect is even more lively and even more peculiar. I  have
spent most of my adult life working in schools, as an  elementary teacher
and principal, and in universities, as a teacher  and administrator.
During much of this time, a foot rested in each  world. For instance,
while principal I worked closely with a  university which placed a dozen
student teachers with us each year.  And when I began the Principals'
Center at Harvard I found myself,  at once, a resident of both school and
university.
<p>A close partnership between school and university is a powerful  dream
offering exciting possibilities for educators and enriched  learning
experiences for youngsters Across the fence lie invigoration,  new ideas,
different ways of thinking about learning, knowledge, and  teaching... and
the unknown. But, despite notable exceptions, this is a  dream as yet
unfulfilled.
</p><p>Many impediments transform the dream into a nightmare. Few  school
teachers and administrators in their careers have escaped  being
disappointed, demeaned, infantalized, or embarrassed by  universities.
Expectations have been held out and violated at the pre­ service and
in­service levels and in courses, workshops,  consultations, and
evaluations. And I know of few university faculty  members who have worked
closely with schools who haven't been  badly scratched up by the briar
patch of the schoolhouse. Schools are  unforgiving places for academics,
places that reject foreign bodies as  a human body rejects organ
transplants. The respect, capacity for  reflection, success, and
recognition that professors may enjoy within  the ivory tower seldom
accompany them into the schools.
</p><p>Thus, both school and university people bring to new partnerships
antibodies each has built up toward off the other. It seems to many  in
the university that school people want to improve things without  changing
them very much; from the point of view of school people,  university folks
offer to change things but without improving them  very much. These are
hardly promising conditions for close  cooperation.
</p><p>There is common agreement these days that most of what educators  do in
K­12 schools is desperately in need of "restructuring." I would  say
the same about universities. The problem of all educational  institutions
isn't that they are no longer what they once were. The  problem is that
they are precisely what they once were, while the  world around them is
changing in revolutionary ways. It should  come as no surprise then that
the relationship between school and  university is equally in need of
reform, renewal, rethinking...and  restructuring.
</p><p>
A major barrier between school and university is that neither  rewards
very much those crossing the border between them. Few  professors work in
public schools and few school people work in  higher education. If one is
not rewarded by the host culture for  entering its boundaries, neither is
one rewarded by one's own  culture. Academics are not promoted for talking
to PTA's, for  consulting with classroom teachers, or for themselves
teaching in the  schools. First­class citizenship comes from reading,
writing, scholarly  research, and distinguished teaching. And not enough
teachers and  school administrators are rewarded by their systems with
release  time, pay increments, tenure, or public recognition for entering
universities where they might read, write, reflect, and work. First­
class citizenship in schools comes not from evidence of adult learning,
but from promoting learning on the part of students and fostering
satisfaction on the part of parents and supervisors. This is pretty  much
the way things have been. But things are changing.
</p><p>
Many noteworthy practices "out there" offer, I think, promising
directions for strengthening the relationship between school and
university and for moving towards the elusive dream of partnership.
</p><h3>Research</h3>
Traditionally, research has been the province of academia. To be  sure,
the stereotype of the remote academic, posing the questions,  generating
the ideas, diagnosing the problem, formulating a research  design,
conducting the research, and then offering prescriptions to  schools to
which teachers and principals respond­or don't­still holds  some
credence. One school administrator, for instance, recently  observed that
"Researchers start from a different place and serve a  different public
than do practitioners. The ideas and questions that  inform their work are
often irrelevant if not downright bewildering­ to those who work in
schools or send their children there." (Ann  Cook, as quoted in
<i>Education Week,</i> September 28, 1994.)
<p>
Happily, we are observing promising changes. More and more  university
researchers are coming into schools and classrooms as  ethnographers to
see what's going on there. Some even create a dual  citizenship whereby
they live in and are compensated by the  university part­time, while
they live in and are compensated by the  school system the other part.
Conversely, some school people are  taking part­time responsibility
in the university (developing  curriculum or engaging in teacher training,
for instance) while  remaining in the schools the other part. There is
probably no more  powerful symbol and more promising way of integrating
the two  cultures than dual citizenship.
</p><p>
Additionally more and more school people are actively collaborating  as
"co­researchers" with academics. These partnerships can bring the
best of each culture to an examination of important questions of  teaching
and learning. The firsthand experience and craft knowledge  of school
people work alongside the research methodology and  academic rigor of the
academic.
</p><p>
And more school people, especially teachers, are conducting their  own
form of research...posing questions, carrying out investigations,
reflecting on new learnings, and changing their practice accordingly.
These "practitioner­researchers" enjoy, need, and increasingly find
support, encouragement, technical assistance, and recognition from  the
university. And recognition is the commodity in least supply to  school
people these days.
</p><p>
The issue, then, is not whether school people know or can find out  much
of value to themselves and to others, but rather under what  conditions
they will reveal their rich craft knowledge so that it may  become part of
the discussion to improve schools. The voices of  school people who have
long occupied the place of what the academic  calls the "dependent
variable" are now coming to be heard as  "independent variables"­and
better still, as "interdependent  variables."
</p><h3>Running Things</h3>
A major obstacle to the close association between universities and
schools has to do with the locus of theory and the locus of practice.  The
common rhetoric says, "Theory resides in universities and  practice
resides in schools." I find this conception both disturbing and
inaccurate.
<p>
I know of no school teacher or principal who does not work from  some
organizing principles or, in university language, from a theory.  Theories
about teaching, parent involvement, curriculum  development, and
motivation abound in schools. Some of these  school­based theories
are good, some fragmentary, and a few elegant.  Be that as it may, school
"practitioners" are theory­makers as well as  theory­consumers.
</p><p>
Conversely, most of my former Harvard colleagues are practitioners  who
run and do things as well as think and write things. Academics  run
schools of education, departments, committees, and research  projects.
Most also practice as classroom teachers. A professor is no  less a
practitioner than a teacher. Some university people are good
practitioners, some bad, some modest, many immodest, and a few  elegant.
School people and academics must jettison this typecasting  around theory
and practice if they are to work helpfully together.
</p><p>
A major forum for fruitful school and university cooperation then is  "the
running of things." Here, too, we are witnessing hopeful  realignments and
possibilities.
</p><p>
Universities have long run certification programs for aspiring  teachers
and principals. It is not uncommon these days for teachers  to be involved
in, and even responsible for, training and inducting  their colleagues
into the craft. Principals in some states have become  authorized to run
seminars, institutes, and internships which prepare  and certify their new
colleagues.
</p><p>
And universities, which, with the exception of some laboratory  schools,
have seldom gotten their hands into administering schools,  have joined
the fray. Boston University's takeover of the Chelsea,  Massachusetts
Public Schools is a notable example. And the  movement towards "charter
schools" is involving more and more  higher educators in actually
designing and operating schools. In most  of these efforts each culture
enlists the assistance of the other.  Committees with responsibility for
program, budget, and personnel  include not only school and university
people, but parents and  community members.
</p><p>
In short, school practitioners and university practitioners are  beginning
to cross the boundaries which separate them. They are  being rewarded for
doing so, finding satisfaction in it, and making  valuable contributions
to the other culture.
</p><h3>A New Dream</h3>
Although these evolutionary changes can be seen as "restructuring,"  they
hardly constitute what we call these days "a paradigm shift."  They are,
in my view, rather the application of fresh, strong patches  onto
defective, leaky tires. I wonder, just what would constitute a  paradigm
shift in our thinking about the integration of higher and  lower
education? Let me conclude with a vision: What if "schools and
universities" were not two places, occasionally intersecting, but  rather
one place where all the time, teaching, learning, and research  were
occurring? What if human beings from pre­school to post­
graduate occupied the same geographic location and constituted an
inter­generational community of inquiry? What if we refused to
accept the given that there must be two distinct cultures and,  instead,
created, anew, one culture, a "community of learners?" What  if every
citizen of this "school" were committed to the same goals: to  be a
life­long learner; to discover new knowledge; to help design and
construct the learning organization; to share in the decision making;  and
to live and work as colleagues? What if?
<p>
How much more likely it would be that young people would become
life­long learners if they could each day observe, experience, and
work with adults who were lifelong learners. How much more would  teachers
and youngsters learn if they were part of a culture replete  with role
models of reflective practitioner, scholar, and researcher?  And how much
more would the older scholars learn from the  persistent presence of the
younger scholars? And how much more  relevant would the scholarship be?
Research would be everyone's  work. The ten­year­old researching
the inhabitants of pond water  and the doctoral student researching the
inhabitants of pond water  could become colleagues in researching pond
water. "Teachers" and  "students" would never again be seen in the same
way. Nor would  the pond water.
</p><p>
Strangely, collegiality is seldom mentioned in the school reform
literature of the past decade. It is recognized neither as part of the
problem nor as part of the solution. Relationships in schools­all
schools­take several forms. One of them is described by the
wonderful term from nursery­school teachers' parlance, "parallel
play." Two three­year­olds are busily engaged in opposite
corners of  a sandbox. One has a shovel and bucket; one has a rake and
hoe. At  no time do they share each other's tools. Although in proximity
and  having much to offer one another, each works and plays pretty much
in isolation. This description serves remarkably well as a
characterization of human relationships in school and university  alike.
</p><p>
My experience in schools and universities suggests that the nature of
relationships between adults and adults, between youngsters and
youngsters, and between adults and youngsters has much more to do  with a
school's quality and character, and with the accomplishments  of student
and teacher alike, than does anything else. Why accept  primitive
relationships? Why not deliberately reconstruct these  relationships and
transform them from parallel play to collegiality?
</p><p>
What would happen if, in addition to becoming a community of  learners,
the new "school" were to become a community of "leaders?"  In a law firm
partners are vitally involved in running the larger  organization as well
as their particular practices. In schools and  universities,
administrators tend to look after the larger organization  and the
teachers and faculty look after their individual classrooms or  research.
I believe it far better for everyone to look after the whole
organization...for the sake of the organization and for the sake of
everyone.
</p><p>
How much more a learning environment could teach the values and  spirit of
a democratic system, to which we profess to be committed, if  it resembled
more a New England Town Meeting than a benevolent  South American
dictatorship. And how much richer the experience of  all the inhabitants
of the learning community would be if each were  expected to, allowed to,
and helped to make decisions leading to the  ongoing development of a
community of learners and leaders.  Leadership is making happen what you
believe in. A school can  accomplish no higher goal than to empower
everyone­students,  teachers, administrators, parents­with the
confidence and ability to  make happen what they believe in.
</p><p>
A dream? Perhaps. But also a vision toward which we might move as  we
consider the future of the school­university relationship. And a
dream which might help select, integrate, and reinforce the best of  the
school culture with the best of the research university, while  purging
the current pathologies of each. There is much common  ground­and
much high ground­here. What if?
