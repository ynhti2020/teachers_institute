University­School Collaboration and Educational Reform</h2>
<font size="+1">By Jay L. Robinson</font>
</center><hr/>
Thomas Toch ends his valuable examination of "the struggle to  reform the
nation's schools" with a chapter titled "Conant Was Wrong:  The Human Side
of Schools." Near the end of the chapter, while  acknowledging that
"significant strides have been made on some  reform fronts, especially in
the campaign to professionalize teaching  and in strengthening the
academic training of the nation's top  students," he worries that progress
will be lost, and quickly, "unless  dramatic changes are made in the
climate in the nation's public  schools, unless schools become places
where teachers want to teach  and students want to learn." A change in
climate, he argues, is of  especial importance for students who have
typically not done well in  school, students usually labeled "the
disadvantaged":
<blockquote>...the education of disadvantaged students is unlikely to
improve  without dissolving the alienation and apathy that pervade so many
of the nation's public secondary schools. Unless schools "reach"
disadvantaged students, instilling in them a sense of belonging and a
measure of enthusiasm for learning, other reforms are unlikely to  help
them, and the central goal of the excellence movement, the  broadening of
public education's academic mission, is likely to fail.  Indeed, unless a
human element is added to the reform movement,  the gulf between the
educational haves and have­nots in public  education and in the
nation is likely to increase....
</blockquote>
University­school collaboration has made its own special
contributions to what Toch calls the excellence movement, with many
programs contributing significantly to the improvement of academic
preparation for students and the professionalization of teachers. But
perhaps the unique and most important contribution the  collaborative
movement can make to educational reform is to add the  "human element."
And to its credit, the movement has committed  itself both to the "haves"
and to the "have­nots" in America's public  and private schools.
<p>
Attending to the human element to the persons behind the titles  "teacher"
and "student," to the very human relationships that must  be established
for collaboration to work is the central task in  collaborative projects.
As educators, our various titles "professor,"  "teacher," administrator"
most often serve to separate us, as do our  roles and responsibilities in
our separate institutions. Those of us  who work in collaborative projects
find ourselves struggling to find  new titles for ourselves: "partner"
serves sometimes, because it  implies a common aim and joint
responsibility in working toward it;  "colleague" can be useful as long as
its use is sincere an  acknowledgment of equality of status and as long as
its users  realize that a new kind of collegiality has to be worked for to
overcome separations that have been institutionalized and assigned
differential status. In good collaborative projects, one hears the title
"friend" more often than is customary in most professional  gatherings,
and first names are often all that is needed. Some  students I worked with
(in partnership with my friend and colleague  Sharon Floyd) long enough to
learn their first names came to call me  "Doctor Jay." I hope the name
acknowledged my humanity more than  my degree, but even the playfulness of
the name suggests the  distances that in fact separate an inner­city
classroom from the office  of a professor in a self­consciously
prestigious university.
</p><p>
Our struggle to find names for participants in collaborative projects is
a healthy one, in human terms, and can be a useful reminder that in
undertaking such work we are inevitably trying to establish new
structures for educational change. Our capitalist, probably not post­
capitalist, society has flourished through specialization of expertise
and through the assignment of differentiated roles, responsibilities,  and
rewards. The structures of our work separate us, as a glance at  any
institution's table of organization (certainly mine) will show, as  the
breakdowns in communication across unit boundaries show even  more
clearly.
</p><p>
Most collaborative projects I know, and know to be effective, are  problem
centered, and the participants in them are, or at least  include, those
who are primarily responsible for finding solutions for  the problem.
Teachers must be the active participants in  collaborative projects and,
given the current status attached to the  title "teacher," empowerment
must be one of the project's aims.  Empowerment comes more easily and the
term empowerment makes  more sense, when both school and university
partners call  themselves "teacher" and when there is mutual recognition
of both  common and differential experience and expertise, common and
different needs and aims. In collaborative projects, all teachers have  to
be learners as good teachers always are; university teachers  especially
must see themselves in the role of learner, never in the  role of
"professor," even though their specialist knowledge of subject  matter is
likely to be a valuable contribution to the joint work.  Effective
projects often include administrators among their  participants to insure
that innovations have some chance of finding  their place a more stable
one in existing structures and among  budget priorities. But
administrators in projects must at least  imagine themselves as teachers
who have things to learn about life  in classrooms.
</p><p>
Putting things in more human terms: as a university partner, I have  found
a recognition and confession of my own ignorance one of the  best
contributions I can make to the opening conversations about  work that
will be done in collaboration. Even though I am a willing  learner and a
pretty good observer, I'll never know as much as my  school colleagues do
about the circumstances of their work in  classrooms, about the shapes of
learning as these are influenced by  forces within the school and in the
community; about the lived­lives  of students and how those lives
shape learning; about perspectives  on subject matter that emerge in
illuminating and valuable ways  when one's charge is to teach all young
comers in their quite  splendid diversity of capacity and background. In
collaborative  projects, local knowledge of the kind Clifford Geertz
writes about is  essential knowledge, and neglecting it can lead to
offering silly  solutions for serious problems.
</p><p>
Some years ago, a group of us spent many frustrating hours planning  a
sequenced curriculum for some English classes for at­risk students.
We made a nice curriculum, but we didn't know how to make it work  until
we faced the problem that really got in the way of our students'
learning. These were not dropout students we were seeking to serve;
rather they were drop­in students who attended class irregularly,
often seemingly at whim, students whose lives outside school offered
little in the way of sequence as those of us who are more privileged  in
some ways understand such a concept. One student, an able one as  we were
to find out, fed and dressed three small siblings before he  could think
about getting himself ready for school; the night before,  he worked until
midnight to earn his essential share of the family's  income. More than a
half of the students in our classes were  themselves real, not surrogate,
parents and most took their  responsibilities seriously.
</p><p>
To meet these students' needs, we had to think of much more than
curriculum; to give them the sense of belonging that Toch talks  about, we
had to try to restructure schooling to accommodate, in so  far as we
could, to the shapes and realities of these students'  everyday lives to
give them what so many wanted: a glimpse of  possibility, a chance at
learning that might help them re­shape the  lives they led. In
circumstances like these, the human element is the  essential one; it must
inform any curriculum that has as its end  academic achievement. The human
element is no frill; it is both basic  and the basis of any learning.
</p><p>
In collaborative projects, participants always meet in a
<i>borderland,</i> a  space that has recently been named by scholars who
are interested  in examining new structures of interaction that emerge
when  members of separate cultures find themselves, for whatever reason,
living together and working together. Trying to find one's way in a
borderland, old maps help some, but new maps must be drawn.  Walking on
unfamiliar ground, people have to find new ways to talk  together if they
are not to get hopelessly lost; working together for a  first time, people
have to find unaccustomed ways of interacting. In  Saginaw, Michigan, an
inner­city district providing space for a  borderland called what we
were doing "Staff Development;" but what  emerged from our steps onto
strange land took shapes unfamiliar to  most who use that well­known
term. As colleague explorers, we  negotiated the borders of our unfamiliar
territory, moving from the  Staff Development Center into classrooms,
homes, and community  centers; we translated for one another when we found
our separate  languages inadequate to our new tasks; we tried for a
language of  friendship when silence, or angry disagreement, threatened
such  common citizenship as we were struggling to form.
</p><p>
Structural change inevitably results when work is being done in a
borderland. In Saginaw, joint talk about expectations for student
literacy led to new modes of writing assessment, modes that are now
district practice; teachers' daily schedules were changed to provide  more
time for collaborative planning; classroom locations were  changed to
facilitate that planning and to enable both team teaching  and friendly
collegial talk; conversations about expectations and  assessment opened
the way to experiments and innovations in  teaching practices and to the
discovery of unsuspected student  capacities; experiments in team teaching
and with cross­age peer  tutoring led to a teacher initiated move to
abolish all tracking in  Saginaw's language arts classrooms. Work in a
borderland invites  even demands innovation; and when the inhabitants of a
borderland include both students and the administrators who are
responsible for effecting beneficial change for their good, maps can  be
purposefully redrawn.
</p><p>
A school where I have worked as a university partner has adopted a  motto
that serves to remind me of what I am or should be doing  when I venture
from my comfortable study into a borderland. The  school, an alternative
one in a tough Detroit neighborhood, uses this  as a guide for their
efforts toward educational change and  improvement: "It's the children,
stupid!" Few people miss the  deliberate allusion to a similar motto, used
in a recent presidential  campaign, which for many now serves as an
adequate shaping end  for American education: children imagined as
commodities, as  "human capital," in a competitive corporate marketplace.
Fortunately,  most teachers and many administrators know full well that
the  children they see everyday are many more things than prospective
employees, that their minds and imaginations can be kindled by  other
goods than productivity and profitability, or what can be  purchased in a
mall. In this school, "kid­watching" is the research  method teachers
use to find out what kids are learning and whether  or not they are
learning; kid­watching offers the added value of  finding out how
many good things children can be if our teaching is  made accountable to
them, if our schools provide "a human element"  all too absent in all too
many American institutions. In Saginaw, we  found out that drop­in
students attended more regularly when we  worked hard to make classrooms
places they wanted to be places  where they would be treated humanely,
places where their very  human problems, hopes, and aspirations could be
articulated and  responded to.
</p><p>
Workers in collaborative projects, workers in the borderlands, might  do
well always to ask these questions: Where in our plans for change  is the
human element? Are the structural changes we are proposing  likely to
instill in students, "disadvantaged" or not, "a sense of  belonging and a
measure of enthusiasm for learning?" No structural  change is ever likely
to be as important as are the changes we can  make in the ways we perceive
and respond to one another as human  beings.
