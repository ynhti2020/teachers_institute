<p><i>The world seems mad in preoccupation with what is specific,
particular, disconnected." 
<br/> (John Dewey, </i>Democracy and Education, <i>
1916)</i>
</p><p>
Those of us committed to collaboration between higher education and  K 12
schools continue to search out pathways for creating long- term
partnerships among our educational institutions.  Vito  Perrone's
<i>Collaboration in Historical Perspective </i>is a valuable  contribution
to our movement which suggests fundamental  unchanging attributes of
successful collaboratives.  My comments  focus on two significant issues:
(a) the similarities between  Perrone's historical examples and our work
in California; and (b) the  changes in educational institutions that are
essential to sustaining  and expanding the collaboratives movement and
realizing its  benefits.
</p><p>
In 1983, the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and Santa Ana  Unified
School District formally entered into an academic  partnership known as
the Student/Teacher Educational Partnership  (Project STEP).  During this
period the Santa Ana school district, the  largest in Orange County, had
changed dramatically in its  demographic composition, and the question of
how to improve the  college/university preparation of its student body had
become one of  shared critical concern.  In 1985, our partnership expanded
to  include Rancho Santiago College, CSU Fullerton, and Chapman
University.
</p><p>
From its inception, STEP was designed as a collaborative that  corresponds
to many of Perrone's descriptors, including mutuality of  exchange,
creation of an equal partnership in the struggle for high  quality
educational programs, empowerment of those in the schools,  and a shared
determination to develop the kinds of collaboration that  would be most
useful.  These are indeed the characteristics that  have been most evident
in successful academic partnerships.
</p><p>
To share our experience with others, we wrote <i>To Advance Learning:  A
Handbook on Developing K-12 Postsecondary Partnerships</i> (Manuel  N.
Gómez, et.  al., University Press of America, 1990).  The  dimensions
of successful collaboratives we found to be paramount  parallel those
cited by Perrone.  The starting point is the dimension  of leadership: top
level leaders of UCI, the Santa Ana school  district, and our other
partners were and have continued to be  committed to genuine
collaboration.  There was clear recognition  that we were dealing with two
different cultures and that we had to  overcome not only institutional
barriers but also the profound  differences in organizational cultures
between the university and  the K-12 schools.
</p><p>
As in the historical cases of John D.  Pierce at the University of
Michigan, John Dewey at the University of Chicago and the Bank  Street
teachers described by Perrone, the leaders within both  educational
institutions were highly committed to "school/college  collaborations that
.  .  .  had a quality of reciprocity that made for  equality .  .  .
[and in which] .  .  .  The agendas, the purposes, and the  conditions
were mutually derived." (Perrone, <i>On Common Ground,</i>  Summer 1994,
p.  7) Perrone's historical examples also describe the  quality of
collaboration that has characterized Project STEP­the  reciprocity of
authority, the emergence of teachers who became  enormously articulate
about education matters, and the binding  together of those within and
outside of classrooms for a common  purpose.
</p><p>
In <i>To Advance Learning: A Handbook on Developing K-12  Postsecondary
Partnerships, </i>we identify operational features of  successful
collaboratives necessary or the realization of the shared  vision of
mutuality.  The methods needed to cross institutional  boundaries in order
to create co-equal working relationships among  K-12 and postsecondary
institutions, and to achieve mutual goals,  are complex.  Strategic
development of the following dimensions is  especially important:
organizational structures; interinstitutional  teams; fiscal and human
resources; meaningful participation;  objective evaluation; continuous
communication; and ongoing  leadership and momentum.  While Perrone's
analysis was not aimed  at identifying operational features of historical
cases, this is a  separate analysis well worth undertaking.
</p><p>
Perrone describes, in the last section of his paper, some of the  changes
in institutions of higher education that are needed to  sustain
collaboratives.  As Perrone notes, "universities must accept  a broader
than usual view of scholarship, .  .  .  value conversations  and inquiry
related to teaching <i>and</i> learning, understand the  importance of
interdisciplinary [and, I add, interinstitutional]  collaboration,
understand the necessity of long term involvements,  and affirm mutuality,
a parity of authority." (Perrone, p.  9) In  Project STEP, we continue to
grapple with these fundamental  parameters.
</p><p>
We are not there yet, and I doubt whether any institution of higher
education can achieve and sustain the changes in institutional  culture
that are needed to maintain ongoing substantive cooperation  for a
significant period of time without changes on a national level  that
relate to collaboration.  New institutional structures and  faculty
motivation for involvement in collaborative efforts are  currently ad hoc
on the campuses where they do exist.  Across the  nation, it is not
commonly an expectation that colleges and  universities will have a top
institutional leader responsible for K- 12 school collaboration, as there
are individuals responsible for  academic programs, research, student
services, and the like.  I  believe that we must invent a new permanent
structure within  colleges and universities that helps further motivate
and advance  ongoing cooperation between universities and schools.
</p><p>
However, institutional structures for guiding and sustaining long- term
collaboration with K-12 schools are only part of the equation.   Faculty
recognition and rewards must also be changed to include this  dimension.
A different type of research must, as Perrone notes, be  recognized for
its legitimacy and excellence.  Research deriving  from collaborative
projects will often lead to different products,  such as improved school
practices, new instructional methods, and  higher-level curricula.  These
can be documented and evaluated, as  scholarly papers have been for so
many years, but the commitment  must exist to invent new procedures
</p><p>
What are the benefits of K-12 school/college and university
collaboration, and do they justify significant departures in the
structures and norms of postsecondary institutions? The answer is  "yes"
on at least two counts.  Experience of successful  collaboratives has
shown significant increases in the preparation of  secondary students for
higher education.  In Project STEP, the  numbers of students from Santa
Ana attending postsecondary  institutions have increased from 40% to more
than 57% in a six-year  period, and the success and retention rates of
these students have  been unusually high.
</p><p>
The fundamental question that we should be asking as we consider
collaboration with K-12 schools pertains to what we believe should  be the
roles and responsibilities of our institutions of higher  education, and
how our society should be investing and providing  more, not less,
critical support to our teachers and young people.  If  higher education
is to remain vital, we must respond to the problems  of our society, and
as the experience of cooperative agricultural  extension programs has
demonstrated, the greatest contributions of  universities to society's
problems require mutuality and  collaboration.  The current educational
partnership movement  enables colleges and universities to make profound
contributions to  our nation's schools, teachers,  students, families and
communities.   The institutional sructures, values, and incentives of our
educational institutions must change to make this important
responsibility a reality.

<h3>by Charles S. Serns</h3>
Collaboration as a whole, and university-K12 collaboration in  particular,
is something that does not seem to have high value in our  society.
While the politically correct rhetoric talks exhaustively  about
learning<i> about</i> each other, little seems to be being done about
working <i>with</i> each other either as people or as institutions.   As
we  increasingly divide ourselves into sides or groups, it seems as if we
do not have the tools to join together for the common good.   Part of
this inability may stem from the fact that children are seldom  allowed to
truly collaborate in school settings and they are often not  in
environments where they see effective collaboration taking place  among
adults.   Children are exposed to a series of educational  settings in
which few adults can articulate the big picture of the  learning process.
Certainly, if collaboration was an actual cultural  norm, time would be
allocated for people to collaborate as a valued  process and the
collaborative process itself would be respected.
<p>
Vito Perrone's excellent perspective on university-school  collaboration
cites several examples of learned communities setting  up collaborations.
The collaborations, with only a few exceptions,  have not been embedded in
the culture of education.   The  widespread lack of collaborative
endeavors among elementary  schools and universities highlights the
condition of elementary  education as being seen as out of the loop of a
collaborative dialogue  about teaching and learning in its formative
stages.
</p><p>
Granted these observations are generalizations, but if one truly  wants to
develop collaborative models in schools, there are some big  questions
that remain unanswered.  Perrone's article serves as a  springboard for
these questions:
</p><ul>
<li>Why is there a lack of "mutuality" among learning institutions? It
seems as if we are programmed to accept that these bodies should  never
mingle.   It is a waste­of time, of money and of the potential  for a
common understanding about teaching and learning.
</li><li>
Why are the conversations about teaching and learning limited to the
college of education and random meetings of teachers? It would  seem that
every university would want to engage in examining how  people learn.
People do not learn best at any one particular age.    However, they do
learn differently at different ages; a fact that,  because we are divided,
is not well utilized.
</li><li>
Why is it the notions of equality and partnership in education often  do
not include the learner as teacher and the teacher as learner? It  seems
that the value of such inquiry is lost in issues of turf, control,  and
self serving regulation.
</li><li>
Why is it that those who regale public school educators have such  disdain
for the very people who are charged with shaping the nature  and scope of
inquiry in students? The universities that see no need  for high quality
teacher preparation programs with high academic  rigor seem to doom
themselves and our future.
</li><li>
Finally, why do both universities and schools thwart the things that
Perrone points out, such as interdisciplinary collaboration, parity of
authority, mutuality, and articulated dialogue regarding teaching and
learning? It seems as if the answer serves as an unwitting partner in
those things that continually divide us.
</li></ul>
While these questions may pose a bleak setting, there are answers.
Answers are found in the very best elementary school classrooms  which
provide micro learning communities.   Teachers facilitate  learning
experiences that integrate skills and content and connect  practice an
experience.   Collaboration is done in a mutually  supportive environment
which expects continuous learning.   Many  lessons can be learned from
this model.
<p>
Clearly, by Perrone's description and from a cultural imperative, we  need
to find ways to collaborate.   This collaboration must be part of  our
essence as educators.   To do less relegates us to small  mindedness,
fearfulness and loneliness.   When we refuse to  collaborate, we fail to
empower one another and we fail to celebrate  the strength of our
diversity.
