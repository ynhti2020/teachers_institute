<h2>
New Directions for Collaboration</h2>
<p><font size="+1">by Ernest L.  Boyer</font>

<hr/>
More than thirty years ago, I was director of the Center for  Coordinated
Education at the University of California, Santa Barbara.   This project
had grown out of urgencies triggered by the Soviet  Union's successful
launch of Sputnik.  There was a flurry of concern  about how well our
schools were doing, and the Center was created  to establish more contact
between them and the university.
<p>
All educational institutions in Santa Barbara County­from  elementary
schools to the university­joined together in a loose­knit
consortium.  And I worked for the governing board that represented  all
levels.  As part of our mandate, we developed a cluster of  projects-from
curriculum planning to teacher training programs.   Looking back, the
Center was an experiment with both vision and  inspiration.  School and
college leaders did communicate carefully  with each other.  Still, gains
were marginal at best.  While  experimental projects were introduced,
thanks in part to a Ford  Foundation grant, it was difficult to sustain
systematic change.   Resources were limited, day-to-day pressures were
distracting, and  the campus crises of the late 1960s forced other
priorities on  administrative leaders.
</p><p>
Three decades have passed, the challenges confronting American  education
are even more urgent, and today no one seriously doubts  that higher
education has a responsibility to work closely with  schools.  Colleges
and universities with all their talent and resources  can no longer be
spectators.  Many of our classrooms are filled with  students who are
falling by the wayside, dropping out.  Many others,  who do make it to
graduation, lack the requisite skills for further  education, for
effective citizenship, and for success in life.
</p><p>
I am convinced that we must, in the next five years, immerse  ourselves in
collaboration.  The time has come to acknowledge that  education is a
seamless web and that all levels of education are  inextricably connected.
But how is this to be accomplished?
</p><p>
First, in the decade that lies ahead, collaborative efforts must focus,
not just on schools, but most especially on children.  The harsh truth  is
that, in America today, nearly one out of every four children under  six
is officially "poor." They are undernourished, disadvantaged,  struggling.
If we continue to neglect poor children, both the quality  of education
and the future of the nation will be imperiled.  We  know, for example,
that brain cells develop before birth, and yet  one-fifth of all pregnant
women in this country receive belated  prenatal care­or none at all.
We know that all malnourished babies  are two to three times as likely to
be blind, deaf, or intellectually  deficient, and yet nearly half a
million children are undernourished.   The social and human costs of these
deprivations are tremendous,  and the fact that a country as rich and as
well­educated as ours  tolerates such conditions speaks unfortunately
to our foolishness and  to our shortsightedness.
</p><p>
But what does all this have to do with higher education? For  universities
and colleges to ignore the deteriorating health and  education of the
youngest generation is not unlike the vision of the  snake who feasts on
its own tail.  Funding priorities, college  standards and goals, and even
the availability of promising students  will all be affected by this
neglect.
</p><p>
I believe that higher education must recognize that the nation's first
education goal­that all children will be ready for formal schooling
by  the year 2000­is the most essential goal of our six educational
goals.   For all children, this means good nutrition, a stimulating
childhood,  and good arenting.  In a very practical way, it also means
that higher  education must become an active partner in the process.  Last
year,  for example, at the Texas Woman's University, I visited a residence
hall that had been converted into apartments for single mothers and  their
children.  While the mothers worked and attended classes at  the college,
the youngsters were cared for in a day care center run  by college
students.  And the Nursing School at the University had a  medical clinic
for mothers and babies at a nearby housing project.
</p><p>
As well as becoming actively committed to helping single parents  complete
their education, other roles are available to institutions of  higher
learning.  In a recent Carnegie Foundation report called <i>Ready  to
Learn,</i> we suggest that both two- and four-year colleges take the  lead
in training preschool teachers.  It's a disgrace that we are  trusting our
youngest children to those who are often poorly  educated and who are paid
far too little.  We know that children  need continuity of care, yet the
turnover rate in many of these  centers is sometimes 40 percent each year.
Preschool teaching is an  undervalued profession that must be given status
and recognition in  the culture.  Some colleges are already developing a
response to this  critical need.
</p><p>
Dutchess Community College in New York grants an associate degree  in
early childhood education.  About half of those who graduate teach  at
child care centers, and the rest transfer to four-year programs.   Miami
Dade Community College has a 62-credit child-care degree  program, and the
college also has established a "satellite" public  school on its campus to
help preschools make the transition to  elementary education.
</p><p>
The Bank Street College of Graduate Education in New York offers  graduate
programs in early childhood education, with an infancy  program and a day
care program.  Bank Street also has a Child  Family Center, which serves
children six months to four years of age  and is a demonstration site for
teacher training in infant care.  Efforts  such as these demonstrate the
vital role that higher education can  play in advancing school readiness
in the nation.
</p><p>
The second issue is that while all children must be well prepared to
learn, it is equally essential that schools are ready for the children.
After a decade of focusing reform efforts on the upper grades, the  time
has come to concentrate on improving elementary education as  well.  The
gap between preschool years and the elementary schools  also must be
bridged.  And restructuring kindergarten through grade  five in a way that
taps the full learning potential of all children  should become a national
priority.
</p><p>
Several years ago, I proposed that we reorganize the first years of
formal education into a single unit called the Basic School.  The Basic
School would combine kindergarten to grade four.  It would give top
priority to language, and every student from the very first would be
reading, writing, engaging in conversation, listening to stories, in  what
the foreign language people like to call the "saturation method."
</p><p>
I've spent forty years in higher education.  College education is  surely
consequential, and I love to teach undergraduates.  But the  years of
early formal education establish the foundation of all future  learning.
If this country would give as much status to first grade  teachers as we
give to full professors, that one act alone would help  revitalize the
nation's schools.
</p><p>
I'm suggesting as a second priority that school-college partnerships
focus on primary education.  In this arena, the collaboration provides
the ideal forum for modifying the education of elementary teachers.   In
addition to more short-term institutes for practicing elementary  teachers
and arranged exchange relationships for mutual mentoring  and growth
between teachers and college students, there should be  increased
expectations for college students to volunteer not only in  child care
centers but in afterschool programs as a way of widening  their own
understanding about people and to benefit the young  students.  Another
way that the collaboration should exist is by  colleges and universities
reexmining their course offerings in the  schools of education with the
counsel of professional teaching groups.   Given the political exigencies
of such matters, this is not an easy  exercise.  But with the growing
agitation for improved education,  those institutions that raise
standards, that offer courses that inspire  creativity instead of rote
methodology, that require aspiring teachers  to be truly
well­educated in their fields of speciality­and in the  case of
young children, this means great understanding of human  development and
capabilities as well as domains of knowledge­those  institutions will
become leaders in the educational revolution that is  fomenting.
</p><p>
Third, in the coming decade school-college collaboration must return  to
the central issue of what we teach.  Colleges and universities have  a
responsibility to develop with the schools a curriculum with more
integration and coherence.  Today almost all colleges have a  requirement
in general education.  But all too often this so-called  "distribution
requirement" is a grab bag of isolated courses.  Students  complete their
required credits, but what they fail to gain is a more  coherent view of
knowledge and a more integrated, more authentic  view of life.  And what's
even more disturbing is the way colleges  impose the old Carnegie units on
the schools, requiring students to  complete credits in history and
mathematics and science and English  without asking what's behind the
label.
</p><p>
The Carnegie Foundation created the Carnegie unit eighty years ago.   High
school students were applying to college from places colleges  didn't know
existed, much less what kind of program they offered.   The Carnegie unit
was meant to set standards, and it worked in its  own way, but it fails
now because it focuses on seat time rather than  substance.  It is time to
bury the old Carnegie unit.
</p><p>
The truth is that the old academic boxes do not fit the new  intellectual
questions.  Some of the most exciting work going on in  the academy today
is in the "hyphenated disciplines,"­in  bioengineering and psycho
linguistics and the like­in what Michael  Polanyi calls the
"overlapping academic neighborhoods."  Anthropologist Clifford Geertz, at
the Institute for Advanced Study,  in his fascinating book called Blurred
Genres, says that "these shifts  in the disciplines represent a
fundamental reconfiguration of  knowledge.  Something is happening,"
Geertz says, "to the way we  think about the way we think."
</p><p>
During the coming decades, we will see a fundamental reshaping of  the
typology of knowledge as profound as that which occurred in the
nineteenth century when philosophy was submerged by science.   And
wouldn't it be tragic if a nineteenth-century curriculum design  continued
to be imposed on schools at the very time scholars were  redefining the
structure of knowledge for the twenty-first century?
</p><p>
This collaboration of educators at all levels, then, can be forged not
only by common goals but by common questions: What do we want  our
children to learn and be able to do after sixteen years of formal
education? Wouldn't it be exciting, as we move toward the next  century,
if we would start to rethink the nature of the new  knowledge that relates
not to the last century but to the coming  century? How can we organize
knowledge in a way that seems to  make it relevant and powerful for
students in the days ahead?  Wouldn't it be exciting if both kindergarten
teachers and college  professors could view knowledge using understandable
categories  that would be newly integrated and would spiral upward in
common  discourse? Wouldn't it be exciting not only to build connections
across the disciplines but to build them vertically as well, from
preschool through college?
</p><p>
The new directions for collaboration between colleges and schools  must be
on the early years­preceding school itself and on the very  first
grades­as well as on what students are actually taught at the
beginning of formal classroom work.  If we're truly serious about the
attainment of quality education for all, then we have to be equally
serious about building a better foundation for learning, a new­truly
ew­design of curriculum and expectations, and a professional level
of collegiality among teachers at all levels.  In this way not only will
our schools be better served, we also can have, in the longer run, a
profound impact on the future of higher education.
</p><p>More than fifty years ago, Mark Van Doren wrote: "The  connectedness of
things is what the educator contemplates to the  limit of his capacity."
Van Doren concluded by saying that the  student who can begin early in
life to see things as connected has  begun the life of learning.  And
this, it seems to me, is what school  and college collaboration is all
about­connections.
