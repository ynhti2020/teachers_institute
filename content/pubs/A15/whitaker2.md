On Common Ground: Learning to Pull Together</h2>

<hr/>
The essays and images in this number of <i>On Common Ground </i> put an
emphasis on the strength that can be found in the historical ancestry  and
the present variety of the partnership movement. The Editorial  Board last
year was firm in its desire that an early number should  place our present
efforts in historical perspective. And at its latest  meeting, the
Editorial Board spent a good deal of time viewing  possible images for
this and future numbers, and coming to a  consensus about the most
appropriate uses of images to accompany  the essays. A few words, then,
about each subject.
<h3>The Essays: Some Connections</h3>
Too often, in recent decades at least, educational proposals have  been
made and programs have been launched without sufficient  attention to what
can be learned from those who have gone before  us. Too often those
proposals and programs have themselves then  proved to be of short
duration. Indeed, the most usual pattern of  funding collaborative
projects in this country, through short-term  initial grants rather than
sustained institutional support, has only  accentuated the weakness of our
collective memory. The  "collaborative movement" of the past fifteen years
has often been  ahistorical in its orientation and rhetoric. The lead
essay by Vito  Perrone therefore reaches back to inform or remind us of
earlier  collaborations in Michigan, North Dakota, Illinois, Maryland, and
elsewhere, and then points toward a considerable variety of present
efforts on local, state, and national levels. It is a history from  which
we can take heart, and one that ought to inspire us to find yet  more
useful ways of sustaining what Perrone calls "a collaboration  over time
that is empowering for teachers and students alike." 
<p>
We also print responses to Perrone's essay from two members of the
Editorial Board:
</p><p>
Manuel Gómez focuses on the similarities between Perrone's
historical examples and the work done by Project STEP in California,  and
on "the changes in educational institutions that are essential to
sustaining and expanding the collaborative movement and realizing  its
benefits." Among those necessary changes, he argues, is the  invention of
"a new permanent structure within colleges and  universities" that can
provide sustained motivation for ongoing  cooperative programs. (The
current effort of the Yale-New Haven  Teachers Institute to create a
permanent endowment to support its  activities as a recognized unit of the
University is one such change  now in process.) Gómez also calls for
some important revisions in  the values and incentives of our institutions
of higher education, in  order that they may respond more adequately to
the problems of our  society.
</p><p>
Charles S. Serns probes the reasons behind the relative absence of
collaboration on the education scene. Among his points is one that  Ernest
Boyer develops: elementary schools have been left out in the  cold in most
of the collaborative dialogue between universities and  schools. (We might
point again to the Yale-New Haven Teachers  Institute as one attempt to
overcome this problem. Beginning with a  focus on high schools, and soon
incorporating middle schools, the  Institute has been regularly including
elementary school teachers  since 1990.) Serns also notes that the best
elementary school  classrooms offer an integrative model of collaboration
that  deserves attention from all parts of the educational community. 
</p><p>
Ernest L. Boyer's piece also looks to both past and present  collaborative
efforts in order to find clues to the major tasks for  the decade ahead.
Above all, he says, we must ensure on a national  level that "all children
will be ready for formal schooling." He also  urges that school-college
partnerships focus on primary education,  and that they return to the
central issue of "what we teach." 
</p><p>
Lauro F. Cavazos, responding in part to the essay by Secretary of
Education Richard W. Riley in our inaugural issue, urges that the  federal
government make it clear that teacher preparation is an  important
priority. He is especially concerned about the small  number of minority
teachers now in school systems, and he argues  that we must overcome the
inadequacy of current training to prepare  young teachers to meet the
linguistic and cultural needs of inner- city schools. 
</p><p>
On this occasion Fred M. Hechinger's regular column also stresses  teacher
preparation. He urges an expansion of collaboratively- sponsored
internships as a replacement for the "student teaching  component" of
teacher training.
</p><p>
As we were preparing this number of <i>On Common Ground, </i> we learned
of the death of Edward J. Meade, Jr., a long-time advocate of  teachers,
and friend of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. At  the Ford
Foundation, Ed Meade directed its efforts to improve the  professional
abilities of teachers. He was head of the urban poverty  program from 1977
to 1989. He possessed great regard for  individuals who sought his advice
and support, admonishing us not to  be diverted from our own true
purposes. His belief in the power of  teaching in public schools lives on,
in part, in an endowed Institute  in New Haven for which he is
responsible, in a significant way. On a  memorial page, we include some
excerpts from his lecture of 1985  on the task ahead. His comments on
needed reforms in teacher  preparation, and needed reforms in the schools
themselves, in order  to make them more stimulating places of learning for
both students  and teachers, have lost none of their urgency.
</p><p>
Other pieces in this number focus more specifically on current  programs
and challenges. On the federal level, Therese K. Dozier,  herself a former
teacher in the schools, reports on the meeting of  teachers from across
the nation that she convened in Washington to  provide advice to the
Department of Education. Among other points,  she stresses the need for
teachers' participation in collaborative  planning, for adequate time
during the day to allow them to be  professional educators, and for the
overhauling of teacher  preparation programs and staff development.
</p><p>
From the world of business, Thomas Furtado lays out the need for  some
frank talk among educators and businessmen about what can be  done to
enable more fruitful and long-term collaboration. Furtado  has been
especially concerned with the difficulties encountered  when businesses
and schools seek to go beyond an <i> ad hoc</i> gift of  computers and
shop equipment. This is a subject about which we'd  like to hear more in
the future. 
</p><p>
And from the university, Antonio Lasaga comments on the  opportunities and
challenges that are provided by the "information  superhighway" and
related developments in computer technology.  Much has been done in the
last few years, but much more remains to  be done. Here as elsewhere, our
technological capabilities seem to  outrun our readiness to make the most
effective educational use of  them.
</p><h3>The Images: Some Perspectives</h3>
The Editorial Board has come to a number of conclusions about the  images
in this publication. We want them to complement the essays,  to be of
intrinsic artistic interest, and to suggest further  possibilities for
incorporating the visual arts into the curriculum.  We therefore believe
that the images should be thematic, and not  narrowly illustrative. We
want them to express an array of vantage- points on our
topics­historically and stylistically. We think they  should
represent, over the longe run, the cultural diversity of our  nation and
our world­and the possibility of building a community  from that
diversity. 
<p>
And yet we do not ask of a given image that it conform entirely to  our
editorial point of view. After all, among the virtues of works of  art is
their ability to provide vivid testimony to what an artist can  see, feel,
and think from within a historical or cultural situation.  They invite our
appreciation­and our interpretation, even criticism.  We incorporate
them into our lives and our educational projects by  noting what they say,
and what they don't say, and something of why  that should be the case. 
</p><p>
That should be evident from Winslow Homer's <i>Snap the Whip,</i> which
accompanies Vito Perrone's essay. It provides an eloquent image  drawn
from the history of American education. It depicts a youthful  and, as
John Dewey would surely appreciate, playful collaborative  endeavor by
various talents on a common ground. Learning to pull  together, even while
sometimes appearing to pull apart, is the task  we inherit. And yet a
probing look at that image may well leave us  unsatisfied with its vision
of our task. Though it "celebrates  connectedness," in Jules Prown's
phrase, it also recognizes and may  well accept division and insularity.
The "watching girls" that Prown  observes are clearly out of the game.
What preparation for social  roles may be suggested by this separation of
passive females from  active males? Not one that we would endorse today.
And what about  racial and ethnic inclusiveness? Homer's painting reflects
the  narrowness, and the limiting social assumptions, of a New England
rural community in 1872. Only through that distorting lens does it  offer
what Jules Prown calls Homer's vision of "the natural  condition of
childhood." Here as everywhere, the "natural" is socially  conditioned,
and we need to recognize that fact without depriving  ourselves of a rich
heritage of resources. 
</p><p>
For just that reason, we find it appropriate to complement Homer's  vision
of 1872 with Jacob Lawrence's vision of 1978. Lawrence's <i> Library,</i>
which accompanies Fred Hechinger's column, also limits  itself to a single
moment, a single race, a single activity. But it too  reaches out to
capture something of the energy, diversity, and co- operative spirit of
the educational scene. The flatness of this  design, with its rather
schematic figures, is charged with an  extraordinary vitality. Books are
all over the place, at all angles. Old  and young are finding sustenance.
And Lawrence, whose works often  pay tribute to manual labor and
craftsmanship, has here placed in  the foreground, at a compelling angle,
those capable hands that bring  everything into focus. Something of the
breadth of our task will  come to mind only as we think of Homer and
Lawrence together.
</p><p>
And yet more will come to mind as we think of our two other  images,
neither of which portrays a human figure. The page from  Celia Alvarez
Muqoz's<i> Which Came First: Enlightenment #4, </i>which  accompanies the
essay by Cavazos, combines a photograph of five  eggs, a printed statement
about childhood difficulties in learning,  and a child's handwritten
sentence. The larger design is apparently  simple; but, thanks in part to
that proverbial riddle about the  chicken and the egg, it alludes to
problems that have to do with the  reciprocity of language and
learning­and to the role that art may  play in their solution. But
this is only the first panel in a brief book  that tells a more complex
and humorous story. Each panel portrays  the eggs, continues a printed
narrative, and offers another  handwritten sentence struggling with the
verbs "lie" and "lay." The  narrative recalls the childish question, "How
does a chicken lie a  egg?" "I was always corrected and told, 'A chicken
lays an egg  through its mouth." The last panel reveals that the previous
photographs have given us a "lying" accuracy: when the eggs are lined  up
before us, they are obviously of different sizes. Early in her  career,
Celia Muqoz worked for seven years in the El Paso public  schools,
teaching most of the regular subjectswith a relation to art;  and she has
produced many of her recent works in collaboration with  students.
</p><p>
Peter Halley's acrylic composition,<i> Total Recall, </i>which accompanies
the article by Lasaga, is a "simpler" though no less sophisticated  design
that points toward a technologically complex process of  communication:
electronic computing. Here an impression of the  structure of a computer
chip becomes a quiet icon of the circulating  and recirculating
connections that we associate with the  "information society."
</p><p>
We would like to acknowledge with gratitude several people who  have
assisted the Board in the selection of artwork for this and  future
issues: Robin J. Frank, Kenneth Haltman, James Weiss, Bryan  J. Wolf, and
Jules D. Prown. And we would also like to acknowledge  that our format in
certain respects derives from that of the <i> Carnegie Quarterly</i>. The
Editorial Board had reviewed various  newsletters and bulletins, and was
particularly taken by the  attractiveness of the Winter 1993 issue of that
<i>Quarterly</i>. More  recently, we have received very helpful advice on
matters of  typography and format from Roland Hoover.  
</p><p>
We would also like to acknowledge our very great indebtedness to  the
Carnegie Corporation of New York, whose support makes this  periodical
possible.
</p><p>
We should also note that, though the text of <i>On Common Ground </i> is
not copyrighted, we cannot make that statement about the images in  each
issue. The artwork may not be reproduced without permission  from the
owners cited in "Credits" on page 3. 
</p><h3>Join the Conversation! </h3>
If you have thoughts about the essays, the images, or the topics  more
generally, we encourage your responses­either as letters to  the
editor or as brief statements for submission. We are very much  interested
in hearing from teachers who have found ways to  incorporate our images
into their work in the classroom.  If you have  suggestions for topics to
be considered, or artwork to be included,  we would welcome them. You may
easily reach us by E-mail. Our next  few numbers are plotted out very
roughly, but we are open to ideas  we haven't entertained.
<h3>Looking Forward</h3>
At its most recent meeting the Editorial Board sharpened and  elaborated
its plan for the next five numbers of <i>On Common Ground</i>.  The major
questions to be addressed are these: What contributions  can university
school partnerships make to teaching and learning  about cultural
diversity? What changes need to take place in schools  and colleges in
order to support partnerships, and to enable all  teachers to become full
partners? How can university-school  partnerships proceed in the arts? Can
they assist in the task of  integrating subject-matters and creating
communities? What  contributions can such partnerships make to the
preparation of  students for the world of work? And what contributions can
they  make, perhaps with the help of business, in the areas of science and
technology?
