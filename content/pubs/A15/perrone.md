<h2>University-School Collaboration in Historical Perspective</h2>
<p><font size="+1">by Vito Perrone </font></p>
</center>
<hr/>
<i>On Common Ground</i> begins with the premise that colleges,
universities and schools should be in collaboration.  And, in fact,  there
are many good examples of collaboration which I will comment  upon.
Nonetheless, even with the large public policy and popular  media rhetoric
about the need for a seamless web, higher levels of  reciprocity between
colleges, universities, and schools, significant  collaborative exchange
is not yet common enough.
<p>
I am often asked, in this regard, Why aren't more high school  students
doing more of their academic work in the colleges and  universities? Why
isn't there a more formal connection between the  ways writing is taught
in the high schools and in the colleges and  universities? Why do the
purposes for historical, scientific and  literary studies differ so
greatly across levels? Why is there so little  conversation between high
school and college/university teachers of  history, literature,
mathematics and science about curriculum and  pedagogy? The
disconnectedness between schools and colleges-the  isolation, lack of
mutuality, different expectations and discourse-is  too common.  And it is
enormously wasteful.
</p><p>
Fortunately, the climate for moving beyond where we are now is  improving.
Fresh possibilities for closer relationships and greater  flexibility seem
possible on a larger scale.  Before considering the  possibilities and
potential difficulties, however, I believe it would be  useful to gain
some historical perspective-to examine some of the  larger landscape.  Our
contemporary disconnectedness, as you will  note, has not always defined
the relationship.
</p><p>
In 19th Century America, for example, there was a blurring of the  lines
between secondary schools and colleges and universities-in  large measure
because of the formative nature of these institutions.   The University of
Michigan's 19th Century history is particularly  interesting in relation
to school-university connectedness.  The  original conception of the
University of Michigan, rooted in Judge  Augustus Woodward's System of
Universal Science, called for the  University to be a complete
territory-wide system of education to  include "colleges, academies,
schools, libraries, museums,  athenaeums, botanical gardens, laboratories,
and other useful literary  and scientific institutions" (Dunbar, p.  281).  
</p><p>
How much more inclusive could one get? Even as I admit to the
complexities inherent in Woodward's formulation, I am attracted to  his
basic understandings of the inter-connectedness of knowledge  and the
importance of diversity in relation to the sources for  learning, as well
as his acknowledgment that learning needs to be  conceptualized for a
lifetime and not for a particular period of time.   While Woodward's grand
conception was abandoned by 1827 as  impractical, the University was still
viewed, for decades later, as the  critical base out of which a cohesive
state system of public education  would be constructed.
</p><p>
In 1837, under the leadership of John D.  Pierce, Michigan's first
Superintendent for Public Instruction, a state system of education  was
carefully articulated.  The University of Michigan was not only  viewed as
the capstone of this system; it was expected, in addition, to  assume a
connecting role to elementary and secondary schools by  establishing
mediating branches-essentially multipurpose secondary
academiesÂ­throughout the state.  Pierce wrote in this regard that
each of the proposed branches would occupy "the middle ground,  being
connected on the one hand with the primary schools by the  establishment
of a department ...  for the education of teachers and  on the other, with
the University itself, by the establishment ...  of a  preparatory course
...  thus being equally designed for the benefit of  the University and
[local communities]" (Dunbar, p.  401).  Now all of  Pierce's hopes didn't
materialize but the roots-as well as the  intentions-of mutuality were
clear enough.  It was a vision of  common purposes that had counterparts
across the United States.
</p><p>
In 1879 the University of Michigan reaffirmed, this time internally,  its
commitment to interact with the schools by establishing a  pioneering
chair in the Science and Art of Teaching.  In announcing  the chair and
its importance to the University, President William  Angell made clear the
University's intent to recapture some of  Pierce's hopes.  From this
modest beginning emerged an  experimental University high school, a system
of school accreditation  and field services, and a fully elaborated school
of education.
</p><p>
The University of North Dakota, where I spent many years, is also  fairly
representative of this nineteenth century collaborative spirit.   Founded
in 1883 at a time when there were virtually no secondary  schools in the
Dakota Territory, the University was forced to provide  for its first
twelve students a two-year preparatory program.  It  wasn't until 1904
over twenty years later-that the preparatory  school, which generally
enrolled more students than the collegiate  programs, was closed.  The
same faculty taught across the two levels.   Shared purposes and
curriculum continuity existed.  Students went  from Greek and Latin
programs in the preparatory school directly to  more advanced Greek and
Latin programs in the college.  The same  was true in other academic
fields.
</p><p>
In addition to this direct campus and curricular linkage, the  University
became also the center of an emerging system of  secondary schools across
the state.  University faculty in the various  subject fields worked with
secondary teachers on curriculum and  assessment practices and were deeply
involved in the preparation of  new teachers.  In fact, the University
President, Webster Merrifield,  was the State Inspector of High Schools
from 1891-1909, a task he  took seriously (Geiger, p.  114).  In this
role, he was responsible for  developing curricular standards and
graduation requirements for  high schools.  Not surprisingly, Webster
Merrifield was honored at  his retirement in 1912 as the "father of
secondary schools" in North  Dakota.  The linkages were real.
The stories of the University of Michigan and the University of North
Dakota and their connections to schools in their respective states
demonstrate a direction in which the universities were first  organized
and then a wide range of relationships were established  with schools.
The reverse direction was also true in North Dakota,  Michigan and
elsewhere.  For example, the 19th Century Normal  Schools, first begun in
Concord, Vermont in 1823 and then rapidly  part of the educational
landscape across the United States, as the  Common School Movement took
shape in the 1840s, were essentially  secondary schools whose purposes
gradually expanded.  Ultimately,  they became the state colleges and
universities of our nation.  But  their involvement with the schools
remained their defining character  well into the 1930s.
</p><p>
It needs to be noted that much in what I have described in the  foregoing
accounts can be found also in the nineteenth century  histories of such
universities as Harvard, Wisconsin, Chicago, Johns  Hopkins, Columbia and
Illinois, to mention only a few.  Harvard, for  example, was deeply
involved in curriculum development with and  for the schools, believing
that the movement from high school to  college should be more natural, the
connections useful.  The Harvard  curriculum for high schools was an
important effort to raise the  quality of high school education.  My
overall point in the foregoing,  and I acknowledge brief, accounting was
to establish that  interactions between colleges, universities and schools
were  relatively common and consciously pursued.  I will continue with an
element of this historical review because I want to convey an  important
message about the substance of some of the earlier  exchange.
</p><p>
The life and work of John Dewey provide a particularly illustrative
starting point.  Shortly after reaching Chicago, after a formative  decade
at the University of Michigan, Dewey began putting some of  his
educational thought into action in a school which he and his wife,  Alice,
organized.  This endeavor resulted in a body of powerful  literature
produced by Dewey that was influential in his day and  continues even now
to possess considerable meaning; literature  produced by others in the
school, such as Ella Flagg Young, Katherine  Camp Mayhew and Anna Camp
Edwards, that has for many years  influenced school practice
constructively; and practical experience in  university-school
collaboration which provided excellent examples of  how to integrate
university faculty, especially in more traditional  arts and science
fields, into the life of a school.  Moreover, the Dewey  School clearly
furnished constructive models of inquiring into  questions of curriculum,
teaching and learning.  What emerges for  me-and I commend in relation to
this aspect of Dewey's work a re- reading of <i>The Child and the
Curriculum</i> (1902), <i>School and Society </i> (1899), and <i>The Dewey
School</i> (1936) in particular-is the validity  and importance of
educational settings where university scholars and  classroom teachers can
consider together a range of theoretical and  practical formulations about
teaching and learning.
</p><p>
Dewey's efforts at Chicago, and, for that matter, much of the work  that
characterized the related progressive movement in American  education,
contributed to what I have come to label as an important  reciprocity of
authority, an essential aspect of school-university  collaboration that is
critical if current interests in connectedness are  to be realized at the
highest levels possible.  Progressive philosophy  encouraged, for example,
teachers to become close observers of  children and young people,
materials and their uses, and  instructional practices.  Many teachers
became enormously articulate  about education matters, easily the equals
of the pedagogical scholars  in the colleges and universities.  The school
college collaborations  that resulted had a quality of reciprocity that
made for equality.  The  agendas, the purposes, the conditions were
mutually derived.  I am  convinced that some of the projects that pass for
educational  research these days, emanating principally from the
universities and  often entangling teachers in the name of collaboration,
would have  been rejected as simple-minded and wasteful by these powerful
school people.
</p><p>
While there is a large historical literature that could be examined as  a
way of understanding issues of reciprocity, a particular reference I
often suggest to those who wish to think more about university- school
collaboration is Lucy Sprague Mitchell's <i>Our Children and Our
Schools</i> (1950).  Essentially the record of a very large effort linking
Bank Street, then a group of teachers who believed in the need for a
"give and take between research and practice," and the New York  Public
Schools, it documents well the collaborative experience.  It  gives
important attention to the relationships that were built-a  binding
together of those within and outside of school classrooms, of  the
practitioner-researcher and the external scholar-researcher.
</p><p>
Why go through this addition to the historical journey? Quite simply,  I
wanted to make as clear as possible the belief that collaboration,
however conceptualized, should, at its best, lead to greater  empowerment
of those in the schools, enabling them, among other  things, to be more
equal partners in the struggle for high quality  educational programs, in
the writing of critical educational literature,  in decision-making about
what kinds of educational research are  necessary in relation to teaching
practice, and in the determination of  what kinds of collaboration would
be most useful.
</p><p>
Historically, the Child Study Movement, introduced as a major focus  for
pedagogical study at Johns Hopkins in 1896 and the University of  Chicago
in 1898, becoming a national movement in the early decades  of the
twentieth century, was built around the forgoing formulation  (Brandt,
1980; Cremin, 1962).  Teachers a the elementary and  secondary levels were
encouraged to be documentors of children's  learning and their teaching
practices, being able in the process to be  active contributors to
knowledge and the developing field of  educational psychology.  Many
teachers and university professors  were in ongoing conversations about
matters of teaching and  learning.  The intellectual exchange for those
participating was by all  accounts invigorating.  John Dewey's belief that
teachers needed to  be students of teaching, persons capable of reflection
on their  practice, independent in thought and confident as decision
makers,  related closely to the Child Study Movement and was carefully
nurtured in the pre-World War II period through university-school
collaborative structures.
</p><p>
Efforts to reestablish such school-university collaboration related to
intellectual exchange, pedagogical practice and what is often termed
teacher research are currently emerging.  The Bay Area writing  project,
along with its affiliated ventures such as the Urban Sites  Writing
Research project, is one such direction.  It brings teachers  and
university faculty together around an active writing agenda.   While the
expectation is that students in the schools will be better  served through
this interchange, the professional growth of teachers,  the reciprocity of
exchange is the real story.  The work of the English  Composition Board at
the University of Michigan has had a similar  outreach dimension.  Its
work has produced a wonderful community  of readers of writing to emerge
in a large number of schools.
</p><p>
Another long-standing effort of consequence is the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute which annually brings teachers and Yale faculty
together around a series of seminars which focus on new scholarship  in
various academic fields as well as ways of bringing this  scholarship into
classrooms.  The expertise of both university faculty  and elementary and
secondary teachers is critical to making this  effort a success.  This
Yale related activity is being emulated at many  institutions across the
country with similar results.  The University of  Minnesota College of
Arts and Science is now in its third year of  doing so.  And Harvard will
host its first Teachers Institute, modeled  fully on the Yale experience,
in the spring of 1994.
</p><p>
Another outgrowth of this kind of exchange is the American Council  of
Learned Societies' Project which brings together classroom  teachers in
the humanities with university humanities scholars to  explore jointly the
intellectual traditions of the various humanities'  fields and work
together on humanities curriculum.  ACLS Projects  exist currently at
Harvard, the University of Colorado, the University  of Minnesota, the
University of California at San Diego, and the  University of California
at Los Angeles.  The foregoing examples, of  course, just barely touch the
surface of what is developing.
</p><p>
The kinds of efforts I have just outlined lead to high levels of
mutuality.  They represent directions we need to foster on a larger
scale.  But a number of other kinds of interchanges also exist.  There
are, for example, a multitude of fairly standard programs in which  high
school students take a portion of their academic or technical  coursework
in post secondary institutions such as community  colleges and
universities.  The State of Minnesota, among others, has  encouraged such
directions.  For the most part, however, these  efforts do not result in
very much communication among teachers  across the two levels, generally
being defined narrowly as programs  aimed at benefiting students
exclusively.  
</p><p>
There are also programs such as Simon Rock (Bard College) where  high
school students begin full-time college level work in what would  normally
be their tenth or eleventh grades of high school.  Simon  Rock has
attempted to share with secondary schools the ways  students respond to
academic course work, the approaches faculty  there are taking to
curriculum, skill development, and the like, but  the impact seems not to
be high, the reports remote from the  discourse of most secondary school
educators.  This is unfortunate  because the Simon Rock experiment has
much to offer secondary  schools in regard to the broad issues surrounding
expectations.
</p><p>
There are also a number of minority recruitmentÂ­support programs
related to the health fields at the University of Alabama, the City
University of New York, and the University of North Dakota, among  others,
in which students are identified in the schools as ninth  graders and are
the recipients of a variety of collegiate experiences  aimed at
encouraging their interests in science, mathematics and  study skills.
While these efforts make some important connections to  the general
interest in student transitions across the upper levels of  schooling,
they don't seem to generate much fresh discussion about  teaching and
learning or curriculum in the schools themselves.
</p><p>
The Boston desegregation case of the mid-70s brought an interesting
history of collaboration when each college and university in the  Boston
area was assigned by the court a school, or set of schools, to  work with.
The expectation was that these collaborations would  result in better
schools.  With just a few exceptions, however, these  efforts struggled
for the initial five years, in part because of the  post-desegregation
confusion which existed in Boston, but also  because most of the colleges
had so little experience with any long- term relationship with a school.

An interchange that has fueled considerable discussion is Boston
University's recent agreement to run the Chelsea School system.  By
bringing the resources of many parts of Boston University to bear on  the
needs of the schools, some general improvement has occurred.  It  is
currently a bit one-sided but the potential for a collaborative spirit  to
emerge exists.  In the current climate of "Charter Schools" we will
likely see more schools developed with these kinds of close ties to
colleges and universities.
</p.></p><p>
There are also some teacher exchange programs in existence- essentially
visiting teachers and scholars.  By having university  faculty teaching on
occasion in the schools and teachers from the  schools teaching in the
colleges and universities, more commonalities  of understanding are
possible, a base for constructive discourse  established.  These kinds of
exchange activities were more common  in the 1960s and early 70s than in
the past decade but the  possibilities are large and need to be
reformulated.
</p><p>
The Teacher Center movement across the country has also served as  an
excellent vehicle for promoting school-university collaboration.   The
Institute for Teaching and Learning at the University of  Massachusetts
Boston has served this teacher-center function,  drawing heavily on
University resources broadly in such areas as  multicultural and bilingual
education as well as in "writing across the  curriculum." In North Dakota,
there are now nine regional teacher  centers with the University of North
Dakota serving as the  coordinating-collaborative agent, providing a large
array of human  and curriculum resources.  Each of the state's public
colleges and  universities is connected to at least one of the centers.
</p><p>
There is also a long tradition of curriculum development activity  with
potent school-university connections.  The major curriculum  efforts of
the 1960s-ESS, PSCS, BSS, and Project Social Studies, among  others-had
their origins in these linkages.  And the current computer  activities
associated with Logo, Seymour Papert's work described so  well in
<i>Mindstorms</i> (1981), grew out of several MIT-school  collaborations.
Even as collaborative exchange is increasing, however, we are far  short
of what existed at the turn of the century.  The need to move  forward, to
a more solid common ground, is absolutely essential-not  just for the
health of the schools but for the health of the colleges  and universities
as well.
</p><p>
Before closing, I should comment briefly on some of what I have  learned
over many years of working closely with university-school
collaborations-issues which must be considered.  At the university  level,
there has to be an institutional commitment to such a direction,  one that
provides time, accepts a broader than usual view of  scholarship, comes to
value conversation and inquiry-related  teaching and learning,
acknowledges the importance of  interdisciplinary collaboration,
understands the necessity of long- term involvements, and affirms
mutuality, a parity of authority.  At  the school level, similar
commitments are needed.  Time is more  difficult to control in the schools
but it needs to be considered.   Greater teacher autonomy is also
necessary as is support from  principals.  An openness to dialogue,
alternative structures, greater  diversity of materials and schedules is
also needed to sustain a  collaboration over time that is empowering for
teachers and students  alike.
</p><p>
Collaborations that focus on the technical aspects of education- teaching
grammar, introducing computer programming, developing  SAT preparation
courses-aren't very interesting or productive over  the long run.  Those
which make connections to critical social and  intellectual issues have
more potential; for example, considering  ways of assuring higher levels
of communication skills and literacy  writ large for minority, and low
income students, bringing a school- wide focus to writing, linking more
effectively school curriculum  with community resources, trying to
understand how various  students enter the world of reading or come to
understand the logic  of mathematics, or assisting teachers in documenting
growth,  reflecting on pedagogy, materials, and curriculum content or
identifying critical barriers to learning.
</p><p>
Now I realize that I have covered a vast terrain.  My major point,  what I
want to leave with, is that our separateness is in many ways a  scandal, a
serious waste of human and fiscal resources.  But we are  capable of doing
better.  The history as well as current practices have  some high moments
to inspire us.
