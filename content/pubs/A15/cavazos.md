<h2>
The Role of the Federal Government in Enhancing Teacher Education</h2>
<p><font size="+1">by Lauro F. Cavazos</font>

<hr/>
Teacher education is currently in a state of turmoil, unrest, and
uncertainty. The poor performance of America's schools despite a  decade
of education reform has increased the pressure on teacher  educators to
take the initiative in reforming their programs. This  may prove difficult
for them because teacher education is often a  low priority at most
colleges and universities. Another failing of  higher education is that it
does not appear to value the mission and  purpose of teaching among its
own general faculty. Too many  institutions have emphasized research at
the expense of teaching in  making hiring and tenure decisions.
<p>Colleges and universities need to rearrange their priorities to
reflect the pressing need for effective teaching and better teachers  at
all levels of our education system. At the same time, Colleges of
Education must lead in bringing about major reform and change on  how we
prepare teachers; that is where teacher improvement must  start.
</p><p>The concept that the federal government has a major or significant
role in teacher education is not valid. It is true that the funds
requested in the Goals 2000 Act and the Improving America's  Schools Act
of 1993, contain welcomed support for professional  development for
teachers. Both of these bills, however, have other  education objectives.
Teacher education at the university level is  not emphasized. The federal
government needs to target teacher  education directly in stand alone
legislation and not as part of an  omnibus bill on education. This would
serve to focus the attention of  the nation on teacher education.
</p><p>
The federal government should make it clear that teacher  preparation is a
priority and that teachers are a national resource.  Then, funding needs
to be provided for innovative teacher education,  for programs that target
minority teacher recruitment, and for  increased collaboration between
universities and schools in the  preparation of teachers. For example,
schools and Colleges of  Education can work together to blend education
innovation concepts  into the teacher education programs at the
undergraduate and  graduate levels. Further, the school systems should
provide  opportunities for their teachers to return to the College of
Education  for continuation education programs or courses. There they
would  learn about innovative teaching methods and concepts that would
renew their teaching skills, and thereby enhance student education.
</p><p>
Beyond appropriating funds to initiate teacher education reform, the  role
of the federal government should be limited to monitoring and  assessing
the results. The details of improving teacher education  should be left to
the schools and colleges. In response to funding  support, universities
should direct their priorities toward the  pressing need for effective
teaching and better teachers.
</p><p>
The reforms we are seeing today in teacher education, led by some  of the
Colleges of Education, are aimed partly at undoing the  mistakes of the
past and empowering professional educators to  organize their schools and
teach to the best of their abilities. School  based management will create
the kind of entrepreneurial  environment that will reward professional
initiative and innovation.  It is based on respect for the ability of
professional educators to  create effective schools where all children can
learn.
</p><p>
There is no single model that can effectively reform teacher  education.
Ways must be found to attract and prepare talented  persons to teach under
the widely differing conditions found in  America's classrooms. The best
way to ensure quality teaching for  all children is to permit the aximum
flexibility in teacher education  programs, limited only by the need to
maintain accountability for  outcomes.
</p><p>
There should be three overarching objectives for any teaching  program.
First, graduates must know how to create active learning  environments.
Second, all teachers must have a thorough  understanding of the subject
they teach. Third, all teachers must be  educated to meet the challenges
of cultural diversity in our schools.  One of the most striking aspects of
teaching in the 21st century will  be the diversity of students who will
be in America's classrooms.
</p><p>
Over thirty percent of public school enrollment is now minority. By  the
end of the first decade of the 21st century, they will comprise  more than
50 percent of the students in twelve states. This changing  population
poses some special challenges and problems for teachers  and teacher
education.
</p><p>
Many of these minority students speak a language other than English  at
home. Social and cultural differences can present extra  challenges to
teachers. Encouraging feedback from students  experiencing difficulties,
communicating effectively with parents,  and overcoming gaps in student
preparation are a few examples of  areas in which minority students may
require special attention.
</p><p>
Too many young teachers today find their training for a suburban
education environment to be inadequate for the inner city school  system
where they are most likely to find jobs. Most teachers will  not be able
to draw on their own experiences to meet the  instructional needs of a
disparate population, so it is critical that  teacher education programs
provide the necessary background and  training. It is important for
teachers to see themselves as part of  the community in which they teach,
even if they live elsewhere.  Schools must be careful that staff attitudes
about poverty and  ethnic background do not bias their teaching approach
to minority  students. Teachers need to learn about the culture and
language of  their students. Colleges of Education can provide continuing
education activity and courses for those teachers from communities  with
large numbers of minorities.
</p><p>
If we are to prepare a generation of teachers to deal effectively  with
the linguistic and cultural needs of the student population,  there needs
to be a new emphasis on language proficiency in the  undergraduate
curriculum. Currently only ten percent of  baccalaureate degree recipients
are proficient in a language other  than English. As a first step to
increased bilingualism, that  proportion needs to be increased to 50
percent. Further, Colleges of  Education, which seldom require any
language instruction, should  make proficiency in a second language
mandatory for all students,  given the importance of understanding other
cultures, and the need  to relate to the growing changes in our society.
</p><p>
It is never too late for those teachers already in the system to learn  a
new language. In order to increase language proficiency, Colleges  of
Education should create partnerships with the schools that teach
significant numbers of minority students. Through these  arrangements, and
in conjunction with the foreign language  department of the university,
learning opportunities could be  provided in evening courses or during the
summers. The federal  government might target language proficiency as an
important facet  in teacher education and could provide funding as a
stimulus to  improving foreign language skills in the Colleges of
Education.
</p><p>
The federal government should designate the education of minority
teachers a national priority. Despite the growing minority  representation
in America's student population, the number of  minority teachers has
remained relatively stable at about ten  percent during the last ten
years. This means that many of our  children will never have the
opportunity to learn from minority  teaching professionals during their
growing years. As in other  professions, minorities have important
contributions to make to  teaching, based on the unique perspectives,
experience, and  understanding that they may bring to the classroom.
</p><p>
Minority teachers may also serve as needed role models for  minorites and
disadvantaged students from communities in which  the value of education
may not be understood. A shared background  may help a teacher communicate
the importance of learning to  students who otherwise would see little
purpose in attending school.
</p><p>
In order to educate more minority teachers, Colleges of Education  must
recruit outstanding minority students to enter their programs.  Colleges
of Education should establish collaborative efforts with  secondary
schools that have large numbers of minority students. On  a regular basis,
education faculty need to work with the schools to  identify minority
students who have an interest in a teaching career.  Faculty members
should counsel them about a teaching career, and  guide them in their
choice of academic courses. The students should  be advised of the costs
of a university education, and be made aware  of financial aid
opportunities. 
</p><p>
Student visits to the College of Education should be encouraged in  order
that they observe teaching activities and talk to enrolled  students and
faculty about a teaching career.
</p><p>
Universities must make education a priority and recognize that the
preparation of teachers is not just the responsibility of Colleges of
Education, but an integral part of the university mission.  Institutions
of higher education must make a real investment of  attention and
demonstrate a commitment of purpose in teacher  training. In turn, the
federal government should constantly remind  universities of the
importance of preparing teachers, and initiate  programs that support
Colleges of Education.
</p><p>
The challenge in teacher education is clear. We have set far-reaching
national education goals, at a time when our schools are failing to  meet
the needs of an increasingly diverse society. Teaching in the  classroom
of the 1990s demands individuals who can create  effective learning
conditions, and who have developed an  understanding of how to meet the
education needs of a changing  student population. We must not only
restructure our schools, but we  must transform the culture of
professional educators into a culture  of educational renewal that will
produce the teachers we will need  to truly provide quality education for
all children.
</p><p>
Colleges of Education must communicate with the schools about the
transformations taking place that will improve teacher preparation.  They
should encourage and aid the schools to critically review their  teaching
goals, methods, and programs. If needed, the colleges  should provide
expertise that will assist the schools strengthen  their educational
efforts. University-school collaboration is vital if  education in America
is to markedly improve. The federal  government has a role in furthering
this mission by targeting  funding that makes such activities the norm and
not the exception.

<i>"Which Came First" is the fourth of nine pieces of the Enlightenment
Series produced during the 80s when I was attempting to define my
existence in relation to the rest of humanity. The series is composed  of
artist's books that function as little morality stories. The fact  that I
have been in the educational field must have had some  influence. I guess
I continue to give form to complex issues in a  manner that is
nonthreatening while hopefully providing enjoyment  in the process.
Education, whether it be formal or not is, for me,  more about learning
than about teaching. . . . I am very happy to learn  that this country is
trying to redefine the nature of education  through a collaborative
approach. I want to believe that this nation  will consider the role of
art to be as important as that of the other  areas of learning, all of
which grew out of the creative process. That  art is about the skill of
thinking and a respect for feeling. ­ Celia  Alvarez Munoz .</i>
