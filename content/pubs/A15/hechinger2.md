<h2>About Partnership: Breaching the Walls of Academia</h2>

<hr/>
One of the serious obstacles to good teaching is the way new  teachers are
inducted into their workplace: they are dropped into the  classroom,
straight out of their largely theoretical academic  preparation, with
little more than some so-called practice teaching  that gives them
virtually no experience in the real task of teaching.  Worse, they are
expected to take on a full load of classes from Day  One, usually with
little help from experienced colleagues and no  time for reflection. It is
as if medical students were sent into  practice without internship and
residency.
<p>
There they are frightened, exhausted, with little more at their  disposal
than a lot of theories, often outmoded and rarely attuned to  current
efforts at school reform.
</p><p>
The answer to this time-worn practice could readily be borrowed  from the
preparation of physicians or even from the European  concept of
apprenticeship: learning on the job under the guidance of  experienced
practitioners.
</p><p>
Fortunately, a number of colleges and universities have begun to  work
with local schools to create a more professional way for the  transition
from academic teacher preparation to the classroom.  "Horace," the
publication of The Coalition of Essential Schools, in its  September 1993
issue, reports on a growing trend toward  university-school partnerships
aimed at helping new teachers to  find a firm footing in their new
profession.
</p><p>
For example, the University of New Hampshire has created  internships in a
local high school that pay candidates for masters in  education degrees
$3,000 for a year's internship service in the  classroom. As an added
benefit, the particular school happens to be  part of the coalition's
network of schools committed to the latest  educational reforms. This
saves the new teachers from the more  usual fate of being pressed into the
mold of outmoded ways to which  too many schools still subscribe.
</p><p>
"We want to do teacher education <i>only</i> in schools that are in the
process of restructuring," said Lynne Miller, a professor of education  at
the University of Southern Maine which is working with a network  of
nearby schools.
</p><p>
Theodore Sizer, the coalition's chairman, underscores this view: "You
just can't talk about teacher education apart from school reform."
</p><p>
Like all university-school collaboration, the internship concept
represents a two-way approach to reform: the schools and their  potential
teachers benefit from the arrangement; at the same time,  the university
and its teacher training sector learn from the  feedback brought to them
by their masters degree candidates' or  former students' classroom
experience.
</p><p>
Unless the universities are deaf to the message of what reformed  schools
need, they will update their teacher training curriculum.  This could do
wonders for the improvement, or even the elimination,  of many of those
required education courses which have long been  the butt of criticism and
ridicule.
</p><p>
In the traditional hierarchy of academia, universities usually  determine
what is important and what should be researched and  taught, without
paying much attention to what is important to the  practitioners in the
field. In a university-school partnership, the  two establish goals and
priorities together.
</p><p>
The idea of the two-way street of collaboration is hardly news to  Yale
professors who have taken part in the Yale-New Haven Teacher  Institute.
</p><p>
If planned in close partnership between the schools and the  university,
the teacher training faculty will become a vital part of  the schools
where their interns teach. This could be a step toward  eliminating the
gap and the mutual suspicions between the two  professions: the education
faculty and the practitioners in the  schools. If the system works, the
two sides will emerge as partners  in the same enterprise, working
together and helping each other in  the interest of better education. As
the Yale experience has shown,  school teachers and university professors
learn to view each other  as colleagues.
</p><p>
Will the partnership and the internship idea replace the old, usually
inadequate, student teaching component of teacher training and put  an end
to the "swim or sink" induction of new teachers? Probably not  rapidly
enough. Established turf is not readily abandoned. Academic  walls are not
easily demolished. Yet, Kathleen Cushman, author of  the report in
"Horace," lists a number of universities that have  established
collaboration with schools, including Indiana State  University, the
universities of New Mexico, Hartford, Louisville, and  Florida
International University.
</p><p>
Betty Lou Whitford, of the University of Louisville, puts it bluntly:
"We're all in the same business not just to help schools, not just to
educate teachers, but to collaborate in the education of children. Our
goal is to blur the lines so that it will be hard to tell whether I'm a
'university person' or a 'school person'."
</p><p>
It won't happen overnight, but the direction is right.
