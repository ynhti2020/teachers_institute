<h2>
Business Education: Crossing the Divide</h2>

Not too long ago, I came across a bit of trivia in the newspaper about
shoes.  It seems that it's only been 200 years since shoemakers  began
fabricating a different shoe for the right and left foot.  Prior  to then,
both shoes were exactly the same.  In hindsight, one  wonders why it took
so long to happen.
<p>
As I look at the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, I have the same
feeling.  The idea of college faculty working with high school and  middle
school teachers to enrich all parties and to develop  curriculum units for
the schools seems self-evident.  The Institute  has moved quickly in the
last ten years from a tentative experiment  in collaboration to a
nationally recognized model for  university/college relations with public
schools across the country.   The model works so well we wonder why it
took so long.
</p><p>
As a businessman, I'm somewhat envious of how smoothly that  effort got
off the ground.  Collaboration between business and the  public schools
has taken place for decades, but seldom leads to an  institutionalized
long term relationship.  There are several reasons  for this, but perhaps
the most fundamental is that many  businessmen and educators have
different perspectives on what  education is about.  This frequently leads
to entrenched attitudes  that make long-term relationships difficult.
Occasionally an  enlightened businessman and school superintendent can
make things  happen, but when one or both of them move on, the
collaboration  weakens or ceases.
</p><p>
What is frustrating about this situation is that both sides need to
support one another in order to survive as healthy, productive
institutions.  The economy of this country and the survival of its
industries are directly linked to the knowledge and skills of our  people,
and this is increasingly so as we compete around the world.   We depend on
our schools to provide a competitive workforce in a  global economy.  By
the same token, public and private financial  support of schools ebbs and
flows with the country's economic  situation.  School budgets take a
beating when the economy is bad  and people are out of work.
</p><p>
Adult life is not easy, and for some it is a nightmare.  There are  many
reasons why some succeed and others fail, but one of the key  ingredients
for a useful life is a basic education.  Yet one out of  every four
children who start kindergarten in Connecticut does not  complete high
school.  Almost an equal number graduate without  marketable job skills.
These figures translate into frustration,  unemployment, wasted lives and
crime.  The inability to read or  write, to compute, to think logically
and make decisions, is a  handicap few can overcome.  Education, or the
lack of it, can make or  break most lives.
</p><p>
Knowledge, skills and attitudes are the tools needed to function
effectively as citizen, parent, neighbor, worker.  The critical
questions, however, are: "How much knowledge?" "About what?"  "What kind
of skills?" "How specialized?" "What attitudes?" "How to  teach them?" It
is in this arena, where we try to define the  specifics of public school
education, that sharp differences of  opinion often exist between business
and education.
</p><p>
There are business people, I'm sure, who feel that knowledge of art,
music, geography and history is a waste of time and does not  contribute
to one of the first needs of a young adult足finding and  retaining a
job.  That attitude is a pity.  There are also teachers, I'm  sure, who
feel there is no reason for the schools to prepare young  people for the
workplace足how to dress, how to sell yourself, how to  present your
strong points and interests.  Tha attitude is also a pity.   Business
people often weigh schools against a single standard足how  well they
prepare young people for work.  That standard is  inadequate.  Educators
on the other hand often evaluate their product  as though work did not
exist.  That standard is also inadequate.
</p><p>
School is more than academics.  It is a process of growth, of young
people maturing into adults who know themselves, their likes and
dislikes, interests and aptitudes.  It should include learning the
difference between long-term and short-term goals, weighing  alternatives
and making decisions against those goals.  It begs an  understanding of
our economy, how it works, what the job market is  like and what
preparation is needed to play a role in it.  All of these  things can be
taught in school and should be taught in school, and I  happen to believe
that business can assist greatly in this area.
</p><p>
Just as important, a business-school collaboration can help to  strengthen
the content of certain courses and to enrich the  development of teachers.
Computer labs, laser research, cutting- edge manufacturing techniques are
a few of the business  applications of math and science that could turn on
the gifted  youngster and rekindle the marginal student.  Summer
internships  for teachers, carefully planned and with long-term
commitment,  could add a dimension to teaching not found in the textbooks.
</p><p>
It seems a natural linkage, and sometimes it happens.  It simply  doesn't
happen enough, and it doesn't become institutionalized, or  take on a life
of its own.  Both sides settle for business gifts of  used computers and
shop equipment, along with business advisory  boards that seldom make a
difference.  The fault lies with both  parties and centers around
entrenched attitudes that are  understandable but are ultimately self
defeating.  We have  differences and we need to examine these differences
through  dialogue.  Let it be blunt, honest, critical, but let it take
place.  I  hope that this article continues the dialogue and action needed
to  move this issue into a more public forum.  The more educators and
businessmen talk, the more we will see that we have something very
important in common足we both want young people to learn and to
succeed in life.
