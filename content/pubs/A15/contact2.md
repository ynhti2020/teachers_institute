The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is an educational partnership
between Yale University and the New Haven Public Schools designed to
strengthen teaching and learning in local schools and, by example, in
schools across the country.  Through the Institute, teachers from the
University and the Schools work together in a collegial relationship.
Founded in 1978, the Institute is the first program of its type to be
established permanently.
