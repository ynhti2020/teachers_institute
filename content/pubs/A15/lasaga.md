Collaboration and Technology</h2>

At the same time as the collaboration between universities and  schools
intensifies across the country, telecommunications is  fundamentally
transforming the manner in which the collaboration is  pursued. The field
of electronic communication has already begun to  play a dominant role in
the exchange of ideas and data. Local links  (e.g. ordinary cables, a fax,
or a modem) between similar computers  have usually enabled the transfer
of information or the sharing of  software and printers. However, the need
for a much more powerful  global link between local networks led to the
development of  "Internet," which is a network of networks using a
standard  communication protocol called TCP/IP. In a sense, the "Internet"
provides an information superhighway that links the smaller roads  built
from the simple local networks. 
<p>
The first Internet, ARPANET, arose from research supported by the
department of defense. Today, the US government spends billions of
dollars a year to provide the satellite and cable coverage needed to
physically link computers around the nation and the world. In  particular,
NSFNET (National Science Foundation Network) provides  the major backbone
connecting universities and colleges around the  nation. Today, the
Internet is a huge world-wide network of  networks comprising thousands of
networks interconnecting more  than 500,000 computers ranging from the
smallest PC to the most  powerful computers on earth. This information
superhighway is now  travelled by more than 15 million people and is truly
turning the  world into a "global village."
</p><p>
The electronic superhighway is becoming an essential element in
catalyzing the collaboration between universities and schools. The
possibilities in this domain are just now being explored and the  current
activity is but a shadow of what is to come. Already, there  are tens of
thousands of elementary school students around the  world engaging in
global communication through the Internet. Even  the White House is
accessible to the students via the Internet and  President Clinton has
already sent some replies to students. Armed  with even the humblest of
computers, the students and teachers can  communicate across the planet
and share in a virtually unlimited  wealth of resources.
</p><p>
An example of a vibrant forum using electronic communications is  the
KIDLINK network. KIDLINK has been in operation for several  years. During
1991 and 1992, KIDLINK had 6200 children from 45  countries participate in
a global dialogue. Students can communicate  with each other using KIDCAFE
and teachers can discuss projects in  KIDPROJ. The students answer four
questions about themselves to  enter the system: 1) Who am I?  2) What do
I want to be when I grow  up?  3) How do I want the world to be better
when I grow up?  and 4)  What can I do now to make this happen? In fact,
recent studies have  analyzed the responses according to gender and found
some  interesting conclusions. The global chats can introduce many
different cultures and languages to these kids in the global village,  in
addition to providing new friends. Teleconferencing can be  achieved
through IRC hookups. IRC (Internet Relay Chats) can link  many students
and their teachers into a live global exchange on any  topic. For example,
such IRC's have taken place during the launching  of several of NASA's
Explorer missions. KIDLINK enables the  discussion of current topics with
many different countries. In some  cases, the discussion is occurring
before the newsmedia can cover  the issue. 
</p><p>
For example, the historic trek through Antarctica carried out earlier
this year by Sir Rannulph Fiennes and Dr. Michael Stroud o raise  funds
for multiple sclerosis was followed closely in KIDLINK with  the help of
Ham Radio operator Peter Daly, who was in  communication with the
Antarctic team and then relayed the  messages on KIDLINK. The team set a
record for the unaided crossing  of the Antarctic continent. Current
projects on KIDLINK include a  discussion of war and peace in the world
today; a global discussion  group on children's rights focusing on UNICEF;
Environment 2093,  which asks the students to imagine the world 100 years
from now  and to write about it, including a discussion of pollution; a
travel  project in which students first describe their area and plan a
3-day  visit for guests their own age and then go on to carry out a
virtual  trip to other places in the world with the help of students from
those areas (which involves further dialogue between the students  and
teachers); use of daily satellite pictures of the world (which can  be
downloaded free of charge) to carry out weather forecasting.
</p><p>
Because professors and school teachers can be in constant  communication
using the network, the possibility of jointly  discussing particular
projects is significantly enhanced including  discussions between
"experts" on one continent and teachers on  another. The access to huge
databases, pictures from all around the  world (including the exchange of
scanned pictures of the students  themselves), and educational software as
well as the ability to talk  to new friends can help transform the
classroom into an exciting  place. University faculty can help in
formulating the various  projects, suggesting contacts, analyzing the
data, and preparing  reports. Computers can also be used in the
visualization of data and  in simulations of the real world. The
development of new curricula  by teachers can be enormously aided by tips
and suggestions from  other teachers around the world. Just now, there are
proposals to  establish user groups within KIDLINK for teachers in
specific  subject areas including the creation of a network of people who
can  serve as contacts.
</p><p>
As exciting and promising as the use of high technology in the  classroom
is, there are serious problems to overcome before the  huge potential
comes to fruition. The number of ways of using  Internet and computers in
enlarging the classroom can be quite  overwhelming to many teachers. In
addition, teachers often lack the  computer skills needed to use important
operations such as ftp (file  transfer protocol) and telnet. Therefore,
the various options  available to teachers must be clearly explained and
there have to be  some instructions on the use of computers that do not
assume any  computer literacy. Teachers must feel comfortable with the use
of  the network before they can effectively pass that information to the
students (students will pick up the techniques quite fast!). This is a
particularly important area for future collaboration between  university
and schools. 
</p><p>
Full access to the Internet is still a major problem in applying the  high
technology to classrooms around the world. Universities, which  in many
cases provide the only access to the Internet for schools,  again can play
an important active role in the introduction of  telecommunications to
future generations. In addition, access to the  Internet requires a PC and
a modem in the classrooms as well as an  account on a university computer.
Unfortunately, many schools lack  the resources to provide even the PC's
in the classroom. In some  instances, there are computer resources in the
school but the usage  of the computers is quite constrained. This is
another important  area for collaboration between the university faculty
and schools.
</p><p>
As we look to the coming of a new millennium, the traffic through  the
electronic superhighway will change dramatically.  Just as real  highways
promote the growth of cities, the electronic superhighway  will promote
the growth of academic endeavors, and in particular  the teaching of
students in the K-12 grades of our schools. The  choices are so numerous
and the possibilities so great that the  challenge for us in the future is
to chart an optimal path not only to  provide adequate access of our
children and teachers to this  wonderful high technology, bu also to
collaborate on developing the  most efficient use of telecommunications to
enhance the  understanding of history, geography, science, environment,
politics,  cultures, and most importantly the students' views of
themselves  and their world.
