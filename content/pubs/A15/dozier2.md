<h2>
The 1993 Goals 2000 Teacher Forum: Lessons Learned</h2>
<p><font size="+1">by Therese K. Dozier</font>
</p></center>
<hr/>
Reaching the National Education Goals and helping all students strive  for
high academic standards will take unprecedented partnerships.
Key partners in our states and communities have to be classroom  teachers.
Teachers must help lead the charge.  By appointing me as  the first
resident teacher-advisor at the Education Department,  Secretary Riley
signaled that teachers will be a significant part of  the Clinton
Administration's process of educational reform.
<p>
<i>But I can't do it alone.</i>
</p><p>
That's why last November the U.  S.  Department of Education invited  a
group of 119 exceptional public and private school teachers to  Washington
to hear their thoughts and to explore ways that the  federal government
can work with educators to make sure our  thinking was in touch with the
classroom.  I'm pleased to report that  this event, the Goals 2000 Teacher
Forum, was a great success.
</p><p>
While in Washington, these outstanding teachers demonstrated that  they
have much to contribute-beyond their work in their individual
classrooms-to improving education in this country.  The participants  had
a lot to tell us about how we, as a nation, need to rethink our
educational system.
</p><p>
The department wants these and other teachers like them to be  agents of
change.  These teachers agreed that if we are going to help  all kids
reach high standards, first we are going to have to change  the way the
education system does business.  At the close of the  forum, we asked
teachers for recommendations on how the system  should change.  They said:
</p><ul>
<li>Teachers must be included in any decision-making process that  affects
them and their students.
</li><li>The education system must be reshaped from that of a factory  model to
one that reflects high-level thinking, academic rigor, and  the skills
necessary to make our students competitive in this fast- changing world.
</li><li>Policymakers at all levels must ensure adequate, equitable and  stable
funding for educationTeachers must be given adequate time during their day
to allow  them to be professional educators.
</li><li>Teacher preparation programs and staff development must be  overhauled
to adequately meet the needs of today's students.
</li></ul>
One of the messages that came through loud and clear was that  teachers
need more <i>time.</i>  Time to become more competent  professionals and
to become active in school reform.  Time to plan  effective lessons that
actively engage students.  Time to assess  students in meaningful ways.
Time to talk with and listen on a  personal level to students, many of
whom have no support system  outside of school.
<p>
In short, teachers need time to be professional educators.
</p><p>
The forum participants also expressed their belief that universities  and
colleges must play an integral role in ensuring that we have
professional, highly competent teachers in our classrooms.   However,
there was also a strong consensus on the need to overhaul  teacher
preparation and staff development programs.  They said they  believe
teachers should work collaboratively with higher education  faculty to
plan curricula and powerful clinical experiences for  preservice teachers
and to help shape ongoing professional  development experiences.  
</p><p>
Higher education's commitment to teacher development should nt end  with
preservice training but should be sustained throughout a  teacher's entire
career.  Because the nature of teaching is changing,  teachers are
beginning to see themselves as mentors and  facilitators, rather than
disseminators of facts.  And as one teacher  observed, "Teaching as a
mentor is definitely more difficult and  requires vast staff development."
</p><p>
As another teacher stated, "Professional development is a process,  not an
event."
</p><p>
At the Department of Education, we hope the formal report of what  the
forum teachers had to say will enable teachers to participate in  and
contribute to the policy-making process at every level.  If we  hope to be
successful in our efforts, we must honor what teachers  know and listen to
what they say.
