Teachers and Teaching, excerpts</h2>

<i>In a lecture in 1985 to the Education Writers Association, Edward J.
Meade, Jr., offered a look back over the previous three decades of
teaching in America and a view ahead over the next decade. As that  decade
now draws to a close, Meade's comments on teacher  preparation and on
school university partnerships remain as  important as when he made them.
He said in part:
</i>
<p>
"Two basic assumptions undergird my remarks. One is very simple:  Teachers
have been and will continue to be central to education in  schools. I
think the recent spate of reports about schools, however  many you wish to
count, and regardless of their specific  recommendations, acknowledge the
centrality of the teacher as the  key to improvements we're going to make
in schools. The second is  related; namely, that changes in curriculum,
more knowledge about  learning, and the increased use of technology for
teaching and  learning also will underscore again the importance of the
teacher.
</p><p>
"Recently, I was asked by the National Commission on Excellence in
Teacher Education to examine many of the reports about schools and  see
what they said about teacher education. . . . There was very little  in
them about teacher education in any direct sense. So, I examined  what
they said about teachers, what they assumed teachers to be  like, to learn
whether in some collective sense I could find that  information and relate
it to teacher education. . . . 
</p><p>
"In summary, my analysis of the reports revealed eight factors  related to
teachers: (1) a teacher is, first, a well-educated person;  (2) he or she
ought to be an intellectually curious person; (3) he or  she should have
mastered the knowledge about the subject or  subjects he or she is
expected to teach; (4) a teacher ought to be  knowledgeable about the
American society: its history, its political,  economic and social
systems, and about the place and role of  education in it; (5) a teacher
should know about children­how they  develop, how they learn, and the
contexts in which they live; (6) a  teacher should 'coach' or 'manage'
learning and be a decision-maker  in the pedagogical sense; (7) a teacher
should be a continuous  learner; and, finally, (8) a teacher should be
able to have a career in  teaching, one that is varied and rewarding. 
</p><p>
"Currently, there is much ferment about the preparation of new  teachers
for the schools. . . . Clearly, we will need teachers who  know what is
needed to be known and learned, who will know  students and how to help
them learn, and, therefore, who will be  able to teach effectively. 
</p><p>
"At the very least, the colleges and universities that prepare  teachers
will need to view the preparation of teachers as a priority  and use all
their best intellectual and professional resources to do  so, and not rely
only on those in their education departments. Also,  schools and school
systems will need to be more actively engaged  with higher education in
the preparation of new teachers. No longer  should schools take their
share of responsibility in this regard in a  casual fashion. If clinical
training is essential to preparing  teachers, a I believe it is, then the
schools need to be more formally  arranged and prepared to be a partner
(perhaps the dominant partner)  in this aspect of teacher preparation. We
will need arrangements in  the schools that foster clinical training, and
we will need teachers  in the schools who have the capacity and the time,
and the support,  to work with those being trained to teach. 
</p><p>
"Further, once a person is inducted into teaching . . . the
responsibility of college or university is not finished as is currently
the case in most instances. Higher education, as much as the  schools, has
a responsibility to nurture those beginners so that they  will continue to
grow academically and intellectually as well as  pedagogically. After all,
school teachers and college professors are,  in many ways, engaged in the
same business. They are peers, and the  collaboration of both­during
teacher preparation and after it­ought  to strengthen both schools
and colleges. 
</p><p>
"Where does this all lead to for teacher preparation? Does it lead  again
to the M.A.T.? Perhaps. Does it lead to teacher preparation  taking
longer? I think so. I don't see how we can meet the demands  for academic,
intellectual and professional competency along with  those for solid
clinical training in just four years. After all, we now  assume that four
years of education in the liberal arts is the  minimum for someone to be
'well-educated.' Teachers for America's  future need to be that and more,
much more. They need to be the best  we can find­as well-educated as
any first-rate college graduate  who has a sensible 'mix' of knowledge of
content­the real and  fundamental stuff of the fields in which they
will teach­along with  that knowledge which undergirds a teacher's
craft, and with clinical  training on a par with the best now offered by
other humanserving  professions. 
</p><p>
"Still, all of this kind of preparation will be of little consequence
unless the schools in which these new teachers teach are,  themselves,
places that are stimulating and arranged for learning­ not only for
students, but also for teachers. Clearly, one aspect of  that is more
intellectual or academic autonomy for teachers. The  fact that many
teachers are not allowed to participate in the  selection of instructional
materials for the students they are  expected to teach is wrong, plain
wrong. The fact that many teachers  are restrained in how they teach by
having to conform to  prescribed­no, mandated­styles of teaching
wrought by excessively  rigid curricula is wrong, just wrong. The fact
that accountability by  teachers has become more important than trust in
teachers is  wrong, just wrong. We need teachers in schools where there
are  opportunities to grow, to have a career, and to be rewarded
accordingly as teachers who continue to teach, rather than having  them
seek growth and reward by leaving teaching. 
</p><p>
"For this society to find such a talent for teaching, to educate and
train it for teaching, and to allow it to properly serve the children  and
adolescents in our schools is no small task. It will require a new
vision, a new understanding, and a new commitment by all of us."
