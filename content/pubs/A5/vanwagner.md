It is the purpose of this unit to acquaint the student with the intriguing
world of crystals, their structure, formation, and uses. 
<p>
Most students when confronted with a well-formed quartz crystal, or a
purple fluorite, or a polished geode, literally jump about demanding to
know “Who made this?” and “How did they make this?” and the subject of
diamonds and other gems is avariciously at tended to with wide eyes and
listening ears. Since the actual atomic structure can be drawn and modeled
in a wide variety of mediums even the more humdrum aspects can be made
inviting. And the chemical concoctions that can result in some homemade
crystals
bring out the white-coat scientist in even the most reluctant student.
Many of the students own small personal calculators that are
solar-powered, or have seen the advertisements in discount store circulars
for solar powered exterior lighting. These obje cts provide a good
jump-off point for discussions about crystals and technology.</p><p>
My unit on crystals will be divided into three categories covering three
areas of study. The first area will deal with the actual structure of
crystals beginning with a look at the atom, some simple atomic drawings
(Bohr models) of elements, and a study o f the periodic table of the
elements. Next we will look at compounds and their bonds. This will lead
to the understanding of how crystals “look” and the shapes they can take.
Within this section we will draw and construct in three dimensions paper
models of six of the basic crystal shapes. We will also grow some of our
own crystals in the laboratory.</p><p>
The second major heading in my unit will focus on minerals. We will learn
about the characteristics of a mineral: the chemical composition, mineral
color, luster, cleavage, hardness (and how this property is related to
crystal structure), and specific gra vity. The characteristics of minerals
lend themselves nicely to a mineral identification lab, and a lab on
specific gravity of minerals and selected rock samples. Some of the other
topics in this section will include a study of the various forms of quartz
; gems, especially diamonds; the formation of mineral crystals—by igneous,
sedimentary, and metamorphic processes; and some stories of famous (or
infamous) gems.</p><p>
The final section of this unit will delve into the uses for crystals which
modern technology has fostered, specifically solar cells, transistors, and
liquid crystals.</p><p>
The unit is designed for the middle school age level, specifically for the
eighth grade Earth Science curriculum. In the two years that I have used
this curriculum unit with my eighth grade classes I have amplified or
omitted sections depending on the int erest and abilities of the various
classes. In this way I have been able to use the unit with students that
range in ability from very high to very low.</p><p>

<h3>I. Atoms, Elements, and Compounds</h3>
The building blocks of all things are the tiny atoms that make up the many
elements which we can see on the periodic table. The minerals we will be
studying are made of these elements or combinations of elements called
compounds. The basic atom is compose d of positively-charged protons,
negatively-charged electrons, and neutrons, which have no electrical
charge at all. Protons and neutrons are located in the nucleus of a cell
and have almost the same mass which is measured by a special unit called
the ato mic mass unit, or amu. A single proton or a single neutron has a
mass of about one amu. The electron has a much smaller mass, only 1/1836
amu. There are always the same number of protons as electrons, and
therefore the same number of positive charges as n egative charges are
found in the neutral atom. 
<h4>A. The Bohr Model</h4>
Although our best understanding of the atom tells us that the electrons
are in constant and rapid motion around the nucleus and the exact location
of any electron cannot be known, we can by experimental means determine
the most probable locations of elect rons and establish energy levels or
shells which we can use to help us understand the relations of atoms. In
1913 a Danish scientist, Niels Bohr, developed a model that can be used by
children to understand the way atoms combine into compounds. This model
is called the Bohr model and shows a central nucleus with the protons and
neutrons either drawn in or simply enumerated. Around this central core
are the shells or energy levels. These levels are sometimes referred to as
the K, L, M, N, O shells or alter natively, the first, second, third,
fourth, fifth, energy levels. Each of these levels has a specific number
of electrons it can maximally hold. The degree to which these shells are
filled determines how readily it will combine with other elements and in
what proportion. 
Figure 1 illustrates a specific labelling technique that is quite easy to
use with children and facilitates accuracy. Since the shells fill using
definite laws and patterns involving energy, they are predictable. Beyond
the element calcium, however, the l aws become quite complex and need
extensive explanation and understanding of subshells. It is wise,
therefore, to limit the Bohr model drawing to that point at this grade
level. Some periodic tables give the number of electrons in the energy
levels as par t of the information in the block for each element. By
looking at this data, some of the students might come up with partial
explanations for the building of these shells. In the absence of such data
it is sufficient to declare the numbers 2 and 8 “magic numbers” and let
them build the smaller atoms.<p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
(where p stands for proton number, e stands for electron number, n stands for neutron number, and K and L represent the first two electron energy levels.)</p>
<p>
After drawing out a few, or many, of the Bohr models the children will
notice that some of the models have an outer shell that only needs one or
two more electrons to be filled, and that others have one or two electrons
that seem to hang awkwardly by them selves in their outer shell. These
conditions can of course be used to develop an understanding of the terms
metal and nonmetal. Since the children can “see” the electrons they can
judge their availability for donating or receiving. This technique makes e
asy work of explaining compounds and their chemical formulas. It also aids
in the explanation of ionic and covalent bonding.</p>
<h4>B. Ionic Bonding</h4>
By drawing a Bohr model of sodium we can see that its K and L shells are
filled and the one remaining electron is by itself in the outer M shell.
It will take very little energy to coax that electron away from its atom,
leaving only ten electrons with ten
negative charges to balance with the eleven protons with their eleven
positive charges. When this happens we will have an ion with a +1 charge. 
In the same way if we draw a shell that has seven electrons, one short of
that “magic number” eight. In this c ase the chlorine atom would be very
happy (anthropomorphically speaking) to grab another electron and fill
that shell. In doing so the chlorine atom now would have seventeen protons
and eighteen electrons, resulting in a net charge on the atom of -1. This
would be a negative ion. When two elements come together in this way we
refer to it as an ionic bond. The opposing charges on the two ions cause
them to be attracted together. 
<p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p>
<h4>C. Covalent Bonding</h4>
Next we will draw out an oxygen atom. In this case we can see that its
outer shell has six electrons, two short of the “magic number” eight. And
if we draw a hydrogen atom we can see that it has one electron in its
outer shell, half of what it needs to fu lfill the “magic” two count. From
this we could deduce that by bringing in another hydrogen atom we can
combine the three atoms into H2O, and each atom’s outermost shell would be
filled. This is the basis for an understanding of covalent bonds, in which
a toms come together and share electrons in their outer shells. The
electron clouds overlap and the electrons circle both atoms. 
<p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
The bonds of compounds can influence some substances physical properties.
And bonds exist not just between individual atoms but also throughout a
crystal. We can look at two forms of the element carbon for an example.
Graphite is a slippery black solid, t he bonds form sheets of carbon which
slide loosely over one another. Diamond on the other hand is a hard, clear
crystal with tight tetrahedral bonding that holds the carbon atoms of
diamonds securely in place. The difference can be seen below in the illus
tration.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Further investigation of the importance of chemical bonds can be
accomplished by a study of sugar and salt crystals. By comparing melting
points and ease of crushing some simple inferences can be made about their
bonds. Directions for this experiment are to be found in Appendix 1,
Activity 1.</p>

<h3>II. Crystals and Crystal Systems</h3>
<h4>A. Unit Cells</h4>
When atoms or molecules are lined up in an orderly arrangement and
connected by bonds, and these atoms or molecules have a repeating pattern,
we can then say this material is a crystalline substance. The smallest
subdivison of a crystal is a unit cell. It
is a regular pattern of atoms held together by electrical forces or
bonds. These unit cells are far too minute to be seen individually but can
be combined together in incredibly large numbers to form visible shapes.
As an example of the staggeringly larg e numbers of unit cells we are
talking about we can take as an example sodium chloride, table salt. One
typical salt grain has about 5.6 x 1018 unit cells. (Each salt unit cell
is composed of four atoms of sodium and four atoms of chlorine.)1
<h4>B. Crystal Systems</h4>
When the unit cells group together they leave no empty spaces between
themselves. This results in a limited number of crystal systems that can
form. These systems can be grouped as follows:2
<dl><dt>1.Isometric or cubic—three edges of equal length and at right
angles to one another.
</dt><dt>2.Tetragonal—three edges at right angles but only two edges of equal length.
</dt><dt>3.Orthorhombic—three edges at right angles but all edges of different lengths.
</dt><dt>4.Monoclinic—two edges at right angle, the other angle not; and all edges of different lengths.
</dt><dt>5.Triclinic—all three edges of different lengths and all angles not at right angles.
</dt><dt>6.Hexagonal—two edges are equal and make angles of 60 to 120 degrees
with each other. The third edge is at right angles to them and of different length.
</dt></dl>
Two activities which can be used with the students are to be found in
Appendix 1 listed within Activity 2. The first is a simple introduction to
the various crystal shapes by drawing them and identifying their title.
The second activity applicable to crys tal shapes using the diagrams given
there. In doing so, the student can in very concrete terms understand the
variety of angles and lengths involved.
<h4>C. Growing Crystals</h4>
Once the student has a basic understanding of what a crystal is, he or she
is often anxious to create some crystals of his or her own. This provides
a natural opportunity to introduce some new terms which they will use in
their laboratory experiences. <p> Since most of their crystals will be
formed by solution the student needs to add the words <i>solute,
solvent,</i> and
<i>solution</i> to his vocabulary. The solute is the substance being
dissolved
and the solvent is the substance doing the dissolving. A solvent can ho ld
in solution just so much of the solute. At this point we say the solution
is saturated. If there is less solute in the solution than it would
ideally hold we would then say it is an unsaturated solution. And in some
cases such as when we heat the solve nt we can continue to add solute and
it will dissolve. When the heat source is removed and the solution’s
temperature falls the extra solute may remain in solution. This fragile
situation is called supersaturation and is the basis for our crystal
growth experiments.</p><p>
<i>Solubility,</i> or the amount of solute which can be dissolved in the
solvent,
is affected by a number of factors, one of which is the temperature of the
solvent. Generally speaking we increase solubility of solid solute when we
increase the temperature of the solvent. (This is not true of the
solubility of gases in a solvent as is witnessed by anyone who has sipped
a glass of warm, flat soda.) In Appendix 2 there are some solubility
figures which the student can use to set up graphs of solubility
curves.</p><p>
Crystal growth is a very orderly and regulated process. A crystal grows
from the southside with the atoms of the compound being added according to
a very specific pattern. If there is not enough space for the crystal to
grow unhindered it will increase on ly until it meets something which gets
in its way and then stop. Often many small crystals begin forming at the
same time, and they grow until their edges meet at varying angles. They do
not join to form a single large crystal but rather remain a jumble of
small individual crystals forming a <i>polycrystalline mass.</i> The
adjoining
faces of the crystals are called the <i>grain boundaries.</i> These
boundaries
are particularly evident in metals which have formed by fairly rapid
cooling of the molten form. During the c ooling process innumerable small
crystals form and grow until they bump into a neighboring crystal.</p><p>
Crystals can form from the cooling or evaporation of solutions, or from
the cooling of molten solid, or the cooling of vaporized substances. In
Appendix 3 you will find a number of experimental techniques for
demonstrating crystal growth and for student p articipation in crystal
growing.</p>
<h4>D. Impurities3</h4>
While the regularity and order of crystals have been stressed thus far, it
is important to note that this order can be disturbed. Generally the cause
is the inclusion of an impurity. Sometimes this is the result of a crystal
forming around a foreign parti cle. This can usually be detected by
microscopic examination. But other times it is actually an invasion by an
atom with approximately the same size and shape as the host crystal, and
the pattern is not disrupted. This is called a mixed crystal. The class ic
example of this is alum which is composed of potassium sulfate and
aluminum sulfate in a one to one proportion. A similar compound is chrome
alum, in which you find potassium sulfate combined with chromium sulfate. 
<p>
Many crystals in nature demonstrate this mixed crystal condition in the
replacement of aluminum by chromium or sometimes iron. Rubies are a good
example of this, being composed of aluminum oxide with chromium replacing
some of the aluminum, and also sapph ires which replace the aluminum with
titanium and iron.</p><p>
In some cases a slightly different atomic substance can enter a crystal
but only in small quantities. This is called a substitutional impurity. A
most relevant example of this is substitution of phosphorus or boron atoms
in silicon crystals. These “impure ” compounds are used to make
transistors for electronic instruments.</p><p>
Sometimes a different kind of impurity enters a crystal. These foreign
atoms may be very small compared to the host substance and fit in between
the orderly arranged host atoms. If the host substance has a generous size
pattern the invading atoms could be
as large as the host atoms themselves. The additional atoms are called
interstitial impurities. A well known example of this is carbon and iron,
which makes steel.</p><p>
A third kind of defect could be called a vacancy. This results from very
rapid crystal growth during which some of the atomic sites are simply not
filled. The milky or veiled appearance of home-grown crystals, however, is
caused by very large openings called voids. It generally occurs when the
evaporation of solvent proceeds too rapidly and incomplete crystallization
happens. The white coloration is caused by the presence of a liquid
solution that is trapped in the open spaces of the crystal. Vacancies on
the other hand are far too small to be visible.</p><p>

<h3>III. Minerals</h3>
<h4>A. Definitions</h4>
What is a mineral? What makes it unique? These are questions that can be
used to open up the subject to the student. They will often confuse the
term with “rock” or think only of the more valuable forms such as rubies
or diamonds. They may also want to in clude coal because they have heard
it called a mineral resource, or pearls since they seem to fit in with the
other gems. So a discussion of just what a mineral is would be in order. 
<p>
Minerals are natural substances that are inorganic and not the result of
any living process, therefore ruling out coal, oil, or pearls. It must
also have a specific chemical formula, made up of atoms in a definite
ratio. In addition the atoms must have a definite and specific arrangement
in space. It is because of these characteristics that minerals have unique
properties which can be used to differentiate them from one another.</p>
<h4>B. Terms of Identification</h4>
Some of a mineral’s properties are easily determined by simple visual
examination: crystal shape, color, and luster. The beginning student will
generally try to identify a mineral by its color first. In the case of
some minerals this may be successful—mal acite is always green, zaurite is
always blue, etc. But for most minerals the surface color can vary
tremendously depending on impurities included in the crystal structure.<p>
Many minerals are made up primarily of elements which impart no strong
color of their own and only minute amounts of a coloring agent can have
striking results. Some color guidelines are: red may indicate the presence
of chromium or hematite, green can in dicate chlorite or chromium, and
blue can indicate the presence of titanium or titanium and iron. The
presence of copper ions can result in shades of green or blue and
manganese can result in shades of red. It is sometimes helpful to
determine the color of a mineral’s streak by rubbing the sample on an
unglazed porcelain streak plate. This powdered residue is often more
accurate in indicating true color and many mineral identification
handbooks include a list of streak colors.</p><p>
Hardness of a mineral is shown by its resistance to being scratched. This
is related to the crystal structure in that the more tightly bonded the
atoms the harder the surface resistance to being etched will be. Diamond
is the hardest mineral but is not re adily available for student
experimentation. Corundum is the next step down and it inexpensively
available. In 1812 Friedrich Mohs devised a rough scale of hardness that
is invaluable in mineral identification. Diamond at number 10 is the
hardest, and tal c at number 1 is the softest. The intervals between the
numbers are not equal, however, and the difference between corundum at 9
and diamond at 10 is greater than the entire range of 1 to 9!</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>

</td></tr></tbody></table>
<i>Cleavage</i> is a reflection of the electrical forces acting between
the atoms which result in the crystal breaking along atomic planes that
are parallel to crystal faces. The children are asked to look for these
flat faces and simply to indicate whether the mineral has “good” cleavage
or instead breaks with rather raggedy edges and is therefore declared to
be fractured. Or if the student has already looked at crystal shape
pictures and constructed paper models of them, they can try naming the
crystal system it belongs to.</p><p>
<i>Luster</i> is that mineral property which indicates the way light is
reflected from the surface of the sample. Some luster terms are: glassy,
metallic, greasy, pearly, or satin-like. These are all terms the students
are familiar with and can also be used in c onjunction with an
identification manual.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Another means of identifying minerals is <i>specific gravity.</i> This
measurement can be the most helpful identifying characteristic of all as
it is apt to be the most reliable. The students can have a very
interesting lab built around this property. Directions
for this lab are in Appendix 1, Activity 4.</p><p>
The story of Archimedes and his quest for a way to determine the value of
the king’s crown is a sure-fire attention-getter to start the lesson.
According to the legend, in about 250 B.C. Archimedes was given the task
of determining if a crown belonging to
King Hiero was pure gold or only an alloy of gold and silver. It is said
that upon easing into his tub the bath water spilled over the edge and it
came to him that the volume of water lost was the same as the volume of
his body, and he could use the same
technique to determine the volume of the crown. Since it was known that
gold and silver have different densities, the only thing that would remain
would be to take an accurate measure of the weight of the crown and divide
this by the volume of the crown. 
The resulting density figure could be compared with the density of gold,
and the truth would be known. It is said that with this revelation,
Archimedes leaped from his bath and ran, forgetting the state of his
undress, through the streets of Syracuse in Sicily exclaiming, “Eureka!—I
have found it!” on his way to the palace! A sad footnote to the story is
that the crown was indeed not the pure gold it had been portrayed as, and
the unfortunate merchant met an uncomfortable end. Or so they say.</p><p>
Carried one step further, the concept of specific gravity is based on the
physical law that an object immersed in water loses as much weight as an
equivalent volume of water would weigh. With a spring balance and a water
pan the students can determine the
specific gravity of a variety of minerals. Experience has shown that
fairly large specimens will give the best results. See Appendix 1 for
directions for labs on this and related topics; Activities 4, 5, and 6.</p>

<h3>IV. The Quartz Family</h3>
<h4>A. Characteristics</h4>
Once the student has become familiar with some of the characteristics of
minerals in general it is time to focus in on some specific examples.
Quartz is a good one with which to work as samples of a variety of forms
are easily obtainable and have the all- important virtues of both
durability and beauty. Quartz is at position 7 on the Mohs scale which
means that it is one of the hardest common minerals. It crystallizes from
the molten state at rather high temperatures but also can be deposited on
the ocean floor at only a few degrees above zero. It forms very beautiful
crystals that can be used as gem stones and is the source of crystals used
for technical purposes. It is also the major ingredient in sand. Flint is
a historically important form of quartz du e to its use in the early
weapons used by man to hunt wild game. 
<p>
In 1880 the Curies discovered another peculiar property of quartz while
studying the electrical conductivity of crystalline bodies. They
discovered that pressure on plates of quartz caused a deflection of the
needle on a sensitive electrometer. This is ca lled the piezoelectric
effect. It occurs when the crystal is squeezed slightly out of shape and
then springs back. This shape change actually affects the crystal at the
atomic level causing a movement of ions, with their attendant electric
charges. This m otion of the electrically charged particles constitutes
flow of electrons, or electricity. This particular characteristic is now
used to control and stabilize the frequency of a radio transmitter or to
regulate watches.4</p>
<h4>B. Types of Quartz</h4>
Probably the most familiar form of quartz is the clear, colorless form
known as <i>rock crystal.</i> These crystals can range in size from the
most
minute to the gigantic; one from Brazil weighed in at 5.5 tons! This clear
material has been used far back into hi story for carved goblets, bowls,
and other objects. 
<p>
Another form of quartz known and valued for its beauty is amethyst. This
mineral is almost pure SiO2 with only a trace of iron. As the amount of
iron increases, so does the intensity of the violet color, so it is
believed to be the coloring agent. Accordi ng to folklore the amethyst
gives its wearer great power, increased intelligence, and strength.</p><p>
<i>Smoky quartz</i> does not differ from clear quartz in chemical
composition. In
fact when it is heated to very high temperatures the “smoky” color
vanishes, and it looks identical to clear crystalline quartz. The color
can be restored by treating the crystal w ith a beam of x-ray radiation.
Scientists believe that the color of smoky quartz is a result of natural
radiation in the earth.</p><p>
<i>Agate</i> is a common form of quartz which does not have any external
evidence of its crystal nature. The extremely tiny crystalline particles are so intergrown that they appear smoothly mixed. Agate is used decoratively and as jewelry, especially in the onyx
form.5</p><p>
A form of quartz that is unique and appears to be most “un-quartz like” is
the <i>opal.</i> It contains a rather large percentage of water, ranging
from
four to twenty percent. And a complex internal structure of microscopic
silica fitted together in a lattice-p attern results in diffraction of the
light hitting it, forming rainbows of brilliant color as the gem is
rotated. Opal is a low-pressure and low-temperature mineral and is formed
at the earth’s surface by deposition from ground water or by the
evaporation
of hydrothermal, or hot water, springs as they rise to the surface and
cool leaving opal mineral behind. Because of the rather large amount of
water present in opal, it tends to be relatively soft (5.5 to 6.5) and low
in specific gravity. These qualities
limit its use as a gem, and it is usually found mounted in pendants and
pins where the stone is relatively protected.6</p>

<h3>V. Gems</h3>
<h4>A. Diamonds</h4>
Of all the gems diamonds seem to hold a special fascination for both
children and adults. Perhaps this is due to all the adventuresome stories
seen in movies and on television or perhaps it stems from a vague
understanding of the tremendous forces that cr eate diamonds and the
vexing inability of man with his modern technology to duplicate this feat
completely. 
<p>
Man is not at a total loss in this field. Currently we are producing some
44,000 pounds for industrial use annually by a process developed by H.
Tracy Hall for the General Electric Research Labs in the early 1950s. His
process involved a mixture of graphi te powder and an iron compound placed
in a hydraulic press. This press was able to generate a force of more than
1.5 million pounds per square inch! To that was added an electrical
current which heated the mix to over 4,800 degrees Fahrenheit. From this w
as produced low quality diamond grit used widely for industrial purposes
as an abrasive.</p><p>
Gem quality diamonds are another story. Instead of the less expensive
carbon sources which are used in the manufacture of industrial diamonds,
the feed material for gem quality diamonds is the industrial grit, and the
pressure and temperatures must be mai ntained for long periods of time, up
to a week. From this we can obtain gem quality diamonds of up to one
carat, but unfortunately the cost of manufacture is higher than the
present cost of mining the natural stones.7</p><p>
Natural diamonds are thought to be formed deep within the earth, probably
90 to 120 miles down within the upper regions of the mantle. Here
pressures of 975,000 pounds per square inch and temperatures of at least
2,700 degrees Fahrenheit may cause carbon atoms to crystallize into
tetrahedral shapes of great strength. Diamond is more resistant to
scratching than any other mineral, only another diamond can mark it. It is
resistant to acids and alkalis. It is brilliant and has very high
dispersive qualities which result in the flashes of light reflecting from
the cut stone.<i> Dispersion</i> is the ability of a substance to separate
white
light into its component colors just as a prism or water droplets forming
a rainbow. It also has a relatively high specific gravity, 3.5, which
results in it being found in <i>placer deposits,</i> those areas in stream
beds
where heavy and often valuable particles settle out and collect in
quantity.</p><p>
Diamonds were first found in India and for thousands of years this was the
only source. They were not mined but rather found in stream gravel and
alluvial deposits. Some famous stones from India with fascinating
histories are the Koh-i-nor and the Great M ogul. In the early 1700s
diamonds were discovered in Brazil. Men panning for gold found clear
pebbles that were later recognized as diamonds! Many of these South
American gems were shipped to India to be sold in their markets to
Europeans. As India’s sour ces began to dry up, Brazil became more
acceptable in the world’s eyes as a diamond source. And so for a while
Brazil was the principal producer of diamonds. Even today many fine
gemstones come from there.</p><p>
The most extraordinary diamond finds have occurred only within the last
one hundred years or so. In 1866 a Boer farmer’s son found a shiny pebble
on a river bank in South Africa. It turned out to be a 21.5 carat diamond!
Adventurers from all over the worl d descended on the site turning it into
a free-for-all not unlike the American gold rush. Diamonds were recovered
from the river bank, the surface soil, deeper “yellow ground,” and finally
at depths of fifty to sixty feet, the “blue ground.” This rock is the
original matrix which the diamonds formed in more than 15 million years
ago. Diamonds have also been found beneath the beach sand at the mouth of
the Orange River and now mining is being done in the Atlantic Ocean in
that area.8</p><p>
Very few diamonds have been found elsewhere in the world. An occasional
gem has been found in the American midwest in glacial deposits or in
dunes. And in Arkansas some have been found in their rock matrix similar
to the blue ground of South Africa. They have also been found in the
Soviet Union, but not much is known about these.</p>
<h4>B. Rubies and Sapphires</h4>
Two gems which are color variations of the same mineral, corundum, are
ruby and sapphire. Rubies contain a small amount of chromium, and
sapphires have titanium. They are very hard minerals, 9 on the Mohs scale,
and have a high specific gravity, 4.0. This
allows them to survive being washed great distances into alluvial
placers. An interesting variation of these gems is the “star” form which
results when needle-like impurities are aligned at angles of sixty degrees
to each other during the formation of th e stone. Unlike the highly
organized and businesslike enterprises that mine diamonds, the mining of
rubies and sapphires is a haphazard, sometimes dangerous endeavor. Most of
the rubies come from Burma or Thailand and sapphires come from Sri Lanka,
Austra lia, and surprisingly, Montana in the United States. Many of the
stones travel rather dubious routes and are handled by smugglers and
contraband dealers in open-air markets guarded by local police armed with
automatic rifles.9
<h4>C. Emeralds</h4>
Emeralds are quite different from their sister gems in that they are quite
soft, only 7.5 on the Mohs scale. They are the green form of beryl,
colored by the presence of chromium or vanadium. If rubies have wild tales
to tell, emeralds out-do them every t ime.10 Like something out of an
Indiana Jones story the history of emeralds includes torture,
conquistadors, native slaves imprisoned in tunnels, and lost treasure
maps. Both of the major emerald-producing regions in Colombia have violent
and greed-filled
pasts and presents. One of the areas had to be closed down due to the
astronomical numbers of murders and other crimes there. In addition to the
problems created by the human element, the mines are plagued by
mining-technique problems. The preferred mode
of obtaining the emeralds involves dynamiting the parent rock. Although
this does speed up the rock removal process, it also fragments many of the
emeralds crystals. As an example, the 632 carat Patricia emerald was
uncovered by a dynamite blast which al so destroyed what appeared to be an
even larger stone! Although emeralds are quite soft as gems go, they are
often mined from alluvial deposits. The places they are found, however,
are never far from their source or else they would be very eroded. Colombi
an stones are taken directly from the parent rock. Other countries which
produce emeralds are Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Brazil. Their stones are
considered, however, to be somewhat inferior in color or size.10
<h4>D. The Origins of Mineral Crystals</h4>
Although the geologic processes which produce minerals, gems, or
otherwise, vary in their specifics, there are some generalities to their
origins. Like all rocks they form by either igneous, sedimentary, or
metamorphic means. Igneous formations would incl ude diamonds, rubies,
sapphires, topaz, and garnet. These form when magma wells up through
cracks and fissures and is trapped in molten pockets. There, water,
dissolved gases, and rare elements combine and crystals begin to grow as
the molten mass slowly cools. The rock it forms is a mixture of minerals
called pegmatite characterized by its large chunks or crystals. With just
the right chemicals present and just the right ambient conditions this
pegmatite will hold precious gems. 
<i>Sedimentary</i> formations may contain gems with two separate
histories. Some of the sedimentary rocks hold crystals that were formed
elsewhere and then were moved by erosional forces to sediment basins where
they became part of the deposit. Other gems were f ormed when groundwater
seeped down through the volcanic ash or other sediments dissolving
minerals and moving them into pockets. Opal and turquoise are examples of
this type of gem.<p>
When tectonic processes, volcanic activity, or deep burial subject rock to
great heat and pressure, <i>metamorphic</i> forms may result. The partial
melting
of the parent rock allows specific minerals to escape and move to areas
where they concentrate into gems. 
Examples are garnets, which can be found here in Connecticut, and the
famous Burmese rubies and sapphires.</p>
<h4>E. Geodes</h4>
Geodes are hollow balls of mineral with numerous well-developed crystals
lining the walls of the interior. The formation of geodes is not well
understood and there are several theories that attempt to explain these
unusual shapes. Some geologists feel tha t they are merely hollow spaces
formed by gas bubbles trapped in molten rock when it cooled. This would
allow space for the projecting crystals to form but does not explain the
ease with which the geode separates from the host rock. Other geologists
think
the round shape was originally formed as a concretion which later eroded
away leaving a hollow space in which crystals grew. Still other
researchers put forth a rather complicated geologic scenario involving a
hollow of undetermined origin, its filling w ith fluids, including a
gelatinous silica layer which provides a semipermeable membrane for
osmotic movement of water into and out of the open space, and as a final
step the dehydration of the gel and the subsequent formation of crystals
from mineral rich
waters that leak into the opening through cracks.<p>
Displaying geodes to the students is an extremely valuable tool as it is
obvious to the group that the individual perfectly formed crystals could
not have been carved out by man. This idea of the human manufacture of
crystals, especially the particularly beautiful quartz or pyrite crystals,
is quite common among students at this grade level.</p>

<h3>VI. Crystals and Modern Technology</h3>
<h4>A. Introduction</h4>
Crystals have been valued by man throughout history as building materials
or ornamental objects. Today they are further valued as technological
materials. Solar cells and semiconductors are two recent developments
based on the unique properties of certain
crystals. Liquid crystals are another source of exciting possibilities
for the future.
<h4>B. Solar Cells</h4>
Solar cells are perhaps the most familiar to the student, as many of them
own solar-powered calculators, or have seen the solar panels on various
space vehicles. Inexpensive solar toys are available for student assembly
which emphasize the rather simple nature of their operation. The energy
produced by the solar cell is also called <i>photovoltaic energy.</i> The
solar
cell is made of silicon which has been infused with an impurity such as
boron. Silicon has a strongly bonded tetragonal crystal with pairs of sha
red electrons uniting it to its four neighbors. When the boron is added as
a substitutional impurity (see section II D) it will share its three
valence electrons with three of its silicon neighbors but is lacking a
fourth electron to share with the fourth
silicon neighbor. This absence of an electron is called a hole. So the
addition of boron results in a “hole” which is considered to be a positive
charge. Next we diffuse a very thin layer of phosphorus into the top of
the boron silicon. Phosphorus is dif ferent from boron in that it has five
valence electrons, one more than it needs to join into the stable bonding
with silicon. So this extra electron is free to move among the electron
shells, in some cases filling in boron holes, but usually resulting in an
excess of electrons moving around. These are called conduction electrons.
The silicon region with holes is called the “p-type layer” and the region
with the excess of conduction electrons is called the “n-type layer.”11
<p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
As the conduction electrons move in to fill in the holes, a peculiar thing
happens. The boron atoms which take up the electrons in their holes now
become negative ions! And the phosphorous which has given the conduction
electron up now becomes a positive ion! This results in a boundary called
the p-n junction where holes with their positive charge and electrons with
their negative charge are repelled by the charged ions that set them
loose. So the excess conduction electrons are unable to move across the
boundary to fill in the holes. This results in electrons building up in
the n-type layer and holes will collect in the p-type layer.</p><p>
Electrons move toward the p-type side and holes (positive) move toward the
n-type side until a dynamic equilibrium is reached. Ionized boron repels
further movement of electrons and ionized phosphorus repels further
movement of holes (positives).</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
When photons strike the solar cell, bonded electrons are bounced right out
of their positions creating many more conduction n-electrons and holes on
both sides of the junction. Since there are already so many electrons on
the n-type side and so many holes
on the p-type side, the additional new ones are only a tiny proportion;
but by making new holes on the n-type side and new conduction electrons on
the p-type side, the solar cell is unbalanced. The electrons from the
p-type side move across the junction creating a flow of electrons, or
electricity! This flow moves electrons out through the n-type layer onto a
conductive wire grid which is connected to a circuit that is completed by
an attachment to the p-type layer.12 Read more about this fascinating but
complex topic in Chalmers’ article or Swan’s book.</p><p>
<i>Solar cell circuit in which conduction electrons move toward the n-type
crystal where they travel to the current collector on the surface of the
cell and move through the external circuit to the p-type crystal
area.13</i>
</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p>
<h4>C. Transistors</h4>
Transistors are constructed of the same types of materials as described in
the section on solar cells. These materials are called semi-conductors and
when bonded together form a p-n junction which is influenced by the
addition of a voltage differential pl aced across it rather than the
effects of photons of sunlight. When these thin layers of semi-conductors
are sandwiched together they make up a transistor which can be used to
regulate the flow of electrons in circuits, detect and amplify radio
signals, p roduce oscillations in transmitters, and act as digital
switches. These tiny solids were the first electrical components in which
materials with different electrical characteristics were physically joined
by structural contact rather than by wires.14
<h4>D. Liquid Crystals</h4>
Another interesting crystal technology involves a crystal which is not a
solid. The melting point of a pure crystalline substance is very precise.
And in some cases the crystalline properties of a solid crystal carry over
into the liquid state. There are many compounds that will do this. Their
atomic structure remains quite orderly even while taking on the other
characteristics of typical liquids such as pouring or taking on the shape
of its container. Selective reflection of white light into its various
spectral components by these liquid crystals can be directed and
controlled by thermal, acoustical, electrical, magnetic, and even
mechanical means. Wrist watches and clocks whose numbers melt from one
display into another are liquid crystals. Window glas s can be made dim or
clear depending on the intensity of the sunlight passing through. An
exciting futuristic application of the liquid crystal would be flat plates
or screens hung on walls which display television images. 
The simplest or first generation display capability with a single
electrical lead connected to a single picture element forms the
seven-segment number displays as seen on clocks and watches. Second
generation displays attach four picture elements to one e lectrical lead
and displays the seven segment numbers and also star-burst shapes which
can form letters or numbers, useful for pocket calculators.15<p>
More complex wiring and liquid crystals with helical (spiral) axis
positions can display 5-32 elements per electrical lead and are used for
personal computers. The newest experimental versions are capable of
producing TV picture displays on a flat substrate.</p><p>
Liquid crystals are true liquids but also have some solid properties.
Their internal order is very delicate and can be changed by a weak
electrical field, magnetism, or even temperature variations. Noticeable
optical effects are the result of re-arrangeme nt of the molecules and the
resulting changes in refraction (light-bending), reflection, absorption,
scattering, or coloring of the visible light from their surface. Liquid
crystals modify the ambient light rather than emit their own light and
therefore r equire minimal amounts of power. A typical LCD (liquid crystal
device) uses one microwatt per square centimeter of display area.16</p><p>
A very simplified diagram below shows the effect of an electric current on
liquid crystal molecules. This change is visible due to its effect on
light waves.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Some liquid crystals are sensitive to temperature, and are used as a
component in thermometers. They can be used in diagnostic tools to detect
cancers, pulmonary disease, and vascular diseases. Their dramatic color
variations are caused by an actual helical swing of 360 degrees by the
molecules! The diagram below shows this 360 degree reorientation
process.17</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
A uniform starting position for the crystals is vital to their usefulness.
Liquid crystals can be aligned by “rubbing” of the substrate. Until
recently this was poorly understood but used as a standard practice
anyway. It is now known that the rubbing res ults in microgrooves which
serve to orient the molecules.l8</p><p>
Although liquid crystal technology has only recently been exploited by man
for diagnostic tools, displays, new materials such as kevlar, and
oil-recovery technology, nature has used these peculiar molecules in
living systems right along. The structure of cell membranes and some
tissues are liquid crystals. Hardening of the arteries is a result of the
deposition of liquid crystals of cholesterol, cells involved in sickle
cell anemia have liquid crystal structure, and on a brighter note, it may
soon be poss ible to change the solid form of a gall stone into a liquid
crystal form that can be flushed from the body.19 For further information
see the Brown or Kahn articles.</p><p>
The technological development of crystals has taken off in this generation
from semiconductors to transistors to integrated circuits to microchips.
Always getting smaller but with vastly increased information handling
abilities. They are the mainstay of t he space and military industries,
making possible the impossible in distant space travel, satellite
technology, and weapons’ accuracy.</p><p>
Solar cells are becoming more efficient and more common, and as our energy
problems increase, student interest in solar technology has also
increased. And the liquid crystals in our students’ watches and pocket
calculators are just one more bit of technology waiting to be explained
to our students.</p><p>
There are many very helpful books and articles which can aid the reader in
his or her understanding of these interesting, complex topics. Many of
these have been listed in the bibliography, but I would like to
specifically recommend the Holden book, <i>The Nature of Solids,</i> and
the
Chalmers article, “Photovoltaic Generation of Electricity,” as two
excellent readings with which to begin. They will provide you with the
information you will want to feel confident about teaching about crystal
technology.</p><p>
All of the books and articles that are specifically referred to in the
text of this unit are available in book or reprint form at the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute office on Wall Street, New Haven.</p>

</dt></dl> <b><i>Directions </i> </b>We have measured the density directly by
using a ruler to find the volume of a regularly-shaped object. We can
determine the density of an irregularly-shaped object using the
displacement method. We will weigh the object on the scale to find mass;
then we will use the graduated cylinder to find out how much water is
displaced by the object when it is submerged. The amount of water
displaced is the same as the volume of the object. Then we have only to
put the numbers in our formula:<p>
Density = mass/volume</p><p>

</dt><dt>4. Submerge one of the objects in the graduated cylinder. Record the new water level on the chart below. Repeat for each object.
</dt><dt>5. Subtract the first reading (50 mL) from the second reading. This is the volume displaced, or the volume of the object.
</dt><dt>6. Divide the mass by the volume to find the density. Remember 1 mL = 1 cm.3

<h4>Activity 7</h4>
<b><i>Objective </i> </b> to develop skills in mineral identification
using some characteristics of minerals.<p>
<b><i>Materials</i></b>
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>mineral samples	</td><td>	compass
</td></tr><tr><td>penny	</td><td>		paper towels
</td></tr><tr><td>steel nail	</td><td>		lemon juice or dilute
</td></tr><tr><td>hardened file	</td><td>	hydrochloric acid (Use acid only on
samples kept at demonstration table—do not contaminate your samples at
your desk.) 
</td></tr><tr><td>streak plate		
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<b><i>Procedure</i></b>
</p>
<dl><dt>1. Read each mineral identification characteristic and use the suggested term or property to describe the mineral you are examining. Repeat for each mineral.
</dt><dt>2. Characteristics:
</dt><dt><i>Color:</i> apparent external color: black, brown, gray-white,
brownish-white, etc.
</dt><dt><i>Luster:</i> describes the shine or light-reflection from a mineral:
metallic, pearly, greasy, glassy, silky.
</dt><dt><i>Hardness:</i> describes the resistance to scratching and is
measured by the Mohs scale of hardness, #1 to #10, softest to hardest. To
test hardness, scratch your sample with the following items in order. When
a visible scratch is made (a dent in the rock), that is the hardness.
<dl>
<dt>			2.5—fingernail
</dt><dt>			3—penny
</dt><dt>			4-5—steel file
</dt><dt>			6—hardened file
</dt><dt> over 7—may scratch a plate but leaves no color </dt></dl>
</dt><dt><i>Streak:</i> describes the color of the powdered mineral. The streak
can have a different color from the external apparent color. It is
determined by rubbing the sample firmly over the plate, the color on the
plate is the streak. A mineral of hardness 7 or
over will have no streak, but may scratch the plate instead.
</dt><dt><i>Magnetism:</i> minerals that are magnetic will cause a compass
needle to spin.
</dt><dt><i>Crystal structure:</i> Use your paper crystal models to determine
the crystal shape of your sample.
</dt><dt><i>Acid test:</i> Put one or two drops of a weak acid on your sample
(be sure
to use the samples on the demonstration table). If the mineral bubbles and
fizzes it contains carbonate. The gas being released is carbon dioxide. 
</dt><dt><i>Heft:</i> refers to the weight per volume or size. Terms that could
be used would be “heavy,” “medium,” or “light.” These are only relative
and imprecise terms but useful for comparing with specific gravity.

<h3>Appendix 3</h3>
<h4>Growing Crystals</h4>
In this section you will find condensed directions for making crystals
from a solution, from a melt, and from a vapor. You will find it very
helpful to obtain Elizabeth Wood’s book, <i>Crystals—A Handbook for School
Teachers,</i> or the Alan Holden book, <i>Crystals and Crystal Growing</i> 
for trouble shooting or for more extensive examples and explanations.
These
books can be borrowed from the New Haven Teachers Institute office. <p> To
grow crystals from an <i>alum solution</i> dissolve 4 teaspoons of alum
powder in
a half cup of hot water. Stir until all of the powder dissolves. Cover the
beaker with paper or cloth to keep the dust out and slow evaporation. 
Crystals will begin to form on the bottom of the container. It is
important to keep your solution free from drafts or temperature changes.
If your room has a widely varying temperature range, set the beaker in a
large bucket of water, being careful not to get extra water in the beaker.
The water will help prevent any rapid temperature changes.</p><p>
When some good size crystals have formed, pour off and save the solution
and carefully pick out the best crystals with tweezers. Dry the crystals
and the tweezers well. Now pour the solution back into the beaker with the
remaining crystal masses and gently reheat and redissolve the solute.</p><p>
The next step is a real test of your dexterity! You must fasten the
crystal to a thread, either by means of a slip knot or with a minuscule
spot of glue (Duco cement is good). Suspend your hanging crystal “seed” in
the cooled solution and cover the top. It is important to be sure there
are no extraneous crystal grains on the sides of your crystal seed, on the
thread, or in the container. Growth of your seed will be impeded by them.
Again place the beaker in the water bath to control temperature during the
growing time. This process would result in a single, large, well-formed
crystal.20</p><p>
Other substances which can form nice crystals are borax, salt, sugar,
copper sulfate, and Epsom salts. The amount of solute will vary, but you
can determine the appropriate amount by trial and error or by checking one
of the books given above.</p><p>
To grow crystals from a <i>melt</i>, obtain some salol (phenyl salicylate,
HOC6H4COOC6H5) from a drugstore. Put a small amount on a glass slide or
sheet of aluminum pie plate, and heat it with a candle. Since it melts at
42 degrees Celsius, you will not need much flame. As it cools, put a tiny
grain of salol powder on the melted salol; this will act as a seed for the
crystal to grow around.21</p><p>
To grow crystals from a <i>vapor,</i> obtain some naphthalene
(moth-flakes,
C10H8). CAUTION—NAPHTHALENE IS VERY FLAMMABLE AND MUST NOT BE HEATED NEAR
AN OPEN FLAME! Woods suggests placing a few flakes in a tall glass jar and
placing a loose cover (aluminum foil)  on top. Place the base of the jar
on a lighted 100 watt bulb, and soon you will see the rising vapor
sublimating (changing from vapor to solid) onto the top sides of the
container. This experiment should be done in a very well ventilated room,
preferably within a vented hood.22</p>
