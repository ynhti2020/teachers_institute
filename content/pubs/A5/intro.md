This volume presents twelve of the more than six hundred curriculum
units that have been prepared since 1978 by Fellows of the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute. Although these selected units undoubtedly
contain both research and pedagogical strategies that teachers elsewhere
might well adapt to their own purposes, we do not offer them as plans to
be followed or models to be imitated. Their importance is more
fundamental and more complex. They stand here as examples of the
distinctive process of individual curriculum development in which the
Fellows of the Institute have been engaged.<p>
As James R. Vivian stated in his introduction to <i>Teaching in America:
The
Common Ground</i>, the Institute has been guided by four principles: a
belief
in the importance of the classroom teacher and of teacher-developed
materials for effective learning; an insistence that teachers of students
at different levels interact as colleagues, addressing their common
problems; a conviction that any effort to improve teaching must be
"teacher-centered," and a consequent reliance upon Institute
Coordinators, teachers who meet weekly with the Director and constitute
an essential part of the program's leadership; and a certainty that the
University can assist in improving the public schools only if it makes a
significant and long-term commitment to do so. The Institute therefore
makes use of no curriculum experts in the usual sense, no short-term
workshops, no regular graduate courses in methods or content. Instead,
it brings together teachers from the New Haven public schools and the
Yale University faculty in a genuinely collaborative endeavor.</p><p>
Each year the Director and the Coordinators determine, through discussion
among themselves and consultation with other teachers in the schools, the
areas in which Institute seminars might most usefully be offered. (In
recent years, funding has made possible four seminars in the humanities
and social studies, and two seminars in sciences and mathematics.) Yale
faculty who might teach in the selected areas are then invited to submit
seminar proposals. After further canvassing other teachers, the
Coordinators select the seminars to be offered. It is understood that each
will be an opportunity for shared study and also the occasion for the
preparation of curriculum units that the Fellows plan to use in the
ensuing
year.</p><p>
The balance between academic preparation and classroom application, and
between common study and individual projects, will be understood
somewhat differently in each seminar. And there are no doubt many ways
of crossing the somewhat artificial boundary between "subject" and
"pedagogical method." In the main, however, the collegiality that is so
important to the Institute rests on the assumption that the member of the
Yale faculty who leads the seminar will bring some special competence in
an academic field, and that the Fellows (who are not "students" but full
members of the Yale community, with library privileges and stipend) will
bring their special competencies in the aims, needs, and problems of their
home classrooms.</p><p>
After selecting the seminars for the year, the Coordinators invite
applications from teachers in the public schools. (Originally limited to
high-school teachers, the Institute has expanded to include teachers from
middle schools and, most recently, elementary schools.) Any successful
application must contain a preliminary proposal for a curriculum unit that
might be prepared in conjunction with a seminar, and authorization by the
teacher's supervisor to incorporate such a unit in the teaching assigned
for the ensuing year. Until very recently, the Institute has been able to
accept all applications that meet those criteria.</p><p>
The preliminary proposals, of course, are just that: each will be revised,
after consultation with the seminar leader, into a "Final Unit Topic" of
about 250 words with initial reading list, then into a "Prospectus" of two
to four pages, then into a "First Draft" of about ten single-spaced pages
that sets forth the unit's objectives and strategies, then a "Second
Draft"
of 15-25 pages that also includes lesson plans and bibliographies, and
then a final draft of the "Completed Unit." This process of writing, which
will benefit from suggestions by the seminar leader and the other
Fellows, will be carried out concurrently with the common study of a
seminar that meets once in March, once in April, and weekly from May
through mid-July.</p><p>
The seminars offered by the Institute-88 of them between 1978 and
1991-have ranged widely in topic and procedure. Some, especially in
the
sciences, have tended toward a lecture format; others have placed major
emphasis upon informal discussion of a series of texts. All have found
place for some sharing by the Fellows of their pedagogical interests and
problems. And some have also incorporated field trips, laboratory
projects, exercises in theatrical presentation, and additional writing
assignments. A bare sampling may serve here as an indication of the range
of the seminars and the commitment of Yale faculty to this enterprise.</p><p>
History seminars have included "Themes in Twentieth-Century American
Culture" and "Odysseys: Nineteenth- and Twentieth-Century African
American History Through Personal Narrative" (led by Jean-Christophe
Agnew), "Courts, Congress and the Constitution" (Robert A. Burt),
"Immigrants and American Identity" (James T. Fisher), "Remarkable City:
Industrial New Haven and the Nation: 1800-1900" and "Multi-Disciplinary
Studies in American Regions and Regionalism" (Howard R. Lamar), and "An
Interdisciplinary Approach to British Studies," "The Writing of History:
Writing as History," and "The U. S. National Parks Movement" (Robin W.
Winks).</p><p>
Seminars in literature and allied fields have included "Greek
Civilization"
(Victor Bers), "Autobiography" (Richard H. Brodhead), "History as Fiction
in Central and South America" and "Writings and Re-Writings of the
Discovery and Conquest of America " (Roberto
González-Echevarría), "The
Family in Literature" and "Epic, Romance and the American Dream"
(Traugott Lawler), "Topics in Western Civilization: Ideals of Community
and the Development of Urban Life" (Lawrence J. Manley), "Society and
Literature in Latin America" and "Hispanic Minorities in the United
States" (Nicolas Shumway), "Twentieth-Century American Fiction,
Biography, and Autobiography" (Robert B. Stepto), "The 'City' in American
Literature and Culture" (Alan Trachtenberg), "Contemporary American
Drama: Scripts and Performance" and "Recent American Poetry: Expanding
the Canon" (Thomas R. Whitaker), and "Society and the Detective Novel"
(Robin W. Winks).</p><p>
The Institute's pervasive concern with writing has sometimes been given
special emphasis, as in "Writing Across the Curriculum" (Joseph W.
Gordon) and "The Process of Writing" and "Writing About American
Culture" (Thomas R. Whitaker). Seminars in art have included "Elements of
Architecture" (Kent C. Bloomer), "Art, Artifacts, and Material Culture"
and "The Family in Art and Material Culture" (Jules D. Prown), and
"America as Myth" (Bryan J. Wolf).</p><p>
The smaller number of seminars in the sciences and mathematics have
nevertheless been quite various. The biological sciences have been
represented by "Genetics" (Margretta R. Seashore),
"Adolescence/Adolescents' Health" (Walter Anyan), and "Human Fetal
Development" (Maurice J. Mahoney), among others; both biological and
physical sciences by a seminar in "Global Environmental Change" (Karl K.
Turekian); and the physical sciences by such topics as "Geology and the
Industrial History of Connecticut" (Robert B. Gordon), "Engineering and
Science at Work: Coal Combustion and Nuclear Fission as Sources of
Electricity" (Charles A. Walker), "Aerodynamics: Its Science,
Applications, Recent History, and Impact on Transportation" (Peter P.
Wegener), "Electrical Technologies: Light at Nite, Microelectronics,
Superconductivity?" (Robert G. Wheeler), and "Crystals in Science and
Technology" (Werner P. Wolf). Mathematics has entered significantly into
many seminars in the sciences, has been prominent in seminars on
statistical approaches to adolescent psychology (William Kessen), and has
also been a topic in its own right (in seminars led by Robert Sczarba and
Charles E. Rickart).</p><p>
The curriculum units prepared in conjunction with the seminars have been
yet more diverse. The later descriptions of the twelve units included here
will point to some of the ways in which Fellows have been able to relate
seminar topics to their own teaching needs. Special attention should be
called, however, to certain kinds of units that are not adequately
represented in this volume because the invited authors did not elect to
engage in the further revision that it entailed. Many units, such as
Maureen
C. Howard's "Steinbeck: Biography as a Tool in Teaching Reading and
Writing Skills" or Patricia A. Niece's "Horacio Quiroga: The Poe of Latin
America," would fit easily into conventional courses in literature.
Another group comprises units, such as Doris A. Vazquez's "La Nueva
Canción en Puerto Rico" or Belinda M. Carberry's "The Revolution in
Journalism with an Emphasis on the 1960s and 1970s," that deal with
some aspect of popular culture. There are also studies of a historical
figure, such as Henry A. Rhodes' "Lincoln, the Great Emancipator?," and of
the art of some historical period, such as Linda Powell's "Egyptian Tomb
Art: Expression of Religious Beliefs."</p><p>
There are also a good many ways of approaching the sciences, as in
Elisabet O. Orville's "Perception and Sense Organs-A Writing Unit for
Biology," or Beverly B. Stern's "The Basic Conceptions of Diagnostic
Ultrasound," or Margaret M. Loos's "Let There Be Light," or Robert W.
Mellette's "Space Shuttle Science"-as well as a number of ingenious
approaches to mathematics, such as Michael Conte's "Mathematics in You,"
Sheryl A. Hershonik's "Lunar Eclipse: Fact and Myth," Joyce Bryant's
"Mathematics: Problems on Coal and Energy," and David Howell's "The
Statistical Sampler." A small volume, indeed, cannot begin to do justice
to the great variety of curriculum units that the Fellows of the Institute
have prepared over the years.</p><p>
It should be clear, however, that most units tend toward the personal in
style and the interdisciplinary in scope. That is so for several good
reasons. At the elementary and middle-school levels, the teacher's
responsibilities are often interdisciplinary by definition. At the higher
grade-levels, in an inner-city environment with many poorly prepared or
poorly motivated students, the teacher may most easily demonstrate the
relevance of a subject, arouse interest in it, and pursue its exciting
implications in some interdisciplinary context. Those pedagogical
necessities are often compounded these days by the fact that many urban
teachers have been assigned to subjects for which they have had no
adequate college-level training, and must therefore make use of their
curriculum units in part as a mode of self-education in a field somewhat
new to them. And the personal style? Fellows of the Institute provide
massive testimony that their own teaching is most engaging and
successful when they are presenting to the class a unit that they have
themselves developed.</p><p>
These points have been highlighted and further developed by Peter Joseph
Casarella, in his Institute-sponsored study of the curriculum units
prepared from 1979 through 1985. Casarella found that the units are most
often presented in a first-person narrative style that offers a synthesis
of research and pedagogy. Some units may emphasize research and others
pedagogy, but the norm is some integration of the two concerns. Elisabet
O. Orville's "Pollination Ecology in the Classroom," for example, was
structured to facilitate the exposition of her research on pollination
ecology; a relatively small part of the unit was devoted to a distinct
teaching purpose. On the other hand, Richard Canalori and Farrell Sandal's
"Enthusiasm is All Write" was structured to develop a comprehensive
course in writing for sixth grade; the research for the unit was oriented
entirely toward pedagogical problems. More characteristic of the bulk of
the units prepared in the Institute, however, were those that combined
research and pedagogy in some personal synthesis. Casarella found such
syntheses in every discipline-for example, in Norine Polio's "An
Analysis
of <i>The Oxcart</i> by René Marqués, Puerto Rican
Playwright," in D. Jill
Savitt's "Sex Roles, Courting and Marriage Among Puerto Rican
Teenagers," and in David Howell's "The Statistical Sampler." Sometimes
the author treated the elements specified by the Institute guidelines
(objectives, strategies, and lesson plans) in separate sections unified
only
by mutual implication and a strong narrative voice. At other times the
integration dictated a more complete fusion of those elements in a single
coherent essay. It is clear from Casarella's report that, regardless of
the
format chosen, the main thrust of the Institute work is toward some
mediation between research and pedagogy according to the needs of
students and the interests and talents of the teachers. The editorial

Fortunately, the units prepared by the Fellows are not merely "course
papers" for a seminar. Designed as teaching materials, they have been read
in-process by other Fellows, and they receive local publication in a
volume of units produced by each seminar, with distribution to schools
throughout New Haven. Sometimes the authors may conduct workshops on
their topics at other schools. Colleagues in the same school and at other
schools often incorporate part or all of a unit in their own teaching. In
subsequent years a unit may be revised by the author, and by others, as
the
experience of teaching may suggest. Indeed, there is much evidence that a
significant revision of curriculum has taken place in the New Haven
system by this grass-roots method.</eparation></p><p>
Institute surveys of 1981 and 1985 indicated that the extent of use of
these curriculum units, by Institute participants and by other teachers,
had more than doubled during that period. In 1985 such units were taught
in more than fifteen hundred school classes attended by more than thirty
thousand students. A third of all New Haven secondary school teachers,
whether or not they had been Fellows, were using these materials. A high
proportion of the units prepared since 1978 were remaining in use, and the
frequency of use did not depend upon how recently they had been
written.<br/>
Many of the teachers who used the units were in fact using two or more,
and nearly half were using three or more. There is also suggestive
evidence that the participation in Institute seminars and the writing of
units may have helped to sustain an interest in a profession that the
American people have not yet decided to recognize according to its true
social value. In 1985, despite substantial turn-over of teaching personnel
in New Haven, most of those who had taken greatest advantage of the
Institute remained teaching in this city.</p><p>
Summaries, generalizations, and statistics will take us only so far. A
more vivid and complex impression of the curriculum development that is
being fostered by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute can be gained
only through an attentive reading of selected instances. Hence this
volume.
A few introductory comments on the twelve units presented here will help
to set the stage for such a reading.</p>

<h4>II</h4>
The twelve units selected to exemplify the process of curriculum
development in the Institute are excellent in various ways, but they
should not be read as significantly more original or more thoughtful than
many others. Indeed, the task of selection was complex, difficult, and to
some extent determined by factors unrelated to the quality of the units.
On the basis of recommendations by seminar leaders, supplemented by the
editor's reading of nearly all the units prepared since 1978, a
preliminary
list was drawn up of no less than sixty units that clearly deserved
national distribution. That list was reduced by the editor, with an eye to
appropriate representation of various disciplines and various approaches
to unit-writing, to a final list of thirty units. (Most of those
eliminated at
this point were in subjects that have been prominent in the Institute's
work since its inception: history, literature, and social studies.)
Invitations were then issued to twenty-nine authors, one now being
deceased, to engage in some minor revisions that might clarify their
accounts for readers unacquainted with the New Haven schools, update
bibliographies where appropriate, and indicate if possible something about
the experience of teaching the unit and its importance in the author's
career. Eleven of the units in this volume constitute the response to that
invitation. The twelfth unit, by the Fellow now deceased, is presented as
originally written. If time and energy were less severely limited than
they
are for most of us who teach, we might have been able to present at least
five volumes comparable to this one! Indeed, if readers are interested in
consulting units in fields or on topics quite different from those
included
here, they should direct an inquiry to the Institute office.<p>
As it happens, these twelve units suggest much of the usual range of
disciplinary and interdisciplinary work in the Institute. Seven units are
designed for high school, four for middle schools, and one for elementary
school. Eight units are in the humanities and social studies, four in
sciences and mathematics. Those proportions are roughly in accord with
the emphases in Institute seminars over the years. The most distinctive
qualities of these units, however, are quite individual. They are evident
in
many ways, but above all, perhaps, in the ingenuity and persistence with
which the Fellows have met the extremely difficult challenges posed by
their teaching situations.</p><p>
The volume begins appropriately with "Melting Pot Theater: Teaching for
Understanding," a unit by Bill Derry, an Itinerant Arts Teacher in
elementary schools. Derry offers a "master plan" for a coordinated effort
requiring the contributions of several teachers and resource persons.
Using drama as his major tool, he proposes to facilitate the teaching of
grades 1-4 about the cultures of Puerto Rico, Russia, and Ghana. Though
the unit is unusually ambitious, its integration of subjects and resources
is characteristic of much elementary-school teaching. And its approach
will be familiar to those acquainted with the work of Dorothy Heathcote
and other drama educators. Derry's unit was prepared in conjunction with
the seminar on "Contemporary Drama: Scripts and Performance," led by
Thomas R. Whitaker in 1990. Although the reading and performance
activities in that seminar centered on plays for adults, the Fellows were
mainly elementary and middle-school teachers who developed projects
suited to their classroom responsibilities. In effect, the subject of the
seminar became "Learning Through Drama."</p><p>
The four middle-school units cover an interesting gamut of subjects. "Who
Do You Think You Are?" was developed by Bill Coden, an English teacher for
an arts-magnet middle school, in conjunction with a seminar of 1982 led
by Richard H. Brodhead on "Autobiography." Coden uses the challenges of
student autobiography as means of addressing the teaching of skills in
reading and writing. Through a series of adaptations and extensions, this
unit has been central to his later teaching. In 1988 he developed a
unit
on journal-writing, which also incorporated readings from longer
autobiographical works. And in 1990 he developed a unit on Chicano
literature that deals with similar themes of memory. Each unit responded
to a distinct need, but he is now most comfortable when combining
elements from each in his teaching.</p><p>
Benjamin A. Gorman, a social-studies teacher in a middle school,
developed "The Community and You: Learning Your Way Around Fair Haven"
in conjunction with a seminar of 1989 led by James T. Fisher on
"American Communities, 1880-1980." This unit is intended to help low
and middle achievers to become more aware of the ways in which
geography and history impinge upon their own lives. The anecdotes, the
richly detailed historical information, and the mapping activities are of
course specific to Fair Haven, Connecticut, but one can easily imagine a
unit of this kind being developed in other communities throughout the
nation.</p><p>
"The Chronicles of the New World, Shakespeare's <i>The Tempest</i>, and
E.S.O.L.
Instruction," by Norine Polio, a teacher in a Bilingual Department, is a
unit
of a very different kind. Developed in a seminar of 1986 led by Roberto
González-Echevarría on "Writings and Re-Writings of the
Discovery and
Conquest of America," it uses the reading and interpretation of
Shakespeare's play as an occasion for considering, by way of Caliban, the
problems of instruction in a second language. This unit clearly aims to
instruct other teachers as much as middle-school students. Since
developing it, Norine Polio has modified it for use with mainstream
humanities and reading classes, and has also used it to culminate a year
long curriculum based on materials from the periods of the Conquest.</p><p>
The fourth middle-school unit presented here, "Crystals: More Than Meets
the Eye," by Lois Van Wagner, is designed for the eighth-grade Earth
Science curriculum. Developed in conjunction with a seminar of 1989 led
by Werner P. Wolf on "Crystals in Science and Technology," this unit
brings together a wealth of material on atomic and molecular structure,
shapes of crystals, characteristics of minerals, and the uses of crystals
in modern technology. Since developing this unit, Lois Van Wagner has
adapted it, by amplifying or omitting sections, to meet the needs of
students with a range of abilities.<br/>
<br/>
The seven high-school units-two in English, two in history, two in
mathematics, and one in biological science-illustrate a variety of
strategies for relating school subjects to contexts that may provide
additional motivation or insight. "Seascape: Beginning Explorations" was
developed by Phyllis Taylor, an English teacher at Sound School, which
shapes its curriculum in ways that emphasize the marine life and
maritime activities associated with Long Island Sound. The unit was
written in conjunction with a history seminar of 1982, "An Unstable
World: The West in Decline?", led by Robin W. Winks. Phyllis Taylor chose
to use the theme of ocean exploration to provide interest and continuity
for a course that teaches reading, thinking, writing, and speaking to high
school freshmen. Because this unit incorporates non-fiction, fiction, and
poetry, it constitutes one kind of introduction to literature. Phyllis
Taylor
died in the summer of 1989-while a participant in Traugott Lawler's
seminar on "Poetry"; her unit is therefore presented here without further
revision.</p><p>
"American Detectives: On TV and in Books," was developed by Jane K.
Marshall in conjunction with a seminar of 1989 on "Detective Fiction: Its
Use as Literature and as History," also led by Robin Winks. This unit is
an
example of an unusually advanced phase in a Fellow's work in the
Institute. It was prepared as the final chapter of a book that Jane
Marshall
has written on the basis of several units intended for her course in
"Visual Art and Literature." Previous units had dealt with the study of
material culture, the comparison of poetry and photography, and the
comparison of film and fiction-all as correlated with a study of
social
history. This culminating unit brings together instances of popular
culture
in ways that maintain rigor of analysis, both thematic and technical.</p><p>
The two units in history provide an opportunity for somewhat closer
comparison of strategies. "From <i>Plessy v. Ferguson </i>to <i>Brown v.
Board of
Education</i>: The Supreme Court Rules on School Desegregation" was
developed by Karen Wolff in conjunction with a seminar of 1982 on "The
Constitution in American History and American Life," led by Robert M.
Cover. It was originally prepared for the history half of an
interdisciplinary course in English and history at the High School in the
Community, a magnet school that emphasizes teacher-initiated
curriculum. Karen Wolff has since used the unit in teaching a variety of
other subjects-statistics and poll-making, drama in the courtroom,
and
philosophy as reflected in legal systems throughout history-and she
has
also expanded it into a larger course on the American legal system.
Indeed,
this unit was for her the beginning of a major new direction in her
teaching career.</p><p>
"The Constitution, Censorship and the Schools: <i>Tennessee v. John Thomas
Scopes</i>" was developed by Peter Neal Herndon in conjunction with a
seminar of 1988 on "Courts, Congress and the Constitution" led by Robert
A. Burt. This unit was originally intended for a course in United States
history, and it has since been used in courses at various levels
emphasizing issues in Constitutional law. Where Karen Wolff leads
students through a series of legal decisions, Peter Herndon invites them
to examine in detail the issues (and the drama) involved in a major trial.
In different ways, both units relate their subjects to questions of
continuing urgency and provide opportunities for critical thinking and
writing.</p><p>
The two units in mathematics also provide instructive comparisons. Both,
in fact, were prepared in conjunction with a seminar of 1990 on "What
Makes Airplanes Fly? History, Science and Applications of Aerodynamics"
led by Peter P. Wegener. The first unit, "The History of Flight and Some
Mathematical Applications," by Hermine Smikle, aims to present
mathematical concepts that are not usually taught to students categorized
as "low achievers," and to do so by relating them to the history of
aeronautics. After its historical overview, the unit uses the topic of
navigation to approach a variety of rather complex problems in plane and
spherical geometry and graph theory. The second unit, "Ship and Airplane
Testing:  Physics for High School Mathematics Students," by James
Francis Langan, transposes the seminar's theme into the realm of naval
architecture. Langan is another teacher at Sound School, and he engages
problems in hydrodynamics and model-building by way of the history of
our understanding of solid and fluid bodies, gravitation, and the
mechanical and mathematical principles that pertain to them. He proposes
a context for learning some difficult mathematical concepts, and one that
may also eventuate in student projects on the history of naval
technology.</p><p>
The last unit presented here, "Creation, Evolution, and the Human
Genome," was developed by Anthony B. Wight in a seminar of 1990 on
"Genetics" led by Margretta R. Seashore. Designed for use in an
interdisciplinary science and humanities course, taught with a colleague
in English, this unit deals with theories and debates and discoveries
concerning the origins of life, its evolution, and its chemical basis. It
serves as one example of how a teacher may tactfully handle difficult
questions of interpretation in a scientific context, and how a course can
lead from the history of science on toward more technical questions
concerning molecular biology.</p><p>
A dozen units, a dozen different ways of bringing to the inner-city
classroom a lively concern for a specific and often freshly defined
subject-matter, the needs and interests of students, and a humane
understanding of our social context. These units will now serve also, we
hope, to make clear to readers in other communities and other institutions
the vitality of curriculum development that can result from a
collaborative program that pays attention to academic subjects,
pedagogical challenges, and the process of writing.</p><p>
