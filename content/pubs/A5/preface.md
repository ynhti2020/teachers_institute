In 1982 Fred M. Hechinger wrote his first of several columns in <i>The New
York Times </i>on the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. He described the
Institute's establishment in 1978 as signaling a "reversal of the twenty
year breach between universities and schools."1 The next year the late
Yale President A. Bartlett Giamatti and Ernest L. Boyer, President of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, convened a national
conference of Chief State School Officers and college and university
presidents, which the Institute organized at Yale. At the meeting,
attended
by representatives of thirty-eight states, the Institute was presented as
an example of how universities can and must assist in strengthening
teaching in the nation's schools. In 1986, when the Institute held a
conference on "Strengthening Teaching Through Collaboration," Mr.
Hechinger said that "the list of participants in the conference showed
collaboration's rapid spread."2 In 1990 he wrote in <i>The New York
Times</i>
that the endowment of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute-the
result
of a highly creative $2 million challenge grant by the DeWitt Wallace
Reader's Digest Fund, which made the Institute the first collaborative
program of its type to be permanently established-marked the
beginning
of a "new era" in university-school relationships.3<p>
During the 1980s there was, as Mr. Hechinger's columns indicate, a
gratifying amount of attention to the Institute's work in New Haven and to
the growing movement for university-school collaboration, as well as the
opportunity for the Institute to assist other universities and schools in
the development of similar programs. Representatives of the Institute
were often asked to explain how school teachers could take from an
Institute seminar with a Yale faculty member something practical to use
in their own classrooms. The purpose of the present volume, then, is to
provide concrete examples of how several teachers of diverse subjects
and grade levels have used Institute seminars to develop materials for
their own teaching.</p>

<h4>Background</h4>
In 1980 two national panels issued their findings on the state of student
learning in the humanities and the sciences: a joint National Science
Foundation Department of Education study spoke of "a trend toward virtual
scientific and technological illiteracy" and the Commission on the
Humanities concluded that "a dramatic improvement in the quality of
education in our elementary and secondary schools is the highest
educational priority in the 1980s."4  The commission called for curricula
to teach children to read well, to write clearly, and to think critically.
They also found that "the need to interrelate the humanities, social
sciences, science and technology has probably never been greater than
today."5  These national problems in public education, further described
in
scores of subsequent studies and reports, are of concern to Yale as to
universities generally, and Yale's reasons for becoming involved in
seeking
solutions therefore transcended its sense of responsibility to the New
Haven community. As President Giamatti pointed out in an interview on
the David Susskind television program on December 7, 1980, "it is
profoundly in our self-interest to have coherent, well-taught, well
thought-out curricula" in our local schools and in secondary schools
throughout the country.<p>
Yale had acted on such a view as early as 1970, when the History
Department began the History Education Project (HEP), which assisted a
number of New Haven social studies teachers in developing improved
curricula for courses in American history, world area studies, and urban
studies. Although involving fewer than twenty teachers each year, the
History Education Project enjoyed a good reputation among school
teachers and with the administrations of the University and the Schools.
In 1977 the Secretary of the University, Henry Chauncey, Jr., then
responsible for Yale's community relations, called HEP "the most solid,
the most vital" educational link between Yale and New Haven. It provided,
in fact, one of the few occasions for the University and School
administrations to meet about a joint endeavor. HEP had been undertaken
with a grant from the American Historical Association (AHA), which until
1973 funded a number of such projects across the country. The New Haven
project was later continued with local and state support; and by 1977 it
was the only project the AHA had helped to establish that was still in
existence, its $10,000 annual budget provided in equal shares by the
University, the Schools, and New Haven's community foundation. There
was, thus, an eight-year record of a well-regarded relationship among
university faculty members and school teachers to which both institutions
had a financial commitment, albeit small.</p><p>
Perhaps most important, the participating school teachers and members of
the Yale History Department had discovered what they stood to gain from
working with each other. They became the nucleus of the groups that
planned the present Institute. They were persuasive, within the University
and the Schools, in enlisting administrative support. They also solicited
the interest of their colleagues in their own and other University and
School departments. Because of their previous collaborative experience
and their standing in their respective institutions, they were able to
convince their administrations and their teaching colleagues that such an
undertaking would be worthwhile and mutually advantageous.</p>

<h4>History</h4>
In these ways the success of HEP created favorable conditions for
planning a more ambitious and demanding program that would include
additional disciplines. For the administrations of Yale and the Schools,
the
earliest discussions in 1977 focused on which of the Schools' many needs
might be most usefully addressed by the University's resources. In what
areas did the Schools have significant needs and the University
complementary strengths? What was central enough to the mission of both
institutions to enable us to construct a real partnership of allies in
league
to improve our community's public schools? Which problems of the
Schools were recurring, and which University resources enduring, so that
the program might be of benefit to the Schools over the longer term?
These questions were addressed at a time of enormous pressures on the
budgets of Yale, the City, and the Schools. Even in better times,
financial
resources would never fully match our ambition to construct a highly
productive partnership. The overriding question was how we might
together apply limited resources in an intensive way where the need was
greatest.<p>
We explored these questions in the context of developing a proposal to the
National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) to expand the history
project, to include additional disciplines in the humanities, to increase
the number of teachers involved, and to make the new program more
rigorous. Since 1978 the NEH has provided indispensable support for the
Institute. The development of proposals to the NEH and others, in fact,
has
demonstrated that proposal writing itself has certain beneficial results:
it establishes a need to clarify and obtain agreement on objectives, and
it
imposes a deadline for making decisions.</p><p>
Teachers and administrators from the University and the Schools soon
reached a consensus: the relationship between the University and the
Schools must be both prominent and permanent within any viable larger
relationship between Yale and New Haven, and of the many ways Yale
might aid New Haven none is more natural than a program that shares
Yale's educational resources with the Schools. Because student needs
change, scholarship develops, and new educational policies are established
by the school system and each level of government, school curricula
undergo frequent revision and teachers are reassigned to teach subjects
they have not taught recently, or ever before. Because of Yale's strength
in
the academic disciplines, all agreed that the University could most
readily
aid the Schools by assisting in the further preparation of curricula and
teachers in the subjects they teach, and by helping teachers to keep
abreast of new developments in their fields.</p><p>
Our intent was therefore not to create new resources at Yale; rather, it
was to expand and institutionalize the work of University faculty
members with their colleagues in the Schools. Even at this early stage,
both Yale and the Schools sought a course of action that might have a
substantial impact. The Superintendent of Schools, Gerald N. Tirozzi, and
the Board of Education asked that the expansion of the program begin with
the addition of seminars in English, the subject in which they saw the
greatest need. The objective was eventually to involve as many teachers
as possible and to include a range of subjects that would span the
humanities and the sciences, so that the program might address school
curricula, and thus students' education, broadly.</p><p>
In 1978, then, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute was established as a
joint program of Yale University and the New Haven Public Schools,
designed to strengthen teaching and thereby to improve student learning in
the humanities and the sciences in our community's middle and high
schools. That year, the President of Yale, the Superintendent of Schools,
the Mayor of New Haven, and the Institute Director held a news conference
on the program. This was the first news conference held by a Yale
President and a New Haven Mayor in over a decade, and the only one in
memory that concerned public education in New Haven. At that time Mayor
Frank Logue commented that the Institute represents "a combined activity
that is in the mainstream of both our enterprises," not something made
"out of whole cloth."</p><p>
Since 1978 the Institute has benefited from a time of unusual harmony
and good will between the University and the Public Schools and the City
administration. Moreover, because it was founded well before the
widespread public attention that since 1983 has been paid to our nation's
public schools, it was not subjected to intense scrutiny before it could
begin to have sound evidence of the results of its program. Indeed, our
problem in the earliest years was in obtaining any public recognition at
all for teachers' work in the Institute.</p><p>
In September 1986, the new President of Yale, the new Mayor of New
Haven, the new Superintendent of Schools, and the Institute Director held
a news conference to accept the Teachers Institute's third grant from the
National Endowment for the Humanities. The announcement provided an
occasion, similar to the news conference in 1978, for President Benno C.
Schmidt, Jr., three days after his inaugural, to hold his first news
conference together with Mayor Biagio DiLieto and Superintendent of
Schools Dr. John Dow, Jr. Mayor DiLieto said then the Institute "is an
excellent illustration of the kind of cooperation that exists between the
City administration and Yale University, and it speaks well for our
efforts
to maintain that relationship at a very high level." Superintendent Dow
said that "the improvement of our school system can be directly related
to the kind of involvement that we have here." President Schmidt said that
"among the many ways in which Yale University seeks to be a good and
active citizen of New Haven, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is one
of our great successes."</p><p>
These are among the reasons why Yale announced in 1990 a plan to build an
adequate endowment for the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. By
endowing the Institute, we want to transform it into a permanent and
central function of a university which is committed to collaborating with
school teachers and to strengthening teaching and learning in local
schools and in schools across the country. We also want to affirm that
Yale believes that such collaboration is directly in its own
self-interest.
We hope that this may be influential with other institutions and schools.
At a time when universities across the country need to be more deeply
involved in strengthening teaching in schools, endowing the Institute
demonstrates one way for a faculty of arts and sciences to contribute
effectively to teachers' continuing education. We therefore intend to
encourage the permanent establishment of similar institutes at other
colleges and universties across the country.</p><p>
Since its founding in 1978 the Teachers Institute has become by far the
most comprehensive, intensive, and sustained collaboration of Yale
faculty members with public school teachers. Between 1978 and 1991 the
Institute has offered 88 different seminars in the arts and humanities,
the social sciences, mathematics, and the physical and life sciences.
Seventy-three Yale faculty members have given Institute talks and led one
or more seminars. More than 300 individual school teachers have
completed the program successfully from one to fourteen times. Through
the program, Fellows have developed 708 individual curriculum units
which are taught widely in school courses.</p>

<h4>The Annual Program</h4>
Teachers play a leading role in determining how the Institute can help
them meet the needs of all their students, not only those who later will
enter college. Each year as many as eighty New Haven school teachers of
English, history, foreign language, art, math, and science become Fellows
of the Institute to work with Yale faculty members on topics the teachers
themselves identify. The Institute does not involve a special group of
teachers who teach a special group of students; rather, it seeks to
involve
all teachers, grades 3 through 12, who can demonstrate the relationship of
their proposed Institute work to school courses they teach.<p>
Culminating with the Fellows' preparation of new materials that they and
other teachers will use in the coming school year, the Institute's annual
program lasts almost five months and includes talks, workshops, and
seminars. The talks are intended to stimulate thinking and discussion and
to point up interdisciplinary relationships in scholarship and teaching.
Presenting Institute guidelines for curriculum units, the workshops
explore the Fellows' own approaches to writing a curriculum unit and
stress the main audience for whom Fellows are writing: other teachers.
The Institute encourages Fellows to write their units in first
person-in
the voice of an experienced classroom teacher-addressing other
teachers
in and beyond the seminar. This extends the operation of collegiality
within the seminar to encompass other colleagues in the schools who
might adapt the units to their own teaching.</p><p>
As Thomas R. Whitaker describes in his introduction to the present
volume, the leader and Fellows in each seminar must face together the
challenge of balancing the teachers' further preparation in the seminar
subject with their development of teaching materials for school courses.
Thus, each seminar addresses the fundamental educational issue of the
connection between the teacher's preparation and students' learning. Our
experience with HEP taught us that this was something too vital to be left
to chance. We cannot simply assume that the teacher's new knowledge
will be conveyed to students. By requiring the writing of a curriculum
unit, we insist that teachers and their seminar leader examine together
how that knowledge can be effectively introduced to students in the
schools. The units themselves therefore mirror the collaborative nature of
the Institute, combining as they do both current knowledge of a field and
classroom experience. The Institute does not accept "auditors" or
teachers who are unwilling to write a curriculum unit. The teachers who
serve as Coordinators within each of the seminars follow the progress of
other Fellows in developing their units and meeting due dates; and any
Fellow who does not submit a finished curriculum unit is considered not
to have completed the program successfully.</p><p>
The materials that the Fellows write are compiled into a volume for each
seminar and deposited in school libraries throughout New Haven. As
compared with the loose-leaf files in which only one set of all materials
developed in the HEP were kept, Institute units contain an organized
approach to teaching a specific topic, bound with related essays, and
circulated widely to other teachers. Thus teachers' work is documented
and made available to many more teachers throughout the school system
over an extended period of time. The Institute in effect publishes the
units, providing all Fellows a type of professional opportunity not
ordinarily available to them. Seminar members and the teachers who serve
during nine months of the year as Representatives of the Institute for all
New Haven schools promote widespread use of these materials by their
colleagues.</p>

<h4>Results for Teachers and Students</h4>
Many evaluations have documented the efficacy of the Institute's approach
in increasing teachers' knowledge of their disciplines, enhancing their
professional morale and confidence in teaching the subjects they study
and the curricular material they prepare in the Institute, heightening
their
own self-fulfilling expectations of students' capacity to learn this
material, and encouraging them to remain in teaching in New Haven.&lt;+&gt;6
The curriculum units Institute Fellows write are used widely and
effectively by themselves and many other teachers, and students'
attention, motivation, and mastery are improved as a result.<p>
In fact, seventy percent of all teachers who have been Institute Fellows
are currently in teaching or administrative positions in the New Haven
Public Schools. Between 1986 and 1990, from forty-four to forty-eight
percent of Fellows each year said that the opportunity to participate in
the Institute had influenced their decision to remain in teaching in our
local public school system.</p>

<h4>Acknowledgments</h4>
We are grateful to numerous individuals and organizations who have made
possible the present volume. More than seventy-six local and national
foundations and corporations have provided gifts and grants
which-together with funding from Yale University and the New Haven
Public Schools-supported the Institute seminars offered since 1978
through which teachers wrote the original versions of the curriculum
units which are included here. Although a complete listing of these
sponsors appears in the appendix, I should credit in particular the
invaluable support which has been provided since 1978 by the National
Endowment for the Humanities for our work in the humanities, and since
1985 by the Carnegie Corporation of New York for our work in the
sciences. In addition, I especially want to acknowledge the role of the
Carnegie Corporation of New York in encouraging the Institute to
undertake the preparation of the present volume and in supporting its
editing, revision, and production. This volume was first released for
discussion at the December 1991 Yale Conference on "University-School
Collaboration: Preparing Teachers and Curricula for Public Schools," a
meeting of teachers and administrators from across the country made
possible by major support from the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund.
The material presented here, however, does not necessarily reflect the
views of the funding agencies.<p>
We were particularly fortunate that Thomas R. Whitaker, Frederick W.
Hilles Professor of English and Professor of Theater Studies, who has
himself led nine Institute seminars-greater than the number led by
any
other Yale faculty member-agreed to edit this volume and advise the
individual authors in the revision of their curriculum units. We
appreciate,
too, that in many cases the Yale faculty members who advised the
development of the original units conferred with the authors on updating
and extending the original statements of their teaching plans. Most
importantly, the authors themselves took the time during an unusually
demanding school year to undertake the process of revision for this
publication, in order to make their experience in the Institute more
widely
available to their colleagues in other communities across the country.</p><p>
This volume is the Institute's first venture in desktop publishing; four
individuals not only assisted in the production of the present book but
also increased the Institute's capacity to undertake similar projects in
the
future. Three of these individuals were Yale undergraduates employed by
the Institute during the summer of 1991: Adam W. Schnitzer designed the
book and laid out each page; Arthur K. Chung scanned the illustrations
which appear here and solved more than one computing problem that could
have stalled the whole project; Kimberly E. Kessler assisted by word
processing and proofreading several of the units. Erica C. Brossard,
Administrative Assistant in the Institute, worked in all the areas
mentioned above and completed the volume after summer's end. Janet
Russell, Senior Administrative Assistant in the Institute for more than
ten years, made the arrangements for printing this edition of the
book.<br/>
This volume, like the Institute itself, is therefore a collaboration among
many individuals with diverse responsibilities and backgrounds, each of
whose contributions was essential to the finished work. All were guided, I
believe, by the expectation that the curriculum units presented here will
make the school teacher's experience of participation in the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute more meaningful to our colleagues in other
institutions and schools. We further hope that it will add to their
understanding-as well as our own-something valuable about the
ways in
which public school teachers and university faculty members can work
together through such an Institute, as they face in common the challenge
of strengthening teaching and learning in an urban community's public
schools.</p>
