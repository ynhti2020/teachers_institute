<hr/> <a name="a"> Stories of racial tension and
racial violence abound in the news. The controversy over forced
desegregation and busing is again getting top billing in the newspapers.
Should the United States government legislate desegregation? Is racial
mixing desirable and/or necessary in our educational system? As a teacher
I feel that these issues must be brought into the classroom in such a way
that students can understand the different positions and can figure out
their opinions. For adolescents, learning to work wi th and relate to
people of all different backgrounds are important skills. For urban
children, racial questions are of immediate concern. Schools are a major
focal point for them. For this reason, I have chosen to study the history
of school desegregation
legislation with my students.
<p>
This unit has been organized for students with a high school reading
level. Since 1982, when I prepared it, it has been used as a segment of a
course at the High School in the Community, an inner city magnet high
school which is teacher run and very suppo rtive to teacher initiated
curriculum. I first used the unit as the history half of an
interdisciplinary course in English and history. The English component
focused on forming opinions and writing essays. The class meet daily for
three hours. I have sinc e used this unit in conjunction with other
subjects such as statistics and poll making, drama in the courtroom, and
philosophy as reflected in various legal systems throughout history. Since
this course has proven to be very stimulating for the students, I have
also expanded it into a larger course on the American Legal System.</p><p>
Although I have planned this course for a particular context, I feel that
both the material content and the format can be applied in many other
school settings. This course has stimulated student interest in history,
current events and the power of the American legal system. Using primary
sources such as legal documents, newspaper and magazine articles, and
autobiographical essays, students are exposed to many different points of
view. They learn that history is alive and powerful in their world. The
legal system works with decisions made in the past, applies them to the
present and then reshapes the future. The students in these classes have
found that they really enjoyed studying and debating the legal issues that
I have raised as they pertain to many different aspects of American life
today. </p>

<h3>Introduction: The Significance of <i>Brown v. The Board of
Education, Topeka, Kansas</i></h3>
The Supreme Court decision in <i>Brown v. The Board of Education of
Topeka,
Kansas</i> has been credited with much significance. For some, it signaled
the
start of the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, while for
others, it represented the fall of segregation. Even in the footnotes of
the decision, however, the Court raised questions as to how much authority
it had and how to proceed toward getting compliance. In the brief summary
of events that follows, I have drawn primarily from Kluger’s study,
<i>Simple
Justice.</i> 
<p>
The Brown decision was a landmark because it overturned the legal policies
established by the <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> decision that legalized the
practices of “separate but equal”. In the Plessy decision, the 14th
Amendment was interpreted in such a way that e quality in the law could be
met through segregated facilities. Jim Crow laws were passed throughout
the South and they established separate facilities for Blacks and Whites
in everything from schools to restrooms, drinking fountains to witness
stands in courtrooms.</p><p>
For many years, the Civil Rights movement during the first 50 years of the
20th Century accepted this policy of “separate but equal” in its struggle
for access into the society. It fought in many communities for equal pay
for teachers and for equal school facilities. It fought for equal
libraries, recreational facilities, and health services. Plessy defined
the terms of the struggle.</p><p>
The Brown decision came about after a series of Supreme Court decisions on
specific educational challenges. The first was that universities must
admit Blacks to graduate facilities if a desired course of study was not
available in a Black institution. Then in <i>Sipuel v. Board of Regents of
the University of Oklahoma,</i> in 1948, the Court ruled that Blacks must
be
admitted to state universities because they offered many opportunities not
available in Black institutions. In 1950 in <i>Sweatt v. Painter,</i> the
Court
ruled that a separate Black law school, established for Sweatt after he
sued for admission to the University of Texas Law School, was unequal not
only in physical facilities and curriculum but in reputation and
opportunity for stimulating professional contact. In <i>Laurin v. Oklahoma
State Regents,</i> also in 1950, the Court ruled that the state violated
the
“separate but equal” doctrine when it required isolated cafeteria and
classroom seating for Black students because it produced unequal
educational opport unity.</p><p>
The <i>Brown</i> decision established that separate schools were ipso
facto
unequal. It allowed proponents for better opportunities for Blacks to
fight for positive gains and full equality. But the fact that there were
few means to implement these decisions became clear as it became obvious
that few gains were being seen by 1960, the year that a new student Civil
Rights movement was founded.</p><p>
Immediately after the Brown decision, many attempts were made to begin
desegregation. NAACP chapters encouraged Black parents to send their
children to “White” schools, and there had been retaliation against those
who did. There had also been three mass marches on Washington on the
school issue. On May 18, 1957, the anniversary of the Brown decision,
about 35,000 attended a prayer pilgrimage for integrated schools sponsored
by both northern and southern civil rights leaders, a first joint effort.
In 1959,
400,000 signatures were presented to Congressman Charles Diggs
petitioning the President and Congress for a program to insure the orderly
and speedy integration of schools.</p><p>
The legal struggle for integrated schools dragged on in the years
following the Brown decision. Southern school boards and state governments
brought suit after suit challenging it and then created a variety of ways
to get around the intent of the decision. In those few localities where
there was at least minimum compliance, intimidation and violence were used
to keep the White schools White.</p><p>
Nevertheless, the Brown decision did provide a setting for major
confrontations between the federal government and the states, and between
the Black and White populations of several Southern cities. Anthony Lewis,
a reporter for <i>The New York Times,</i> in a study of school
desegregation,
pointed out that there were rapid steps taken toward desegregation in
Kansas, Arizona, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. In 1954, 1955, and 1956
hundreds of school districts began to abandon racially segregated school
classes.  But then reaction seemed to set in and most Southern political
leaders began to take defensive positions.</p><p>
There were many examples of this reaction. In Clinton, Tennessee, the
school board and other White citizens faced down a mod in 1956. The high
school was bombed in 1958. In 1956 the presence of Autherine Lucy set off
rioting at the University of Alabama so the University officials asked her
to withdraw. The federal government did not respond to the University’s
request for aid. In 1962, James Meredith entered the University of
Mississippi despite serious rioting. In this case President Kennedy had
sent in
federal troops. This event was publicized throughout the world. Another
shocking reaction was that of Prince Edward County. There, the public
schools were closed down for 5 years, from 1959 to 1964. This county in
Virginia closed their schools rather than desegregating them. The schools
were not reopened until the Supreme Court ruled that they had to be
reopened. 1700 Black school children had no schooling from 1959 until 1963
when a Free School was opened. It remained open until June, 1964, when the
county was forced to operate public schools again.</p><p>
Little Rock, Arkansas, was the site of a confrontation of major
significance to the future of changing racial attitudes. The whole world
read about the 15 year old Black child who was turned away from the Little
Rock Central High School by the National Guardsmen into a mob of screaming
White people. They were screaming, “Lynch her, lynch her!”</p><p>
This short history raises some important questions for Americans still
today. Our schools are still by and large not integrated—and probably not
even desegregated. All over America people are calling for “quality”
education and “neighborhood schools” rather than for forced integration.
Today few people say that “separate but equal” is legally acceptable but
de facto segregation has again become a reality.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
I have five objectives for this unit.  <p> The <i>first</i> objective is
to show
students that racial issues can be discussed openly. By giving them
exposure to an historical approach to the crucial aspect of American life,
I want them to learn to articulate their ideas and share them in class.</p><p>
The<i> second</i> objective is to show students how decisions made by the
Supreme
Court on the constitutionality of lower court decisions can directly
influence people’s lives.</p><p>
The <i>third</i> objective is to teach students that historical times
shape people’s ideas and behavior.</p><p>
The <i>fourth</i> objective is to teach students how to use primary
sources for understanding history.</p><p>
The <i>fifth</i> objective is to expose students to the methods used to
shape
legal thinking and argumentation.</p>

<h3>Strategies</h3>
Primary sources will be used extensively in this class. 
<p>
Understanding them and interpreting their meaning in different historical
contexts will help students see how history shapes thinking and influences
people’s lives. Each week one primary source will be read, summarized and
discussed in class. Background information will be added through readings
from a text book, <i>These United States,</i> and from lectures in class.
Each
Friday there will be a quiz given and students will be asked to interpret
the significance of the primary source. During the final week, the
students will be asked to take a position on a topic which had been
discussed in class and present their argument to the class orally and in
essay form. Here is an outline of the weeks:</p>

</a></dt></dl><h3><a name="e">Week 1: The 14th Amendment</a></h3><a name="e">
This week’s work will focus around reading and understanding the 14th
Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In this amendment, all
citizens of the United States, either by birth or naturalization, are
assured <i>equal protection of the law.</i> No person can hold office if
they
have engaged in a rebellion against the federal government. The government
is not responsible for debts accrued by state governments during a
rebellion—this includes the costs involved in the loss of emancipated
slaves. It is also clearly stated that the Congress shall have the power
to enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation. 
<p>
We will also look into the distinctions made between the three post-Civil
War Amendments. While the 13th abolished slavery and the 15th established
the right to suffrage, it was the 14th which was to guarantee civil
rights. The stipulations of section 1 of the 14th Amendment left much of
the jurisdictional issues vague as to the limits of federal and state
laws. (So for example, it was not until the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that
housing was brought under the jurisdiction of this amendment.)</p><p>
This amendment consolidated the power of the radical Republicans in the
South. By protecting the rights of Black Americans they hoped to keep them
loyal to the Republican Party and the newly formed federal government.
However, the amendment has been interpreted in contradictory ways—to
legislate both segregation and integration. By granting Blacks and Whites
equality in the eyes of the law, the 14th Amendment undermined the Black
Codes in the South passed during reconstruction and reasserted the right
of the federal government to intercede if states blocked their rights.</p><p>
The signing of the 14th Amendment became a requirement for reentry into
the Union after the Civil War. It consolidated the power of the Northern
states and the Republicans. But their power was soon undermined as the
southern states started passing new segregation laws and the advent of Jim
Crow policies again denied Blacks equal rights and opportunities.</p><p>
Students will also be assigned readings in the school American History
textbook for background information on this.</p>

</a></dt></dl><h3><a name="f">Week 2: <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> and Justice Harlan’s
Dissent</a></h3><a name="f">
This week we concentrate on the <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> case and Justice
Harlan’s dissent. These documents may be found Gerald Gunther’s book,
<i>Cases and Materials on Constitutional Law.</i> In this decision the
Supreme
Court decided that “separate but equal” accommodations for Whites and
Colored railroad passengers did not violate the rights established in the
14th Amendment. Justice Brown gave the majority decision and he explained
that although the Amendment was “undoubtedly to enforce the absolute
equality of the two races before the law, it could not legislate the
abolition of all distinctions. Laws requiring the separation of the races
simply reflected the culture of the people and as long as facilities were
equal they were not prejudicial”. Separation need not imply inferiority of
either race. Brown did not feel that social prejudice could be overcome by
legislation: “If the two races are to meet upon terms of social equality,
it must be the result of natural affinities, a mutual appreciation of each
other’s
merits, and a voluntary consent of individuals.” <p> On July 19, 1890,
the Louisiana General Assembly passed an act that provided equal but
separate accommodations for each race for the comfort of all the
passengers. The law was denounced by the American Citizen’s Equal Rights
Association of Louisiana Against Class Legislation. This group of
well-to-do Blacks raised money and challenged the constitutionality of the
law. But it was not until Adolph Plessy entered a train and sat in a “For
Whites” car that a test case was brought to the Supreme Court. The
presiding Judge, Judge Ferguson, of the Criminal District Court of New
Orleans found the law constitutional as did the Louisiana Supreme Court.
The case was heard in the Supreme Court in 1896. During this period many
new Jim Crow laws had been passed throughout the South. Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, and Tennessee passed laws requiring railroads to separate the
races. Mississippi and South Carolina already denied the vote to Blacks
and many other states were preparing to take the same steps. </p><p>
There were real differences of opinion within the Black community over
these rulings. On one side were those Blacks who felt that they must
adjust to the growing sentiment against their civil rights by developing
the economic standing of Blacks before working for equal rights. So Booker
T. Washington delivered a speech at the Atlanta Exposition in 1895
stating: “In all things that are purely social, we can be as separate as
the fingers, yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual
progress. The opportunity to earn a dollar in a factory just now is worth
infinitely more than the opportunity to spend a dollar in an opera house.”
He urged Blacks to become experts in various economic positions so that
the Black man could win a place in the White man’s world.</p><p>
On the other hand, W.E.B. DuBois argued for full, legal equality
immediately. He felt that Washington’s position relocated Blacks to half
manhood—a worker with no civil rights. Thus he led the Niagra Movement
which declared, “We want full manhood suffrage
and we want it now.” This organization grew into the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP), the organization which led
the struggle against segregated schools and for civil rights for
Blacks.</p><p>
Seven Justices ruled against Plessy, but one, Justice Harlan, dissented.
He asserted that justice should be color blind and that the enforcement of
“separate but equal” interferes with the personal freedoms of individuals
by legally forcing separation. As
he stated, “Sixty million whites are in no danger from the presence of
eight millions of Blacks . . . The destinies of the two races in this
country are indissolubly linked together, and the interest of both require
that the common government of all shall not permit the seeds of race hate
to be planted under the sanction of law.” He foresaw that the decision
would lead to a pattern of behavior which would be very dangerous and
undermine a basic sense of justice.</p>

</a></dt></dl><h3><a name="g">Week 3: Living with Jim Crow</a></h3><a name="g">
The two readings for this week are about Jim Crow legislation and how it
felt to live within these restrictions. In the excerpt from <i>The Strange
Case of Jim Crow,</i> C. Vann Woodward discusses the expansion of
“separate
but equal” legislation throughout the South. After quoting a Southern
critic of the policy who pointed out the absurdity of the legislation, he
reviews the major restrictions passed in this period. These laws
restricted travel, housing, use of private and public facilities,
amusement parks and other recreational areas, and of course schools and
institutions of higher learning. 
<p>
The second reading is an excerpt from Richard Wright’s <i>Uncle Tom’s
Children.</i> In “The Ethics of Living Jim Crow”, Wright describes how he
learned to live with the double standards implied by “separate but equal.”
Out of fear for her son’s life, Richard’s mother beats him for standing up
to White children. He learned the same lesson when he tried to assert his
rights on his job—he wanted to learn information which certain White
workers felt was not his place to learn. This autobiographical sketch is
an excellent introduction to the consequences of Jim Crow legislation and
attitudes.</p>

</a></dt></dl><h3><a name="h">Week 4: <i>Brown V. The Board of Education of Topeka,
Kansas</i></a></h3><a name="h">
During this week we will study the <i>Brown</i> decision of 1954 and the
reaction
of a group of dissenting Southern congressmen. In this decision the
Supreme Court concluded that in the field of education, the doctrine of
“separate but equal” was unacceptable. Segregation is a denial of equal
protection of the laws as defined in the 14th Amendment. 
<p>
After hearing a series of cases brought on behalf of Black students in
segregated schools, the Court reviewed the circumstances surrounding the
adoption of the 14th Amendment. This research proved inconclusive because
it was clear that each side of the ratification debate had different
goals. The proponents wanted to eliminate all legal distinctions while
opponents wanted to limit the applicability of the Amendments.</p><p>
They found, however, that after reviewing the history of public education
since the ratification of the Amendment, they had a basis upon which to
declare “separate but equal” legislation unconstitutional. Education is
one of the most important functions of government. Compulsory education
and public expenditures for education demonstrate this importance. The
right to a good, equal education was fundamental to our democratic
society. They thus asked the question, “Does segregation of children in
public schools solely on the basis of race, even though the physical
facilities and other ‘tangible’ factors may be equal, deprive the children
of the minority group of equal educational opportunities?” Their answer
was clear and unequivocal—”We believe it does.” Separate educational
facilities are inherently unequal.</p><p>
This decision came at the culmination of a series of court cases
challenging segregated schools. Initially, the NAACP fought against
segregated graduate school facilities. In this case, however, the
plaintiffs were Black children of elementary school age residing in
Topeka, Kansas. This action was brought to the United States District
Court for the District of Kansas to enjoin the enforcement of a Kansas
statute which permits but does not require cities of more than 15,000
population to maintain separate school facilities for Black and White
students. Based on that authority, the Board of Education of Topeka
elected to establish segregated elementary schools. Other public schools
were run on a nonsegregated basis. The three judge District Court found
that
segregated public schools had a detrimental effect upon Black children,
but denied relief because they found that the schools were essentially
equal with respect to buildings, curriculum, transportation, and the
educational qualifications of teachers.</p><p>
Other related District Court decisions were <i>Briggs v. Elliott</i> in
South
Carolina, <i>Davis v. County School Board</i> in Virginia, and in
Delaware,
<i>Gebhart v. Belton.</i> In Briggs v. Elliott and the <i>Davis v. County
School
Board,</i> the Courts ordered that the schools be equalized, having
established that the facilities and curriculum were unequal. In Delaware,
however, after recognizing that the Black schools were inferior with
respect to teacher training, pupil-teacher ratio, extra-curricular
activities, physical plant, and time and distance of travel, the Court
ordered immediate admission of Black plaintiffs into previously all White
schools. It should be noted that although the Chancellor of the Delaware
Court maintained that segregation itself resulted in an inferior education
for Black children, he did not base his decision on this finding.</p><p>
A group of Southern politicians declared their feelings about the <i>Brown
v. 
Board of Education </i>decision in the Southern Manifesto, the second
reading
for this week. Essentially they declared that it represents a clear abuse
of judicial power. They felt that the federal judiciary was encroaching on
the rights of the people. Education has not been mentioned in the
Constitution nor in the 14th Amendment or any other amendment. They felt
that this action would destroy the amicable relationship between the White
and Black races that had been created over the last century. Forcing the
races to change their relationship could only produce misunderstanding and
hostility. </p>

</a></dt></dl><h3><a name="i">Week 5: Working for Desegregated Schools</a></h3><a name="i">
As stated in the introduction, the Brown decision has been seen by some as
a turning point. In any case, the decision produced some earthshaking
events in the United States. The struggle for desegregated schools and
then general civil rights turned out to
be a painful one, both physically and mentally. During this week two
short excerpts about the early attempts at desegregation will be read.
<p>
The first is a brief description of the events leading up to the school
desegregation in Little Rock, Arkansas written by Daisy Bates, the
president of the state NAACP. In this section of her book, <i>Thee Long
Shadow of Little Rock,</i> she describes how it came to pass that one
Black
school child was refused entrance to the high school because of the
presence of National Guardsmen.</p><p>
It first appeared that Little Rock would join many other moderate cities
in the south and desegregate their schools with relatively little
difficulty. Nine Black students were chosen to attend the formerly all
White high school in September, 1957. However, Governor Faubus called out
the National Guard to prevent the children from attending the school. This
caused a clash between state and federal powers. In reaction to Faubus’
acts, President Eisenhower had to call federal troops to force
desegregation. B lack students attended the high school under guard for
the year 1957-1958. The following year the schools were closed. The next
year, however, the schools were opened on a desegregated basis. The whole
world watched these events on television. </p><p>
In the second reading students will learn how a psychiatrist recorded the
effects of forced desegregation on the children who fought the struggle.
Robert Coles studied these children in his book, <i>Farewell to the
South</i>.
Both Black and White children and their parents were affected by these
changes. Children seemed to adjust easily and quickly to each other if
left to explore together. They did not, however, remain unaffected by the
crowds of yelling adults and the presence of soldiers. In Coles’ essay,
“In
the South These Children Prophesy”, he reviews the experiences of a few
children and gives a real personal touch by adding his feelings and
observations.</p>

</a></dt></dl><h3><a name="j">Week 6: Busing and Forced Desegregation: I Believe</a></h3><a name="j">
In this, the final week, we will work on shaping the students’ opinions.
Before working on position papers, the class will be asked to read a
recent article from <i>The New York Times,</i> “Rulings on School
Integration Key
Target for Conservatives”. Today, almost twenty years after the
<i>Brown</i>
decision, many of the same issues are still being debated and legislated.
In this article, the reporter discusses the recent take-over by
conservatives of control of the executive branch and the Senate and their
growing influence in the House of Representatives. They are attacking the
Federal Courts for intruding into the basic fabric of American life by
making decisions which these conservatives claim are beyond their
jurisdiction. The management of school desegregation through busing is
their favorite target. Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North Carolina, was the
first school system ordered desegregated by the use of busing. It is cited
as a successful example. Boston, Mass. is presented as a city whose
designs for school desegregation by busing have only produced a more tense
and segregated school system. At least part of the cause has to do with
“white flight”, an issue viewed from many different perspectives. Some
feel that busing causes more problems than it solves. This article raises
many of the issues raised throughout the course—and brings the debate up
to date.
<p>
It should be noted that updating should be a continuous process for this
course. So, for example, I found an excellent article that brought up the
same debates but now in 1991. In January, 1991, the Supreme Court once
again limited its jurisdiction in school desegregation cases. This was
reported on the front page of <i>The New York Times</i> on January 16,
1991.</p><p>
During this week students will be asked to choose a topic relevant to the
issues discussed in this course and to present both oral and written
position papers. I will distribute a list of topics and a form which will
help the students organize their thoughts and show them how to complete
the assignment. The list of topics will be drawn from in class discussions
and readings. </p>
<h4>Week 6: Assignments (in class / homework)</h4>

<h3>Sample Lesson Plans</h3>
<h4>Week 2: Writing a summary: <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i> and Justice
Harlan’s
Dissent</h4>
Answer these questions carefully and with full sentences. Then write a
brief summary of the two documents.
<dl>
<dt>
<i>I. 	Plessy v. Ferguson</i>
<dl><dt>
What does the 13th Amendment state?
</dt><dt> 	 According to Justice Brown and the majority opinion:
<dl>
<dt> 	 a. separation does not imply inferiority (explain in your own
words),
</dt><dt>	 b. separation is generally within the competency of the state
legislatures in the exercise of power (explain in your own words). Give
three examples listed in which state legislation has sustained
separation.</dt></dl>
</dt><dt>  Define reasonable malice power as it is stated in the decision.
</dt><dt>  What is the underlying fallacy of the plaintiff’s argument?
</dt><dt>  Define inferiority.
</dt><dt>  Define natural affinities.
</dt><dt>  Define voluntary consent.
</dt><dt>Explain this statement: “(Legislation) is powerless to eradicate
racial
instincts or to abolish distinctions based upon physical differences, and
the attempt to do so can only result in accentuating the difficulties of
the present situation.”
</dt><dt>When was this decision made and what was Mr. Plessy complaining
about?
</dt><dt>Write a brief summary.</dt></dl>
</dt><dt>	II. 	Justice Harlan’s Dissent<dl>
<dt>  Who is Justice Harlan?
</dt><dt> What is a dissent?
</dt><dt> What is Harlan’s fundamental objection to the decision?
</dt><dt>  What is Harlan’s view of legal distinctions based on racial
considerations?
</dt><dt>  What does he feel will be the consequences of this decision?
</dt><dt>  Write a brief summary.
</dt></dl></dt></dl>
<h4>Week 2: Form for note taking in class</h4>
<dl><dt>
<i>Separate but equal:</i>
</dt><dt><i>Jim Crow legislation:</i>
</dt><dt>Rapid change of status for Blacks in the South after the Civil War.
<dl>
<dt>  Antebellum South
</dt><dt>  Reconstruction
</dt><dt>  Carpetbaggers
</dt><dt>  Plantations
</dt><dt>  Industrialization
</dt><dt>  Urbanization
</dt></dl>
</dt><dt>Mr. Plessy takes a train ride.
<dl><dt>
Judge Ferguson’s decision on Louisiana
</dt></dl>

<dl>
<dt>  Booker T. Washington
</dt><dt>  W.E.B. DuBois
</dt></dl>
</dt><dt>Dissent as a concept.
</dt><dt>Justice Harlan’s Dissent seems to foresee the problems with the
“separate but equal” doctrin.
</dt></dl>
<i>Consider these questions so we can discuss them in class:</i>
<dl><dt>Does separate but equal necessarily imply inferiority?
</dt><dt>How can equal facilities be determined?
</dt><dt>Should the government make rules that tell people how to live or make
rules that reflect how they do live? 
</dt></dl><h4>Week 6: My position paper—Outline form</h4>
<i>Title:</i><p>
<i>I believe:</i> (State clearly and precisely your opinion about the
issue.)</p>
<dl><dt><i>Reason 1:</i> (You can give as many reasons as you would like

support your thoughts but there must be at least three.)
</dt></dl>
<i>Conclusion:</i> <p> This is to be presented orally in class and written
