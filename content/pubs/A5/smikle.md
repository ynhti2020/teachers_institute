<h3>I. Introduction</h3>
Today’s mathematics curricula and education goals should reflect the
importance of mathematical literacy. Therefore this unit will attempt to
reflect some of these new directions both in the content and the method of
teaching. 
<p>
The new direction can be summarized in the following statements:1</p>
<dl><dt>Students should learn the value of mathematics.
</dt><dt>To reduce math anxiety, students should become more confident in their abilities to do the subject.
</dt><dt>Students should become more confident and develop skills as mathematic problem solvers.
</dt><dt>Students learn to communicate and reason mathematically.
</dt><dt>Students should be able to think of diverse ways to solve a problem.
</dt></dl>
The mathematics curriculum should also reflect the mathematical needs of
the next decade. Today’s students will be working with tools and in an
environment that will need an understanding of more complex thinking
skills. Teachers and curriculum planners must understand and anticipate
the changing needs of industries and the society.<p>
Henry Pollak2 (1987) summarized the mathematical needs and expectations
for employers in the industrial sector of the future.</p>
</a><dl><a name="a"><dt>1. The ability to set up problems with the appropriate operations.
</dt><dt>2. Knowledge of a variety of techniques to approach and work on problems.
</dt><dt>3. Understanding the underlying mathematical features of a problem
</dt><dt>4. The ability to work with others on a problem.
</dt><dt>5. The ability to see the applicability of mathematical ideas to common and complex problems.
</dt><dt>6. Preparation for open problem situation since most real life problems are not well formulated.
</dt></a><dt><a name="a">7. The belief in the utility and the value of mathematics.

<h3>II. Rationale and General Objectives of the Unit</h3>
The study of aerodynamics has assisted in providing the world with the
most efficient mode of transportation. As a result of these achievements a
large industry has arisen that needs to be kept supplied with qualified
personnel both skilled and unskilled. 
<p>
Most of the high school curriculum today has placed great emphasis on the
four-year-college-bound student; but there is a growing demand for workers
who are literate in mathematics in all sectors of the society.</p><p>
This unit in aerodynamics will attempt to find the mathematical concepts
that are essential to flight with special interest in the concepts that
relate to path problems.</p><p>
The development of this unit will be justified by the emphasis placed on
making mathematics relevant, practical and meaningful to the student, thus
providing them with answers to “Why do I need to do this?” or “Where in
the real world would I ever use this?”</p><p>
The theme behind the development of this unit is to present mathematical
concepts that are not usually taught in the curriculum of students that
are labeled low achievers, and to present these topics using flight as the
major focus.</p><p>
It has been a challenge to teach students in the lower mathematics
classes. These students have been accustomed to failing the traditional
topics such as fractions and decimals; and in high school they find
mathematics difficult, boring and impractical. They have been kept out of
the mainstream of mathematics because of their inability to pass the
proficiency tests.</p><p>
In my quest to present these students with mathematics concepts that would
otherwise be outside their curriculum, I have attempted to present these
topics differently by relating them directly to flight, thus forging a
connection between the historical concepts and some of the mathematics
that can be applied to it.</p><p>
The teaching approach would be to expose these students to the readings of
the historical development. This could be done as a class project or
individual students could do research on different areas. The mathematical
concepts could be introduced from the view point of students planning a
flight in an aircraft then considering the logistics of the flight.
Navigation, and spherical geometry could be applied here with the theme:
“Planning a Journey.”</p><p>
The introduction of graph theory could be introduced as a tool to solving
problems that relate to the activities that present themselves during the
flight: loading and unloading the aircraft; the job activities of the air
hostess; even the time line of activities for passengers. Students could
brainstorm and develop their own problems.</p><p>
I share the beliefs presented in the Mathematics Standards prepared by the
N.T.C.M.,3 that mathematics should be made relevant, that its application
should be shown across subject areas, and that all students can be
successful in mathematics.</p>
<h4>General Objectives of the Unit</h4>
The unit will be designed to help students:
</a><dl><a name="b"><dt>a) To acquire knowledge about the historical development of the
industry.
</dt><dt>b) To develop the ability to apply their knowledge in math to the task
of problem solving. 
</dt><dt>c) To apply specific graphing skills to solving problems.
</dt><dt>d) To use Graph Theory to solve problems related to paths.
</dt></a><dt><a name="b">e) Introduce students to Spherical Geometry as a link between Geography and Geometry.

<h4>A. Developments before the Wright Brothers</h4>
Men had always wondered why it was impossible for them to attain the art
of flying. They questioned the ability of birds to fly. As a result of
their fascination for flying, stories of man’s ability to fly have been
embedded in the Greek myths of Daedalus
and his son, Icarus.
<p>
The stories were centered around his escape from the island of Crete where
he was imprisoned. They described how they fastened wings with wax to
their bodies and flew through the air; Icarus flew too near the sun, the
wax melted and he fell to his death in the sea.</p><p>
Man’s idea about flying was thus centered on the imitation of birds; as a
result various medieval people fastened wings to their bodies and tried to
fly. Many fell to their most unfortunate fates.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Finally men gave up the idea of strapping a pair of wings to their bodies
to enable them to fly. It was replaced by the concept of wings which were
flapped up and down by some mechanical mechanism. Powered by some type of
human arm, leg or some other body
movement. These were the ornithopters.</p><p>
Leonardo da Vinci designed a number of these. Above is a sketch of his
ornithopter.5</p><p>
Ornithopters did not accomplish any successful flight; therefore they made
no contribution to the advancement of flight.</p><p>
It was not until November 21, 1783 that human efforts to fly were
accomplished. This was done when the balloon flown by the Marquis
d’Ariandes went up in the air and flew 5 miles to Paris.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
This balloon was inflated and buoyed up by hot air coming from a fire
beneath it.</p><p>
The Montgolfier brothers thought of the lifting power of hot air and its
ability to lift a person from the earth. They experimented with different
materials (bags made with linen in which hot air was trapped). They had
several public demonstrations and fi nally the flight of November 1783.</p><p>
The flight served its purpose by triggering the public’s interest in the
ability of man to fly.</p><p>
It was not until the advent of Sir George Casley (1773-1857) that the
concept to include a fixed wing for generating lift and a separate
mechanism for propulsion was originated. He envisioned paddles and a
horizontal and vertical tail for stability. These
ideas were inscribed on a silver disc.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
With these ideas Cayley introduced the concept that lift was different
from propulsion and therefore set the stage for the developments that took
place later.</p><p>
He devoted a life of study to aerodynamics. In 1804 he built a whirling
arm apparatus for testing airfoils; this was a lifting surface mounted on
the end of a long rod, which was rotated at some speed to generate a flow
of air over the airfoils. This is analogous to the wind tunnels today. It
was an important development because it allowed the measurement of
aerodynamic forces and the center of pressure on the lifting surface.
These developments can be considered the first step in aerodynamic
testing.</p><p>
In 1804 he designed, built and flew a small model glider.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
He documented his developments in a paper entitled “On Aerial Navigation.”
This was published in 1809. In 1849 he built and tested a full size
airplane by which a ten year old boy was carried along and lifted several
meters from the ground.</p><p>
He had the concept of stacking several wings on top of each other
(biplanes and triplanes); he had the fear that a single wing would fail.
This idea was carried down into the twentieth century. It was only in the
1930s that the monoplane became the dominant airplane configuration.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
It was sometime in 1853 that Cayley built and flew the world’s first
human-carrying glider. The configuration is unknown; it could have been a
triplane and looked like the boy carrier.</p><p>
After Cayley’s death in 1857, not many inventions took place for the next
fifty years.</p>
<h4>Other landmark discoveries</h4>
William Samuel Henson (1812-1888): he published a design for a fixed wing
airplane powered by a steam engine driving two propellers. This was called
the aerial steam carriage. 
<p>
This design was a direct result of Cayley’s ideas and research in
aeronautics.</p><p>
John Stringfellow, a friend of Henson, built several small steam engines
and attempted to power some model monoplanes off the ground. He was not
very successful. His most recognized work appeared in the form of a steam
powered triplane. His triplane was the main bridge between Cayley’s work
and modern aeronautics.</p><p>
Felix Du Temple (1857-1858) flew the first successful powered model
airplane. It was a monoplane; it had wings and was powered by
clockwork.</p><p>
The second airplane (1874) had the first powered takeoff by a piloted full
sized airplane. It had wings and was powered by hot air engine. The
machine was launched down an inclined plane.</p><p>
Alexander F. Mozhaiski was a Russian; in July 1884 he designed an aerial
steam carriage. It was launched down a ski ramp and flew for a few
seconds.</p><p>
These attempts did not satisfy the criteria of sustained flight, but could
be considered assisted powered takeoffs.</p>
<h4>B. The age of the glider</h4>
Otto Lilienthal was one of the giants in aeronautical engineering. He
designed and flew the first successful controlled glider in history. 
<p>
Because of his interest in flight, he studied the structure and types of
birds’ wings and applied this information to the design of mechanical
flight.</p><p>
In 1889 and again in 1890, he designed and flew gliders, but both were
unsuccessful. In 1891 he had his first successful glider flight from a
hill in Germany.</p><p>
The general configuration of this monoplane glider was one of a birdlike
platform of the wing. He used chambered airfoil shape on the wing and used
vertical and horizontal tail planes in the back for stability. These
machines are the forerunners of the hangliders today. Flight control was
exercised by shifting one’s center of gravity.</p><p>
Lilienthal can be classified as an airman in contrast to those who were
called chauffeurs. The distinction was drawn between those who were
concerned with thrust and lift, and the airmen who were concerned with
flight in the air.</p><p>
Lilienthal made about 2000 successful glider flights. His aerodynamic data
were widely read. He died during a glider flight in Germany on August 9,
1896.</p><p>
Percy Pilcher studied with Lilienthal and under his guidance made several
glides. He could be classified as an airman; he understood the need for
understanding natural flight, before engaging in machine powered flights.
He built a machine called the Hawk in 1896. It was powered by a 4 hp
engine weighing 40 lbs. He died while flying this machine.</p>
<h4>C. Aeronautics in the United States</h4>
Most of the advances that had been made in heavier than air flying
machines were made in Britain and in Europe. These developments were
taking place during the time when the United States was more concerned
with land expansion and the consolidation of a new government;
aeronautical developments had no impact.<p>
This interest in flying was taken by Octave Chanute (1832-1910). He
collected and studied all the aeronautical information available. He later
published his book Progress in Flying Machines. In his book he summarized
all the important progress in aviation. He could be considered the first
aviation historian.</p><p>
He designed hang gliders and produced a biplane glider. He bridged the gap
between Stringfellow’s triplane and the successful powered flights of
1903.</p><p>
Samuel Pierpont Langley (1834-1906) designed and built a series of powered
aircrafts, which resulted in piloted flights in 1903.</p><p>
Langley followed in the tradition of Cayley and therefore built a large
whirling arm, powered by a steam engine. This he used to make tests on
steam airfoils.</p><p>
In 1896 Langley was successful when one of powered models made a free
flight of 3300 ft and later another flew over 3/4 mile. These
“Aerodromes,” as he called them, were tandem winged vehicles, driven by
two propellers between the wings that were powered by a 1 hp steam
engine.</p><p>
After studying Stringfellow’s work he set out to design a better engine.
In 1898, the war department commissioned him to build a machine for
passengers. He decided that a gasoline fueled engine would be best for use
on an aircraft. A 52.4 hp engine result ed from his efforts. He used a 3.2
hp gasoline fueled engine to have a successful flight with a 1/4 scale
model. With this encouragement he started to design a full scale airplane.
He mounted this aircraft on a catapult in order to provide an assisted tak
e off; this contraption was placed on top of a houseboat on the Potomac
River.</p><p>
On October of 1903, with his companion Charles Manley at the controls, he
made his first attempt at flying. The aircraft fell into the water soon
after launch. They tried again on December 8, 1903 but had the same
consequences.</p><p>
Langley abandoned his attempt at human flight after his failures and the
criticisms from the press.</p><p>
Critics of Langley classified him as a chauffeur because he had not paid
much attention to the aspect of flight control; he did, however, leave a
legacy by the contributions he made to aeronautics.</p>
<h4>D. The Wright Brothers</h4>
The Wright brothers drew on the rich heritage in aeronautical experiences
left them by their predecessors. They became interested in aviation after
the flight of Otto Lilienthal in 1896. They took up the study of birds as
a guide to mechanical flight; fro m their study they concluded that birds
regain their lateral balance when partly overturned by a gust of wind.
This emerged as the single most important development in aviation history,
the use of wings’ twist to control airplane in rolling motion. They c
oined the phase “wing warping.”<p>
They read all the available literature on the advancements in aeronautics,
then set out to experiment with wing warping. To test this concept they
built a biplane with a wing span of 5 ft. that was controlled from the
ground with strings. This concept worked.</p><p>
Encouraged, the Wright brothers decided to test this concept, but not
before gaining experience as “airmen.” They made their first 17 ft wing
span by September 1900 and flew it from Kitty Hawk on October of that
year.</p><p>
With this success they proceeded to build a second glider from their new
headquarters at Kill Devil Hills 4 miles to the south of Kitty Hawk; it
was tested in July and August of 1901. This new glider was larger than the
previous one. It had a wing span of 22 ft.</p><p>
The Wrights were very suspicious of the existing data from the literature,
especially those generated by Lilienthal and Langley. They built their own
wind tunnel and did their own investigations. From these researches they
built the number three glider. This was flown in December 1902 and
provided much information on the impact of wind tunnels.</p><p>
During 1902, they made more than 1000 perfect flights and set a distance
record of 26 seconds. The brothers had become experienced and skillful
pilots, and with all the theoretical and practical problems solved, they
felt that they could construct a machine whose stability and control in
the air depended on the pilot’s skill. The only diffficulty was to find an
existing engine capable of powering the aircraft. They could not find such
an engine; therefore they designed and built their own. It was 12 hp,
water cooled, and weighed only 200 lbs. They also built their own
propeller; thus they produced their first powered machine the “Flyer” in
the summer of 1903.</p><p>
They returned to their camp to find it in disarray. They repaired the
number 3 glider and practiced. Finally overcoming all setbacks (weather,
mechanical breakdowns), they were ready to test the Flyer. It was a
biplane of 40 ft with a wing area of 510 square feet and used a double
rudder behind the wings and a double elevator in front of the wings.</p><p>
With conditions favorable, they called five witnesses, and with a camera
set up for pictures the Flyer made its first historic flight. (Orville was
at the controls.)</p><p>
They did not stop with Flyer 1. In May 1904 they flew their second powered
machine, Flyer 2. They made improvements with a smaller wing camber. By
1905 Flyer 3 was ready. It was described as the world’s first practical
powered aeroplane, justified by the sturdiness of its structure. With
their combined contribution, research and inventions, the world was on the
threshold of a new form of vehicle for public transportation.</p>
<h4>E. The emergence of the aircraft as a valuable means of transportation</h4>
During 1909 the aeroplane had become accepted as the world’s new practical
vehicle. Louis Bleriot’s crossing of the Channel on July 25, and the first
air meeting at Rheims in August were significant signs. 
With the Wrights’ achievements and techniques to follow, European airmen
came into their own; so during the first half of the 1900s there was a
growing number of aviators, designers and amateurs, and the forms of their
aircraft began to multiply. The dominant types of aircraft became more
efficient and reliable. The message of powered flying began spreading over
the world and the beginnings of an aircraft industry, as well as
governments’ concerns with aviation, became evident.<p>
There were some diffficulties to be overcome to make the aeroplane more
efficient.</p><p>
l. The development of an engine with enough horse power to lift an aircraft off the ground. This was solved with the development of gasoline fueled internal combustion engines (the Wright brothers were pioneers in this area). The automobile industry then 
led the development of new engines.
<br/>
2. The development and the search for aeroplanes that could fly faster and higher. This problem was solved partly by the introduction of competitions; this prompted and advanced development of high speed aircraft. One notable competition was the Schneider
race.
</p><p>
Military aviation became a serious concern of leading European nations. As a result military and naval flying schools were established.</p><p>
When the First World War was declared, the aeroplane’s duties were as
aerial intelligence agents or scouts for visual and photographic
reconnaissance. During the war years the aircraft industry in Europe and
the United States expanded from a handful of machines in 1914 to 3300 in
use by 1918. It also provided many jobs, from a few hundred in 1914 to
nearly 350,000 workers in 1918.</p><p>
After the war there was more technical progress made and the acceptance of
the importance of flying was extended in the public’s mind, and air
transport became a means of public transportation. As Cayley predicted,
“We shall be able to transport ourselves and our families and their goods
and chattels, more securely by air than by water.”</p><p>
With the far reaching developments of combat aircraft, and the various
equipment for flying and communicating, comparable developments were
taking place in the aircraft for civil transport.</p><p>
After the war years, the non-military sphere of flying saw the most
dramatic developments. In 1919, the first air transport with scheduled
airlines started in Europe. The first civil airline for passengers began
in Germany February 8, 1919, with service between Berlin, Leipzig and
Vienna.</p><p>
The machines used in France, England and America as transport planes were
wartime bombers adapted to passenger planes.</p><p>
One important landmark in the air transport and private flying was the solo flight direct from New York to Paris on May 20-21, 1927. It helped to transform the entire travel industry and made the public more air-minded.</p><p>
It was in the United States that the first modern type airliner was the
Boeing 247, flown in February 1933. The second was Douglas DC-1 flown in
July 1933.</p><p>
These are a few of the airliners that emerged as a result of the
developments in aerodynamics and the demand for passenger planes.</p><p>
With the advent of the Second World War, there were enormous developments
in aviation and in aeroplane engines and all the types of equipment used
in flying. This period saw the jet propelled aeroplane and the production
of helicopters and long ranged rockets. After the war the industry turned
its attention to transport production.</p><p>
The leader in developing light and medium transports was the United
States. Aircraft were developed that set the style for modern heavy
transports with the Douglas Dakota (DC-3). This aircraft monopolized the
traffic on the world’s long haul airlines after the war.</p><p>
Following is a list of the aircraft that were developed and their
passenger capabilities.</p>
<dl><dt>1. Douglas Dakota (DC-3), USA
</dt><dt>2. Junkers Ja 52, Germany
</dt><dt>3. Douglas DC-4 Skymaster (Military C-54): February 1942. It had a crew of six and 42 passengers.
</dt><dt>4. Douglas DC-6: February 1946, into airline service 1947.
</dt><dt>5. Lockheed 049 (C-69): Jan 1943, carried 52 passengers.
</dt><dt>6. Stratocruiser: November 1944.
</dt></dl>
The preceding pages do not cover all the developments of the types of
aircraft that came into existence, but they do show that the stage was set
for the use of the aircraft as a public transport system. The need was met
as a result of the inventions that arose, so that the aircraft could be
viable in the war years. After that, technology was directed towards
passenger travel.<p>
The years after the wars also saw the research in aerodynamics directed to
rocketry and the aerospace industry.</p><p>
From the developments described in the previous pages, one can point to
many fruitful instances of applied mathematics. The following sections
will attempt to present some of the mathematical topics that can be
brought to bear on the history of flight.</p>

<h3>IV. The Mathematical Application</h3>
<h4>A. Geometry</h4>
1) <i>Introduction to Vectors to Represent a Journey</i> <p> If a
displacement has taken place, this movement can be written as a
displacement vector.</p><p>
The position of the plane in the picture relative to the airport can be
described as 5 miles, bearing 053 degrees.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
The position of the plane could be described as 4 miles east and 3 miles
north. Instead of saying 4 miles east and 3 miles north we could write
(4/3). This is a vector representation of the position of the plane. The
distance to the east is written first followed by the distance to the
north.</p><p>
If the plane moves from position S to position Q and the movement is 2
miles east and 6 miles north the total journey can be represented as a sum
(4/3) + (2/6) = (6/9). Vectors can be added by adding the top components 4
+ 2 and the bottom components 3 + 6.</p><p>
2) <i>Angles and Bearings</i>
</p><p>
Bearings are measured from the north line, the line or axis about which
the earth rotates. It cuts the surface of the earth at what are called the
north and south poles. The pole star is almost on this line and so appears
to be fixed in the heavens, while other stars seem to rotate about the
axis. The pole star gives a fixed direction from which navigators used to
set their course. Today the magnetic compass, which points in
approximately the same direction, is used to set a course.</p><p>
To set the bearing</p><p>
i) always start from the north line and
<br/>
ii) always measure the angle clockwise.
</p><p>
The following example will be used to demonstrate how to draw a model of a
journey.</p><p>
A pilot on an aircraft made a two stage journey.<br/>
Stage A: 500 miles, bearing 060 degrees<br/>
Stage B: 300 miles, bearing 150 degrees</p><p>
<i>1st step:</i> Draw the north line (NA), and measure the 060 degrees
angle clockwise from the north line. Draw a line to represent 500 miles
from the point A to B. This represents the first leg of the joumey.</p><p>
<i>2nd step:</i> At point B draw another north line, measure the angle of
150
degrees, and draw the length 300 miles.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
If the pilot had flown from A to C, we could measure the bearing of C from
A and measure the length of the line segment AC. The stages of this
journey can also be written as a displacement vector. (500, 060 degrees)
followed by (300, 150 degrees).</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
3) <i>Navigation and Spherical Geometry</i>
</p><p>
The following topic is being introduced with the intent of providing an
enrichment topic for students in the higher mathematics courses, since
some experience with trigonometry, logarithms and rotational symmetry
would be required.</p><p>
There are several methods of navigation: Pilotage is the method of flying
an aircraft from one point to another by the observation of landmarks
either already known or recognized from a map. This method has
limitations, because if the flight is over poorly mapped country, over
large bodies of water, or at night when visibility is poor, it is
difficult to use the landmarks. This method is most efficient when used
with other forms of navigation.</p><p>
The method Dead Reckoning is the basic method of navigation. It uses known
or established factors such as wind direction, wind velocity, and air
speed to compute a position from a known position. Lindbergh used Dead
Reckoning on his flight from New York to Paris.</p><p>
Radio Navigation is method of directing an aircraft from one point to
another by radio waves. Its major feature is that one does not wait to see
the ground to make approaches and landings.</p><p>
Celestial Navigation is the oldest method of navigation. This is the
determination of an aircraft by the observation of the celestial bodies to
determine position.</p><p>
Using a globe is the only accurate means of representing the spherical
surface of the earth.9 To make a mathematical model of the earth choose
the diameter NS passing through the north and south poles as axis of
rotation. If O is the midpoint of NS, and OQ is perpendicular to NS then
the locus of Q is the equator.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
To make a two-dimensional diagram of a sphere, the equator and the
parallels of latitude and the meridians are drawn.</p><p>
4) <i>Latitude and Longitude.</i> The coordinates used to describe points
on the Earth’s surface.
</p><p>
The position of a point A on the surface can be determined by stating:</p><p>
a) Which circular section perpendicular to NS contains A.
<br/>
b) Which position of the semi-circle rotating about NS contains A.
</p><p>
These pieces of information are given by specifying</p><p>
i) the latitude and
<br/>
ii) the longitude of A.
</p><p>
Figure III shows the equator and the circles, or parallels of latitude 60
degrees N and 50 degrees S. The range of latitude is from 0 degrees to 90
degrees north or south of the equator.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Figure IV shows the equator, the Greenwich meridian NGS and the
semicircles, or meridian of longitude 40 degrees W and 20 degrees E. The
range of longitude is from 0 degrees to 180 degrees East and West of
Greenwich.</p><p>
Figure V shows point A with latitude t degrees N, and longitude g degrees
W.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Figure VI shows the point P with latitude 60 degrees N and longitude 50
degrees W. Figure VII shows the point Q with latitude 30 degrees S and

<h4><i>The solution of right spherical triangles</i></h4>
A spherical angle is formed by intersecting arcs of two great circles. The
three important properties of spherical triangles are:
<dl><dt>
a) the sum of the lengths of any two sides exceeds the length of the third side;
</dt><dt>  b) the sum of the lengths of the three sides is less than 360 degrees;
</dt><dt>c) the sum of the angles is greater than 180 degrees but less than 540
degrees.
</dt></dl>
To find the great circle distance between two points A and B, the triangle
of reference is constructed as follows:<p>
i) The great circle joining A and B form one side of the triangle;
<br/>
ii) The meridians through both A and B form the other two sides.
</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
Two such triangles are formed and either can be used to obtain the great
circle distance from A to B. Example: Suppose A has latitude 60 degrees N,
longitude 55 degrees E, and B has latitude 60 degrees N, longitude 13
degrees W. The length of arc AB can be calculated as follows.</p><p>

</p><p>
* The radius of a circle of latitude t degrees = R cos t degrees where R
the radius of the earth is 6400 km.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
If a plane or ship follows a great circle path, its course is the angle
the path makes with the meridian of the ship and is measured from north
through east to the path of the ship. 
</p><h4>B. An Introduction to Graph Theory</h4>
The concept of drawing a graph to represent information has been used
extensively in mathematics. These ideas have been used to plot the routes
of the mailman, and of various delivery companies. These ideas are also
extended to the airline industry. They have been used in determining
routes between cities, and in providing a time line for doing various
activities that enable the efficient disembarkation and unloading of
baggage on an aircraft. 
<p>
Just as model aircraft are used to represent the real thing, models in
this section will be used as a representation of something else. The model
or graph will be used to give us an idea of what reality is.</p><p>
A graph is a finite set of points, called vertices, together with a finite
set of curved or straight connecting lines called edges, each of which
joins a pair of vertices. These vertices and edges satisfy the condition
that no edge begins or ends at the same vertex. Graphs without edges are
called null graphs.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
The figure in c) is not a graph because it violates the condition that no
end may join a vertex to itself. When a graph has two or more different
edges joining the same pair of vertices, these edges are called multiple
edges.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
The edge of a graph can be identified by using a letter to name it, and
the vertices (endpoints) can also be named. The edge E can be named (X1,
X2).</p><p>
Graphs are important tools in representing a vast number of real world
problems. Graphs that are used to represent the layout of streets are
called street networks. In this instance the edges of the graph can have a
direction indicated by arrow. These graphs are called digraphs. A digraph
is a finite, non-empty set of points called vertices, together with some
directed edges joining these points. These edges are subjected to one
restriction. The initial and terminal vertices of a directed edge may not
be the same.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
1) <i>Graphs and Matrices: Matrices from Drawings</i>
</p><p>
Matrices are presented as a means of storing information in which the
position of the information is very important. The direct route matrix is
used since it enables us to predict properties of more complicated
networks without reproducing them.</p><p>
The figure shows a network of roads:</p><p>
A direct route is the journey which does not pass through another
endpoint.</p><p>
One way of describing a direct route linking endpoints is to use an arrow diagram.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Another way of describing this is to use a table where zero means no
direct route, 1 means 1 direct route, 2 means two direct routes, etc.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
The rectangular array of numbers from the table can be represented in a
matrix:</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Instead of talking about endpoints or vertices and edges these ideas can
be applied to real life situations. The vertices or endpoints can be
referred to as towns or cities and the edges can be called routes or
roads.</p><p>
The diagram shows a network of roads between several towns with their
direct routes.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
One way of showing the direct routes linking the towns is to draw the
arrow diagram.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i></p><p>
<i>Directed Maps:</i> A map of a one-way system is called a directed map
because
arrows are placed on the roads to show in which directions to go.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i></p><p>
The matrix of a directed map is different from the matrix of an undirected
map since it is not symmetrical and it is also possible to have odd
elements on the leading diagonals.</p><p>
2) <i>Finding the Shortest Path</i>
</p><p>
A graph or network is defined by two sets of symbols, nodes and arcs.
Nodes are the set of points or vertices, arcs consists of an ordered pair
of vertices and represents a possible direction of motion that may occur
between vertices.</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i></p><p>
Arcs can be considered as one-way roads. For shortest path problems it
will be assumed that each arc in the network has a length associated with
it. The problem of finding the shortest path is the minimum length from
one node to any other node in the network.</p><p>
Dijkstra’s Algorithm:10 This algorithm for finding the shortest path
between a pair of nodes requires that all the arcs in the network have
non-negative arc length.</p><p>
The algorithm uses this method:</p><p>
1. Designate node one as the starting point.<br/>
2. Find the node closest to node one.<br/>
3. Find the second closest node to node one.<br/>
4. Find the third closest node to node one.<br/>
5. Continue until all the paths are used.
</p><p>
Let us use this method in the following example.<br/>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
The distances can be summarized in a table:</p><p>
<td. (2,5)="" +="" <td="" arc="">         	4 + 2 = 6
</td.><table>
<tbody><tr><td>
PATH  </td><td>             	LENGTH OF PATH

</td></tr><tr>
<td>	The arc (1,2)  </td><td>         	4
</td></tr><tr><td>  	The shortest path from node 1

</td></tr><tr><td>   	+ arc (5,6)           </td><td> 	6 + 2 = 8
</td></tr><tr><td>4. Determination of the fifth shortest path from node 1
</td></tr><tr><td>   	Shortest path from 1 to 4

</td></tr><tr><td>   	Shortest path from 1 to 5
</td></tr><tr><td>   	+ arc (5,6)          </td><td>  	6 + 2 = 8
</td></tr></tbody></table>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><i>Summary of shortest path</i>
</td></tr><tr><td>	Nodes	</td><td>Closest nodes to Node 1	</td><td>Path from Node
1 to the nth closest node
</td><td>Length of path
</td></tr><tr><td>	0	</td><td>1	</td><td>— 	 </td><td>—

</td></tr></tbody></table>
The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is either 1-2-5-6 or 1-3-5-6; both
have length 8. 
</p><p>
The digraph can also be used to solve complicated problems. Consider this
problem: We wish to minimize the time an aircraft spends at an airport.
The component activities can be placed in a table:</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>  A1   Disembark passengers</td><td>	1/2 hr.
</td></tr><tr>
<td>   A2   Unload baggage </td><td>	1 hr.
</td></tr><tr><td>   A3   Clean the plane</td><td>	1/2 hr.
</td></tr><tr><td>   A4   Take on new passengers</td><td>	1 hr.
</td></tr><tr><td>
A5   Load new baggage	</td><td>1 hr.
</td></tr></tbody></table>
We could simply sum all the numbers of hours but some of these tasks can
be done simultaneously and some operations are independent of others. A
good way to proceed is to draw a model called “The Activity Analysis
Digraph.”</p><p>
An Activity Analysis Digraph is constructed in the following way.</p>
<dl><dt>   1. Represent each activity by a node A1, A2,  . . .  An with
the
time required for the activity.
</dt><dt>   2. Create two additional nodes each labeled with the number zero, one representing the job’s beginning and the other the job’s end.
</dt><dt>   3. Draw a directed edge from one activity to the next only if the
first activity precedes the second.
</dt></dl>
Now that we have drawn a model, the problem is to determine the shortest
time for the completion of the whole job. We can proceed as follows:
<dl><dt>
1. Denote time t measured from starting point B; t = 0
</dt><dt>   2. Rephrase the problem; given an Activity Analysis Digraph for a project. What will be the shortest time at which E, the end, can be completed?
</dt><dt>3. Add the times for all activities on the path up to but not
including E (There may be more than one path from B to E).
</dt></dl>
The critical path is the path of longest time from B to E. To determine
the most efficient schedule in the problem is the critical path B, A2, A4,
which has length of two hours and this gives the minimum time for the
whole job to be completed.<p>
To explain, the activities A1 and A2 can both be started at time zero
(passengers can disembark and luggage be taken off at the same time).</p><p>
The activity A3 cannot be started until all the passengers are taken off;
the activity A4 cannot be started until A3 is completed but can be made to
overlap with A5; we cannot arrive at E until both A4 and A5 are
completed.</p>
