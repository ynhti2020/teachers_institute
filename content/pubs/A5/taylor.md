<h3>Introduction</h3>
Today we’re going to begin a new exploration, a voyage. We’re going to
learn about water, boats, marine life, and men of the sea—watermen. While
we’re studying the seascapes and the lives of others, we will also start
to explore the patterns and seascapes
of our lives. Why is mankind fascinated by the sea? What elemental drives
have urged man to explore the unknown? Why by sea? What urge compelled you
to want to explore the oceans? <p> “Man hoisted sail before he saddled a
horse . . . Watercraft were man’s first tool for his conquest of the
world,” says Thor Heyerdahl in the <i>Early Man and the Ocean.</i></p><p>
In his book Heyerdahl demonstrates that it was much faster and easier to
carry goods by water than overland. Tons of goods could be transported
hundreds of miles by water.</p><p>
Is it just practicality then that causes man to venture on the
waterways—the easiest way of getting from one place to another? What about
the present day? Why do men still explore the sea when faster and safer
methods of travel are now available? In this unit we will explore some
possibilities.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
The life of our seas is important to every person on earth. Even if a man
or woman has never seen the major oceans and lives in the middle of a vast
desert, the quality of his or her life is dependent upon the conditions of
the seas. <p> Throughout centuries, mankind has used the seas for water,
commerce, conquest, food, power, recreation, transportation, and waste
disposal. The development of sea craft and mankind’s increasing
explorations have determined in large measure the place in wh ich we live,
the languages we speak, and the way we think of our world. Today, with an
ever-growing world population, and geometrically increasing dependency
upon the world’s water, we are in danger of poisoning our children and
ourselves and consequently, our entire world. By educating our children
and ourselves about the sea and its importance to mankind’s survival, we
may foster prudent use of our waterways and prevent worldwide destruction
of our most important resource, water.</p><p>
This is an English unit which uses the theme of ocean exploration as a
basis for teaching reading, thinking, writing, and speaking. This unit is
intended as an introduction to the language and lore of the sea and is
meant to be used with high school fresh men, although it may be adapted to
other grade levels. In addition to the development of basic English
skills, this unit has as a goal the extension of students’ knowledge and
awareness of the sea. As a central part of this unit, students will
develop a l og wherein they will explore not only the physical aspects of
this world, but also their own mental and, to some degree, emotional
selves. I hope that one outcome of this unit will be that the students
will understand our symbiotic relationship with the s ea and the need to
respect the oceans. It is also hoped that in the future they will desire
to work actively to save our coastal environments.</p><p>
General objectives for this unit are:</p>
<dl><dt>1. To improve skills in reading, understanding, and analyzing
specific works of poetry, fiction, and non-fiction.
</dt><dt>2. To learn vocabulary of the sea, and to increase working vocabulary generally.
</dt><dt>3. To become familiar with selected literature of the sea.
</dt><dt>4. To practice and to improve skills in writing by answering questions, writing observations, narratives, summaries, log entries, and other writing activities.
</dt><dt>5. To gain skill in critical thinking and speaking by participating in group discussions, presentation, and problem solving activities.
</dt><dt>6. To understand mankind and his relationship to the sea by observing
how other men have worked with the sea and analyzing one’s own experiences on the ocean.
</dt></dl>
The presentations in this unit are not intended to be followed recipe
style. They are presented merely as suggestions that the teacher may
choose to select or to adapt to his or her own way of working. Before
beginning with a unit of this kind it is important to understand a little
about the water which surrounds us.

<h3>The Seas</h3>
To understand the importance of the oceans in our lives, we must go back,
briefly, to the beginnings of the earth. Current theory maintains that as
the earth cooled, hydrogen and oxygen—water’s components—formed water
vapor. As the earth’s crust continued
to cool this vapor began to rain—for centuries, creating the lakes,
rivers, and oceans of the earth. 
<p>
Today, every drop of this original water is still in use. The cycle begins
as water vapor which, moved by air currents and changing temperatures,
becomes liquid or solid and falls upon our world.</p><p>
This water flows into the waterways and splatters onto the ground. Water
then seeps below ground and sinks through our rivers, lake and stream beds
picking up salts, minerals, and earth as it travels. Eventually, this
mineral-rich water travels to the oceans where wind and temperature
evaporate large amounts of the water and the process begins again.</p><p>
Over ninety-seven percent of all the water on earth, according to the U.S.
Dept. of the Interior, is held in the oceans. 2.15 percent is frozen in
glaciers and polar caps, and the rest, less than one percent, make up the
lakes, rivers, streams, and underg round water deposits. Only six-tenths
of one percent of all the water in the world is available for use by
mankind and nature as surface ground water.1</p><p>
Seventy-one percent of the earth’s surface is covered by our seas and
oceans. Within the oceans lie whole mountain ranges, large valleys up to
six and one-half miles deep, entire rivers of current, and seemingly
infinite forms of sea life including today’s largest animal, the whale.
The ocean offers vast resources in the form of food, and has been
traditionally a source of good, cheap protein, making fishing a thriving
industry in any coastal community.</p><p>
Additionally, the ocean contains every element found on dry land
including, according to James Dugan in <i>World Beneath the Sea,</i> “... an
estimated ten million tons of gold, 500 million tons of silver, and twenty
billion tons of uranium.”</p><p>
From the same text Dr. John Mero, president of Ocean Resources Inc., one
of the companies pioneering in ocean mining, states: “The dangers and the
lack of technology have slowed the development of ocean mining. But I
think that within the next 30 years offshore mining will be a five-to-ten
million dollar industry . . . By the year 2000, offshore wells will supply
fifty percent of the world’s oil.”</p><p>
The potential of the sea also includes its power. Today, around the world,
several countries use the ebb and flow of the tides to generate
electricity.</p><p>
Furthermore, the value of the seas for recreation must not be
underestimated. In 1968, Dr. Edwin Winslow and Alexander Bigler, planners,
found that 112 million people spent approximately fourteen billion dollars
on ocean-oriented recreation in the United States. This figure surpassed
the money spent to buy fish caught by our fishing industry and petroleum
products resulting from our offshore oil wells. Recreation is the largest
of all the industries derived from the seas.2</p><p>
If we think in terms of human lives rather than millions of dollars then
the most important of all the sea’s resources is fresh water. James Dugan
states that over 100 million gallons of water flow every day from the
world’s desalination plants. Key West Florida with a population of over
34,000 depends upon such a plant to fulfill all of its water
requirements.</p><p>
Despite the assets gained from the sea, mankind is the cause of a major
liability—pollution.</p><p>
In another quotation from <i>World Beneath the Sea</i> James Dugan
asserts: “In
the United States some fifty-two million people, one-fourth of the
population, live within 50 miles of the sea coasts. From these congested
areas, a torrent of domestic and industrial effluents spill directly into
bays, estuaries, and coastal waters.”</p><p>
Add to these effects the poisoning of the sea from the world over and it
is easy to sea the unhappy consequences on us all. Because the oceans are
in many ways a dominant factor in the total environment, mankind’s
interference in any one element may affect the entire world in ways that
we don’t yet understand.</p><p>
The U.S. Commission of Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources in its
publication, <i>Our Nation and the Sea,</i> states: “Mankind is fast
approaching
a stage when the total planetary environment can be influenced, modified
and perhaps controlled by human activities.”</p><p>
This means that the imaginary person at the beginning of this writing who
lives in the midst of a vast desert may be unable to obtain edible fish or
to vacation near the ocean. He may find his skies raining poison rather
than clean water, or that man’s interference may have rerouted the air
currents preventing any water at all from reaching his isolated home. 
Because of usurpation of our underground water reserves, our hypothetical
man may even discover that the water table has dropped so low that he
cannot obtain enough clean water to sustain himself. The need for everyone
to know something about our waterways is paramount to our future
survival.</p>

<a name="d">
<h3>Seacraft</h3>
Boats have been part of man’s culture since earliest times. Proof of this
is that the earliest records of boats, Egyptian and Mesopotamian pictures,
show an already well-developed seacraft. Common sense dictates that people
who live near large bodies of water, be they lakes, rivers, or oceans,
must of necessity learn to cope with them. Failure to understand the seas
leads to tragedy. Mastery of the seas, on the other hand, brings many
rewards: food, drink, transportation, recreation, wealth, and power. 
The first requirement of any sea-going craft, as Thor Heyerdahl points
out, must be that it float. Suppose, therefore, that the first boat was a
log. Lash a few logs together and you have created a raft capable of
supporting tons of weight. In <i>Kon Tiki,</i> Dr. Heyerdahl proved that a
simple
raft could not only sail rivers and inland waterways, but be a seaworthy
craft as well.<p>
Peter Freuchen in his <i>Book of the Seven Seas </i>shows that primitive
peoples
all over the world had seaworthy craft. Inhabitants of the South Pacific
constructed easily maneuverable balsa wood rafts and outrigger canoes;
Eskimos made kayaks and larger canoe- like boats, called oomiaks, from
animal skins; the Egyptians fashioned sea-worthy boats of reeds; and the
Russians made large, clumsy rafts of spruce. Peoples all over the world
have found ways of making sea-going craft from the materials available to
them.</p><p>
Although most of these craft used manpower, some of these early peoples
had discovered the principles of sail and the wind-driven craft. The
Egyptians, Vikings, Greeks, Phoenicians, and South Americans all used the
wind to power their boats or rafts long before the time we ascribe to the
large sailing ship.</p><p>
Most of these craft could only sail before the wind. For that reason men
also were used to power the craft. Often the men who rowed these ships
were slaves or prisoners who would spend their entire lives chained to the
oars they pulled.</p><p>
Because human nature is not all goodness and light, it was soon discovered
that the people who obtained the seas gained wealth and power of which,
otherwise, they could only dream. Thus, the Egyptians, rulers of the Nile,
used the labor of conquered nations to man the galleys of their warships
and pleasure craft. The Greeks, who under Alexander the Great ruled the
world as they conceived it, controlled the entire Mediterranean with their
large navy. And to the North, Vikings with their soldier-rowed ships
containing one large sail, controlled the northern seas as far west as
Canada.</p><p>
The era of the modern sailing ship really began in the fifteenth century
with Prince Henry of Portugal. He became fascinated by the sea and in 1416
founded a school for seamen. He invited the most knowledgeable scholars
from all over the world to the school. The personnel included
mathematicians, map makers, astronomers, and sailors. His goal was to
develop a craft hardy enough to explore the oceans without hugging the
land. The result was the caravel which was, according to Peter Freuchen in
the <i>Book of the Seven Seas,</i> “larger and slimmer than anything yet
made,
carried more sail and was tough enough to withstand gales and waves at
sea.”</p><p>
This technological achievement gave the Portuguese and the Spanish control
of the seas for many years. During the course of that time Spain and
Portugal divided the Americas between them and became wealthy from their
trade in the East. Their first, serious challenge came from the Turks whom
they demolished, and later from the British. Most students have heard of
the Spanish Armada and the battle in which the little English navy
destroyed the big Spanish fleet.</p><p>
According to Peter Freuchen, the two navies were evenly matched in number
and size of ships and in number of men. The English, however, had better
trained leadership who possessed a new battle strategy and technologically
improved ships, which were able to encircle parts of the Spanish fleet and
pound the hulls with cannon shot.</p><p>
After ten days of bitter fighting, the Spanish fleet began a retreat—north
around Scotland. More Spaniards died on the flight home than in the
battle, and the British had established themselves as the new rulers of
the sea.</p><p>
While the English battled Spain for possession of the sea, the Dutch had
improved the carrying ability of their ships and had simplified the
rigging, so that even Sir Walter Raleigh reported that a Dutch ship of 200
tons was able to carry goods cheaper than a British ship “. . . by reason
he hath but nine or ten mariners and we nearly thirty.” Also they “build
every year near one thousand ships and not a timber tree growing in their
own country.” 3</p><p>
Wealthy Dutch merchants formed the monopolistic Dutch East India Company
and infiltrated the Spanish and Portuguese trade in the East. Their Dutch
cogs rounded the Cape of Good Hope in Africa and headed for Java, where
they loaded spices, fabric, and metals from the Orient. To the North the
Dutch searched for the northeast route across the top of the world,
founded Spitzbergen, and returned not only with furs but also with oil,
bone, and ambergris from a lucrative whaling industry. These ships made
Holland one of the richest nations of the seventeenth century.</p><p>
The English East India Company competed with the Dutch both in the East
and in the North. Eventually, the British brought India under its
influence and practiced whaling in the open seas after the whales had
learned to avoid the land. In time the British
also dominated China’s tea and opium trade and outlived its Dutch rival.</p><p>
In addition to the Dutch, the Scandinavians to the north also enjoyed the
prosperity of a booming fur trade and whaling industry. The Americans, not
to be outdone, perfected the art of whaling and developed a shipbuilding
industry along the Eastern shore. 
</p><p>
America entered sailing in the eighteenth century and remained competitive
for many decades. Americans designed the fastest sailing ships abroad for
the purpose of sailing opium, slaves, or anything else that could be
traded for huge sums of money. In addition to these fast-running clippers
there were fishing boats, whalers, and many other boats built for special
purposes. The American coast from New York to Boston contained some of the
finest shipbuilders in the world.</p><p>
New Haven, then as now, was a town with a strong sea-going tradition. The
sharpie, a boat peculiar to the area, was an early oyster boat. In
addition, schooners and ketches made their way into New Haven harbor. Some
of New Haven’s first families, the Townsends for example, made their money running produce to the Caribbean to
feed the slaves and returning with rum and a little slave-running on the
side. Most New Haven watermen, however, were fishermen working Long Island
Sound much as they do today.</p><p>
In the early nineteenth century, Robert Fulton’s steam engine began the
end of the era of sail and made the African and Asian continents
accessible. The Europeans were able to carve up the African continent and
gain entry to China and India. Steam was quickly followed by the highly
efficient diesel motor which most commercial craft still use today.</p><p>
One other point that needs to be mentioned is the condition of the crew on
sea-going vessels. Many of our students watch “Love Boat” on television or
read romanticized accounts of trips to foreign lands. Recruiting officers
even today are not very honest in depicting life as it really is aboard
ship: “Join the Navy and see the world.” But life aboard sailing vessels
was extremely hard. It was even more difficult if the captain was hard or
incompetent. Sailors had the poorest quarters, little and often rotten or
moldy food, and brackish, sometimes contaminated water. More men died from
illness than from the everyday hazards of the sea.</p><p>
To make matters worse, when at sea, crewmen were at the complete mercy of
the captain who had the power of life or death over his men. And if a man
survived years at sea and managed to get home, he was often cheated of his
wages. Conditions were often so bad aboard ship that captains would not
put into port in order to keep their crews. Sailors were often shanghaied
by men called crimps and sometimes the seamen were slaughtered or left in
a foreign port near the end of a voyage for their wages or their share of
the profits. In the United States, it was not until the nineteenth
century, after the publication of <i>Dana’s Two Years Before the Mast,</i>
that
the first laws protecting the ordinary seaman were passed.</p><p>
The change to steam engines produced little change of conditions for the
seamen. Stoking the massive boilers and cleaning out the ashes and soot
were hot, dirty, and dangerous jobs. Further, the space occupied by the
boilers and the fuel precluded better accommodations for the crew. The
diesel engine and changing social mores allowed for improvement in living
conditions for the sailors. Even today, however, stories abound of crews
which have been mistreated aboard ship, and it is well for anyone thinking
of signing upon the nearest tramp steamer to be wary.</p>

<h3>The Log</h3>
As part of the unit’s experience students will be asked to keep a log. A
log is a journal or diary where a person writes his or her impressions,
thoughts, feelings, and dreams. A sailor’s log begins with observations
about the weather, time of day, location, and surroundings. These writings
were not just a whim on the part of early seamen. These observations were
often central to a ship’s survival. Before discovery of accurate ways to
determine longitude, many captains’ logs were kept secret because of the
information they contained about tides, winds, currents, hidden reefs, and
other dangers. 
<p>
A log forces the writer to be more careful observer of things around him
as well as his inner life. In order to derive the benefits of a log, it is
best to establish a routine, daily, if possible.</p><p>
Because a log is handled every day, it must be quite sturdy. It is best if
the pages are sewn rather than glued or threaded with spiral wire or rings
because the pages are less likely to come apart. Thicker covers tend to
last longer than thin, paper covers. Notebooks fitting this description
can be found inexpensively or if you choose, fancier bound books are
available. Students in my classes have found logs for as little as one
dollar, although several have decided to buy more fancy books.</p><p>
Students will be given assignments to complete in the log, but more often students may write in the log whatever pleases them. There are many things students can put in their logs:</p>
<dl><dt>1. Students can use the log to picture their lives, not only with
words,
but with pictures or colors or things students feel give an honest presentation of their lives.
</dt><dt>2. Students can use the log to write what they think and feel are
important to them. For example: What would you like to do with your
future? Are people pushing you in directions you don’t want to go? How?
Why? Can you change this situation? How do you feel about selected people
in your life? Would you like to change them? Yourself? In what way? 
</dt><dt>3. Students can use the log to write new ideas, those that just pop
into the head or those which require careful development. Students may
also write new ideas that they’ve read or heard about. The student may
wish to expand these ideas or perhaps create a fantasy. 
</dt><dt>4. The student may write snatches of conversations he or she thinks
clever, funny, or dramatic. Many writers use this technique to preserve
ideas, and a student may find something he or she wishes to use in a
future story. Students can jot down jokes, family stories. the latest
rhyme or poem. 
</dt><dt>5. Vocabulary is a very important tool for a writer. Write down new
words and their meanings, make puzzles of the words, or put down the new
words in sentences. 
</dt><dt>6. Describe people, things, a favorite room, the cafeteria at lunch
time, a best friend, a favorite grandparent, the lake on a rainy morning. 
</dt><dt>7. Put real items in the log: photographs of good friends or of a
happy trip, past theater ticket stubs for a terrific time, a postcard from
a foreign land or a cartoon the student enjoyed. Use rubber cement as the
glue so it is possible to remove or rearrange items.
</dt><dt>8. Experiment! Try a new kind of writing, a secret code, or some
unusual poetry. Bend the conventions, break the rules, and see if you like it.
</dt></dl>
In addition to giving students ideas about how to use the log, show
students examples from logs or diaries. Following are some brief examples
from previously printed writings.<p>
Below is a sample from Dove by Robin Graham, just a few days after the
start of his trip:</p>
<blockquote>“Just took down the mainsail . . . because of a squall. 
Enjoyed seawater bath—poured buckets of brine over my head. Gosh it’s good
to feel clean. The smell in the cabin had disappeared, so it must have
been me that caused it and not the cats.”
</blockquote>
Later, when he is almost home, Robin writes:
<blockquote>“I can’t believe it . . . I don’t know what I really feel
except that my
stomach is all knotted up . . .”</blockquote>
In Joan Baez’s book, Daybreak, she writes about her mother:
<blockquote>“My mother—she can’t understand anything phony. She refuses to
go to teas, prefers young people to older . . . When she runs on the
beach, dressed in blue jeans and a T-shirt with her hair all down, she
looks nineteen. She is fifty-four . . .”
</blockquote>
Thor Heyerdahl writes in Kon Tiki:
<blockquote>“May 17. Norwegian Independence Day. Heavy sea and fair wind.
I
am cook today and found seven flying fish on deck, one squid on the cabin
roof, and one unknown fish in Torstein’s sleeping bag . . .”
</blockquote>
It is important to fix a specific amount of time each day to write in the
log. The time can vary from ten minutes to one hour or more.  Students
should write even if they feel they’ve nothing to say. It’s important to
establish the habit. The good writing will come. On the other hand,
students should not be slaves to their logs either. If one misses a day
here and there or if some days produce just a few ragged lines, no great
harm has been done. Students should keep logbooks neat and write and draw
in ink or magic marker only to prevent smudging.<p>
I normally begin each year with regular log checks, collecting them for
assignments or just reading through them, beginning at eight-to-ten day
intervals and gradually expanding to once every six or eight weeks. In
this way I hope to establish writing as a habit and also encourage
students to continue their logs long after they’ve left the classroom.</p>

<h3>Presentation</h3>
There is no best way to present the elements of this unit. This unit
begins with short fiction because most students are already familiar with
the short story and because a suspenseful story can draw students into
reading information about the sea. 
<p>
Additionally it is important that an English unit be flexible enough to
blend with other units in a marine studies environment. If, for example,
students are going on an orientation trip aboard a boat, that may be the
ideal time to study vocabulary identifying parts of a ship.</p><p>
After students’ first trip, the teacher may wish to capture students’
observations in their logs. While students are learning to use some
navigational aids, the instructor may have students write instruction
booklets or produce instructional films or demonstrations about the use of
various navigational tools. In this unit Gallico’s “The Snow Goose” is the
second story presented. If, however, students don’t study the tidal
marshes until spring, the teacher may wish to postpone reading “The Snow
Goose” until then.</p><p>
The next section of this paper begins with samples of introductory lesson
plans followed by study guides for several writings. Texts or anthologies
in which these writings can be located are listed in the bibliography at
the end of this paper. Wherever possible, suggestions for other readings
in the same genre are listed at the end of each guide.</p>

<h3>Lesson Plans</h3>
<h4>Day 1</h4>
<b><i>Objectives</i></b><br/>
To introduce students to writing in logbooks.<br/>
To encourage students to think constructively about life goals.<p>
<b><i>Materials</i></b><br/>
Logbooks, pens.</p><p>
<b><i>Procedure</i></b><br/>
Explain that the students are to write their first entry.<br/>
Students should begin by placing the date, time, temperature, weather, and
surroundings at the top of their entry. The book <i>The Boy Who Sailed
Around
the World Alone</i> contains pictures of his log that students can
examine.
The teacher may wish to display this and other samples of logs.</p>
<h4>Day 2</h4>
<b><i>Objectives</i></b>
<br/>
To share student writings and ideas.<br/>
To explore a question and express your own ideas—an introduction to
exposition.<p>
<b><i>Materials</i></b>
Logbooks, pens, transparencies containing presentations.</p><p>
<b><i>Procedure</i></b>
Encourage students to share voluntarily their imaginary trips.</p><p>
Discuss stories: Why did you choose to travel there? Why do you want to
go? Do we sometimes want to do things without knowing why?</p><p>
On a transparency, present the following:</p>
<blockquote>
a. Kenichi Horie sailed alone from Osaka, Japan to San Francisco in 1962. 
He was 23 years old at the time. When asked, “Why did you do it?” he
responded in his book, <i>Kodoku:</i> “Well, I crossed it just because I
wanted
to. Honestly, I didn’t have any purpose or motive other than that when I
decided to sail across the Pacific. But none of these people were able to
understand this.”
<p>
b. In <i>Moby Dick,</i> Ishmael says: “Whenever I find myself going grim
about
the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul . . .
whenever . . . it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from
deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people’s
hats off—then, I account it high time to get to the sea as soon as I can.”
</p></blockquote>
Ask students their thoughts on each quotation. Allow a few minutes
discussion.<p>
Assignment: Why is it hard for a person to explain why they want to go to
the sea? Are they hiding something from others? From themselves? Why would
going to sea help Ishmael? Did you ever want to change the routine of your
life? If so, what were your reasons for desiring a change? Did you get a
chance to get away? Where did you go? Did the experience change you? How? 
Ask students to express their feelings about these questions, then to
write about a time they wanted to go away. Students may choose an
alternate experience of explaining why Ishmael yearns for the sea. Length:
150-200 words.</p><p>
Students will be reading several stories in which an individual decides to
go to sea. Students should always look for the reasons a person begins an
adventure.</p>

<h4>Fiction</h4>
Short story: “Sea Devil,” by Arthur Gordon<br/>
“Sea Devil” tells of a man whose name we never know, but of whom we learn
that he likes to fish at night, because “he found in it a reality that
seemed to be missing from his twentieth century job and from his daily
life.” He fishes by using a cast net. On one particular velvety Florida
night, he casts his net only to have the sea “explode in his face.” He has
ensnared a “Sea Devil”—a large manta ray—in his net and because the net is
attached to his wrist, the man finds himself suddenly dragged into the
ocean, and struggling for his life. How he survives, and he does survive,
is told in stirring descriptions which lend themselves to being read
aloud. As a result of his experience, the man learns something about his
relationship with nature which changes his life.<p>
<b><i>Questions:</i></b>

Poem: “Carmel Point,” by Margaret Phyllis MacSweeney</p><p>
In this poem the speaker witnesses a “daring” young crab eaten alive by a
beautiful, soft flower-like sea anemone. The speaker runs to his or her
father and tells him that he or she is “sorry to be born” because he or
she is frightened by so many things. The imagery in the poem is quite
beautiful and at the same time menacing. The poem uses personification
portraying the anemone as a woman.</p><p>
<i>Questions:</i></p>
<dl><dt>1. Why is the speaker horrified to see the anemone eat the crab?
</dt><dt>2. What aspect of this occurrence makes the speaker afraid?
</dt></dl>
<i>Log Assignment:</i> Have you ever seen anything that frightened you? 
Describe what you saw. Describe the colors, sizes, shapes, smells, and
feelings of the time. How did you feel as you watched? What did you do
afterward? When did you first realize you were afraid? Did this experience
change you in any way?<p>
<i>Project:</i> There are many kinds of sea anemones. Design a story board
or a
series of slides with pictures of various anemones. Write a dialogue in
which you describe the plants, their habitat, and their life cycles.</p><p>
Poem: “First Lesson,” by Philip Booth<br/>
In this poem a father comforts his daughter during her first swimming
lesson. The poem flows rhythmically and visually like the waves in the
ocean. The speaker encourages his daughter not to float “face down” but
when afraid to “lie back” and let the waves “hold you.”</p><p>
This poem, like “Carmel Point,” uses the sea to express a viewpoint about
living. It is an optimistic poem with a lesson about riding with life.
Have students reread the last five lines of the poem and talk about what
they mean.</p><p>
<i>Log Entry:</i> How can the last five lines of the poem be applied to
life
generally. Give an example from your life to show how this advice could be
used.</p><p>
<i>Project:</i> Write and illustrate a poem of your own about a “First
lesson”
you had. It does not have to be about swimming, but could be about a first
day at school or a first party or the first boy or girl you dated. Think
about the first time you did someth
ing or realized something, and fashion your own poem.</p><p>
Novelette: <i>The Snow Goose,</i> by Paul Gallico<br/>
The Snow Goose is a short novel which takes place in England from 1930 to
1960. Rhayader, hunchbacked and with a misshapen arm, resides alone in an
old lighthouse amidst estuaries which he has shaped into a wildlife
preserve. One afternoon, a young girl,Fritha, comes to his home carrying a
wounded large white bird. Rhayader helps the bird, a Canadian snow goose,
and the bird and the girl become regular visitors to the lighthouse. Years
pass and the girl and the bird grow to adulthood.</p><p>
During this time Rhayader and Fritha have grown to care for one another
and share a mutual regard for the wildlife which surrounds them.</p><p>
World War II erupts and Rhayader attempts to enlist but is rejected due to
his deformity. Then in 1940 British men are stranded along the shore in
the Battle of Dunkirk. A general call is issued for anyone possessed of a
boat to go in under fire and rescue the stranded soldiers. Rhayader goes,
despite Fritha’s protestations, valiantly rescues many men, and is killed. 
The snow goose returns to Canada, and Fritha continues to care for
Rhayader’s birds until the lighthouse is bombed by the Germans. The sea
regains the land and the estuary becomes barren and desolate.</p><p>
Although sentimental, the story is simply and beautifully told. It’s easy
to see the similarities between Fritha, Rhayader, and the snow goose, and
students will respond to Rhayader’s courage. Students will also learn
something about the relationship of man to nature and about the

Play: <i>The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,</i> by Herman Wouk</p><p>
Lieutenant Stephen Maryk is being court-martialed for relieving his
superior officer, Commander Philip Francis Queeg, of his duty during the
course of a storm. Because this breech of the law occurs during World War
II, Maryk’s life is at stake. He is being defended by Lieutenant Barney
Greenwald at the request of the prosecuting attorney, Lieutenant Commander
John Challee. Challee has requested Greenwald to take the case because he
recognized his friend as a fighter for lost causes.</p><p>
At first Maryk has little faith in Greenwald. Greenwald has expressed his
view that he’d rather prosecute Maryk than defend him. Greenwald refuses
to tell Maryk the plan for Maryk’s defense. When Maryk asks him why he
took the case, Greenwald explains that he is the only person who can free
Maryk.</p><p>
Maryk decides to gamble and the trial begins. Various witnesses tell of
the conditions aboard ship, the storm, and the ship’s takeover. The trial
is masterfully presented as Maryk’s witnesses are shown to be scheming,
idiotic, or unknowledgeable. Greenwald realizes that the only way to save
his client is to prove Queeg incompetent. This he does by skillfully
manipulating Queeg and bending the legal system. Maryk is acquitted but at
the expense of Queeg’s career.</p><p>
At a victory celebration Greenwald surprises everyone by demonstrating
that Lieutenant Thomas Keefer, a novelist and supposed friend of Maryk,
engineered the takeover and that Queeg, for all of his unpleasant
eccentricities, had a noble side. He was there when the war began, or, as
Greenwald puts it, he kept “Mama out of the soap dish.”</p><p>
Students must understand a little about World War II and the navy
regulations in order to understand the play. Once that is accomplished,
they should find the play easy going. Because this play is simply staged,
have the students act it out. Because each character is so distinct,
students will gain much from watching the actions. Have the student take
turns directing various scenes.</p><p>
In this play is a variety of conflict. It exists between persons, between
the individual and the institution, and between the reality of life versus
the ideal. The question, “Is there a time to go to war?” is again raised.
There is enough conflict to encourage excellent discussions.</p><p>
<i>Questions: Act I</i></p>

<h4>Non-Fiction</h4>
Narrative: <i>Dove,</i> by Robin Lee Graham<br/>
At sixteen years of age and already an experienced seaman, Robin Lee
Graham yearns to see the world. He wants to run away from school,
regimented civilization, and the crowded, polluted cities in which he has
lived. He wants to do something different, special, and totally his
own.<p>
Robin’s father, fearing dread consequences of his son’s restlessness, buys
and outfits Dove, a 24 foot fiberglass sloop. And on July 27, 1965, Robin
begins his trip, alone, around the world.</p><p>
In his book, also called <i>Dove,</i> Robin recounts his adventures. As he
sails
from island to island, Robin tells of the wonderful people he meets and
their customs. He describes his battles against stormy seas and his
struggles with loneliness during calms. During this five year voyage,
Robin also meets his future bride, but most importantly he tells how he
grows as a person.</p><p>
This book is more modern than some of the around-the-world-alone
adventures and should be easy to read because it is told in a
straightforward manner. It is a book with which most teens can identify
because Robin is a very ordinary boy who has the same feelings about
school, adults, love, and the world that most students have.</p><p>

</dt><dt>6. On the way to Durban, Dove almost foundered in a storm. How did Robin react? What was he thinking? What did he do?

</dt><dt>5. What is his response to the attention he received from the media?
</dt><dt>6. How have the Grahams decided to live now that the trip is over and the baby born? What are their reasons?
</dt></dl>
<i>The Book as a Whole</i>
<dl><dt>1. Why did Robin make the voyage?
</dt><dt>2. How did the loneliness affect him?
</dt><dt>3. What were the most difficult parts of the journey? How did he react to these challenges. What kept him going? Why did he survive?
