<h3><center>Guidelines for Writing a Curriculum Unit, 1991</center></h3>
<p>
The Institute attaches great importance to the process for writing
curriculum units, which includes a prospectus and two drafts before
submission of a completed unit. These steps for writing a unit provide you
the opportunity to develop your ideas with regard to the comments of your
seminar leader and other school teachers, who are the main audience for
whom you are writing. Because of the importance of the writing process
and the care with which the Institute schedule has been designed, it is
essential that Fellows meet all deadlines. Units which have not been
prepared in accordance with this process cannot be accepted.</p><p>
The prospectus, each draft and the completed unit should be submitted to
your seminar leader by the following dates. Individual assistance with
technical questions about the preparation of curriculum units consistent
with these Guidelines is available by advance appointment with an
Institute Coordinator in the seminar.</p>
<h4>Unit Topic and Reading List: due April 9</h4>
Each Fellow, in consultation with the seminar leader and other seminar
members, refines his or her topic and chooses basic readings for
research.
<h4>Prospectus: due April 23</h4>
<br/>
A prospectus of two-to-four pages describes what you intend the final
unit to contain. This provides your colleagues an overview of your
project.
<h4>First Draft: due May 28</h4>
This is your first draft of the prose statement of the unit's objectives
and
strategies. The seminar leader provides written comments on this draft.
<h4>Second Draft: due July 2</h4>
This draft includes a rewriting of the objectives and strategies of your
unit, based upon comments of your seminar leader and other teachers, and
a first writing of the unit's other elements. The draft is returned with
the
seminar leader's comments.
<h4>Completed Unit: due July 31</h4>
This is the third rewriting and refinement of the prose section of the
unit
and the final version of the entire unit. Fellows should consult Institute
instructions for typing, illustration, and use of any copyrighted
material.
<h4>The Elements of a Curriculum Unit</h4>
After reading widely about your chosen topic and participating regularly
in your seminar, you should complete a curriculum unit consisting of:<p>
1. <i>objectives</i>-a clear statement of what the unit seeks to
achieve;<br/>
2. <i>strategies</i>-a unified, coherent teaching plan for those
objectives;<br/>
3. <i>classroom activities</i>-three or more detailed examples of
actual
teaching methods or lesson plans;<br/>
4. <i>resources</i>-three annotated lists of materials you have
reviewed:
a bibliography for teachers, a reading list for students, and a list of
materials for classroom use. You should explain in the prose section of
the
unit how these resources relate to your objectives, particularly if a main
purpose of your unit is to develop new classroom materials such as sets
of slides.</p><p>
You may present the first three elements in a unified essay or in separate
sections. Whatever organization you devise, the discussion of objectives
and strategies must be in prose, and must constitute at least two-thirds
of your completed unit. Outlines, lists, and worksheets, when included,
belong in the section devoted to classroom activities. In selecting
examples of classroom activities, you should present methods you have
developed, rather than those gleaned from other sources. Considered
together,<the a="" in="" methods.<p="" of="" prepared="" reflect="" seminar="" should="" units="" variety="" your="">
Remember that the main audience for your unit is other teachers. The
presentation of work-in-progress in Institute seminars will provide you
with responses from one group of teachers-ideas you can use in
revising
your unit to make it as widely useful as possible.<br/>
<br/>
</the></p><h4>Use of Copyrighted Materials</h4>
If you want to include in your curriculum unit excerpts (i.e., passages
exceeding a very few lines) from copyrighted material, you should first
obtain permission from the copyright owner. If use of such material is not
granted free of charge, you must also obtain advance approval from the
Institute for paying any fees. Copyrighted material must be properly
credited in a footnote. The Institute cannot accept units which contain
copyrighted material for which you have not obtained prior authorization.
Because of the delays you may encounter in obtaining permission from
copyright owners, you should seek such permission well in advance of
completing your unit. We suggest you write for such permissions while
preparing your first draft. For further information, please consult the
detailed instructions and forms we provide for obtaining copyright
permissions.
<h4>The Completed Unit</h4>
Final units must be submitted by July 31 to your seminar leader, not to
the Institute office. The unit must be accompanied by the cover sheet and
proposed indexing form. Within two weeks Institute faculty members will
review and then forward completed units to the director, indicating
whether each Fellow has participated fully in the seminar and the writing
process. Your written evaluation and request for any classroom materials
you are asking the Institute to order should be submitted to the Institute
office by August 15.<p>
Upon successful completion of the seminar and the unit, and after the
Institute has received your evaluation, Fellows who are in good standing
will be mailed an honorarium of $1000 and may renew their University
identification and library cards for the balance of a year. Fellows should
not expect these checks to be mailed before August 15. They may also
petition for certification of their course of study. Any Fellow who
intends
to seek for Institute studies to be recognized for credit in a degree
program is advised to consult in advance with the dean of the institution
where he or she is enrolled.</p>
