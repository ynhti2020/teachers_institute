<i>Caliban:</i>
<p>
This island’s mine, by Sycorax my mother
<br/>
Which thou tak’st from me. When thou cam’st first,
<br/>
Thou strok’st me, and made much of me; wouldst give me
<br/>
Water with berries in’t; and teach me how
<br/>
To name the bigger light, and how the less,
<br/>
That burn by day and night; and then I lov’d thee,
<br/>
And show’d thee all the qualities o’ th’ isle,
<br/>
The fresh springs, brine pits, barren place and fertile:
<br/>
Curs’d be that I did so! . . .

I . . . took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
<br/>
One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,

Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
<br/>
A thing most brutish, I endowed thy purposes
<br/>
With words that made them known . . .

</p></blockquote>
Shakespeare demonstrates in a few lines the essence of the seemingly
endless and controversial debate regarding second-language acquisition. On
a positive note, the playwright captures the give and take of cultural
exchange, the delight in sharing totally
new experiences, in renaming and redefining objects and ideas. But
Shakespeare’s genius comes in showing us the dark side, the often
patronizing tone, the loss of self which results when the new language is
considered by the instructor and/or the populat ion at large to be
superior to the native one.  <p> As an E.S.O.L. (English to Speakers of
Other Languages) teacher to 6th, 7th, and 8th grade Hispanic students in
the Bilingual Department at Roberto Clemente Middle School and Fellow in
the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute seminar “Writings and Re-Writing s
of the Discovery and Conquest of America” by Roberto González Echevarría,
I find the connections between<i> The Tempest,</i> our readings on the
Conquest,
and language teaching/learning to be intriguing. Our seminar has explored
the major texts which announce,
describe, and interpret the Discovery and Conquest of the New World
including works by Christopher Columbus, Hernán Cortés, Bernal Díaz del
Castillo, Cabeza de Vaca, Bartolomé de las Casas, Michel de Montaigne,
Garcilaso de la Vega el Inca, Roberto Ferná ndez Retamar, and the
anonymous native writers included in the volume <i>The Broken
Spears.</i></p><p>
The attempts by totally different peoples to communicate is, I feel, one
of the major themes of <i>The Tempest,</i> making its connection to second
language acquisition relevant. While reading the various accounts of the
Conquest, I have written endless notes in
the margins regarding communication between conqueror and conquered
including references to interpreters, translation, signs and other
non-verbal expressions, native languages and dialects, and definitions of
terms. These elements in the chronicles coupled with themes in The
Tempest to which Caribbean-born Hispanic students can relate—island life,
storms, shipwrecks, magic—are the structure upon which this unit is based.
References to the historical works will be included when they parallel the
particular scenes extracted from <i>The Tempest</i> in order to illustrate
the
similarities between the chronicles and Shakespeare’s work. Since the
historical documents are easily available in Spanish, teachers might
consider having students literate in Spanish read the se in the original
to facilitate comprehension. Obviously some of the references are not
within students’ grasp; they are included however if the teacher wishes to
paraphrase what I consider relevant background material for critical
analysis.</p><p>
In the transitional Bilingual classroom there is a delicate balance, when
teaching English, between imparting communication skills in the new
language and encouraging students to express pride in their native tongue
through speaking, reading, and writing. 
This curriculum unit has been designed to promote critical thinking by
posing the following questions related to the point-of-contact between
cultures. Students and teachers alike may analyze the similarities and
differences between the dynamics of the t eacher/learner in The Tempest
and their own educational experiences:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-What do you think happened between Caliban and the Europeans,
Prospero
and Miranda, when, according to them, he was first instructed to speak?
</dt><dt>-Had Caliban and his mother, Sycorax, communicated with each other during the 12 years they lived together before she was banished?
</dt><dt>-Does Miranda consider Caliban’s sounds “gabble” (Act I, Scene ii, l. 357) because she doesn’t understand them?
</dt><dt>-Might Caliban think that Prospero’s and Miranda’s utterances are gabble?
</dt><dt>-When you are first exposed to a new language, does it sound like gabble?
</dt><dt>-Does it sound like gabble after you are exposed to it over a period of time?
</dt><dt>-How might <i>The Tempest</i> have been different if Prospero and
Miranda
had recognized Caliban’s utterances as a valid system of communication and had attempted to learn his language as he had learned theirs?
</dt><dt>-How do you think Caliban would have felt about this?
</dt><dt>-Should the direction of language instruction be one-way only, from teacher to student, or can students impart knowledge to teachers?
</dt><dt>-What happens to Caliban’s native tongue now that he has no opportunity to use it?
</dt><dt>-How do you think Caliban feels about this?
</dt><dt>-What would happen to your native language if you had no chance to use it?
</dt><dt>-How would you feel about this?
</dt></dl>
Suggestions for lesson plans, class discussions, and homework assignments
are included in the unit. Activities include films and poetry in addition
to map skills, theater games and oral exercises. There is also an emphasis
on isolating the technical drama tic elements found in the text. This
concentration on costumes, sound, lighting, and scenery encourages
students to focus on the play from the point of view of the stage
technician.<p>
It is obvious that reading <i>The Tempest</i> in its entirety is a very
sophisticated task for even the average native English-speaking student
and for this reason only relatively simple passages will be cited. An
appreciation for Shakespeare often requires year s of careful cultivation
and begins by elemental familiarization with the sounds of the words, even
if the meanings are obscured. I believe there is an advantage with
beginning English speakers in that students are not yet aware of the
unfamiliar words an d awkward sentence construction with which many native
speakers are uncomfortable almost immediately.</p><p>
Since the level of English skills is relatively low for transitional
students who have had 2-4 years of E.S.O.L. instruction, I would suggest
introducing <i>The Tempest</i> by recounting the play first in narrative
form, using a guide such as Charles and Mary Lamb’s <i>Tales from
Shakespeare,</i> specifically tailored and illustrated for children. This
synopsis could be followed by viewing the British Broadcasting
Corporation’s film, <i>The Tempest. Forbidden Planet,</i> a 1950s science
fiction
version of <i>The Tempest</i> with Walter Pidgeon and Ann Francis, might
be an
interesting and enjoyable comparison for students. However, before
familiarizing themselves with the films, the book illustrations, or even
the book cover to the Arden edition, I feel it is important for students t
o formulate their own concepts, particularly with regard to the depiction
of Caliban. Teachers can introduce this character as someone who looks and
speaks differently from society as a whole and then ask the class to
speculate on his appearance and perso nality. Since these particular
students have had personal experiences dealing with an unfamiliar culture
they will probably be able to relate to the problem posed by Shakespeare.
Students might then begin to understand Caliban’s monster-like depiction
in the eyes of the Europeans as a possible exaggeration of the truth since
he does not fit into their particular mold, and to analyze judgments
placed upon people in contemporary society under similar circumstances.</p><p>
After students have listened to a narrative version of <i>The Tempest</i>
and/or
viewed the films, they could then be introduced to the possible historical
basis of the story. It would be helpful at this point to make maps
available to compare the world at the t ime of the Conquest to the
present. (The December 1977 <i>National Geographic</i> “Colonization and
Trade in
the New World”.) Milan, Naples, and Bermuda could be clearly labelled to
familiarize the class with locations mentioned in the play.</p><p>
Shakespeare’s story is believed to have been based on the separation
during a storm of one of nine ships in a fleet which left England in 1609
with John Smith’s Virginia colony as its destination. The colonists were
marooned on an island and arrived in Virginia a year later after word of
the wreck and possible demise of the colonists had reached England.
Scholars believe that Shakespeare was familiar with these accounts as he
was personally acquainted with members of the Virginia Company.</p><p>
A brief analysis of the title of the play might follow (a more detailed
treatment follows in Act I, Scene i). Certainly teachers who have come
into contact with Hispanic children newly arrived from the Caribbean are
familiar with their detailed accounts of personal experiences with
hurricanes. Students could be encouraged to relate these impressions,
either orally or in written form, thus appreciating the relevance of the
play to their own lives.</p><p>
While becoming familiar with the list of characters, students can make
another obvious connection between themselves and Shakespeare’s choice of
Latin-based names. Prospero labels the island’s inhabitant “Caliban”,
derived from the word “Carib”, the nativ e group believed by some to have
ritually eaten human flesh (“cannibal”). Students can be asked at this
point to consider what this character’s real name might have been and how
they themselves feel when labelled with an uncomplimentary nickname. The
orig in of the name Caliban could be illustrated by reading the following
account by Christopher Columbus in his journal. On Sunday, November 4,
1492, less than a month after he arrived in the New World, the following
entry appears:</p>
<blockquote>He learned also that far from the place there were men with
one eye and
others with dogs’ muzzles who ate human beings.2</blockquote>
And on November 23, this account:
<blockquote>. . . On it (Haiti) lived people who had only one eye and
others called
cannibals, of whom they seemed to be very afraid.3</blockquote>
A contemporary response to Columbus’ account comes in an essay by Roberto
Fernández Retamar in which he states:
<blockquote>The colonizer’s version explains to us that owing to his
irremediable
bestiality, there was no alternative to the extermination of the Carib . .
. and in Shakespeare, Caliban is a savage and deformed slave who cannot be
degraded enough . . . As for the co ncrete man, present him in the guise
of an animal, rob him of his land, enslave him so as to live from his
toil, and at the right moment, exterminate him; this latter, of course,
only as long as there was someone who could be depended on to perform the
ar duous tasks in his stead.4</blockquote>
Another reference to the barbaric connotation associated with the name
Caliban comes in Montaigne’s essay “On Cannibals” which appeared in 1580
and was one of the most widely disseminated European Utopian works.
Giovanni Floro’s English translation of the
essays was published in 1603. Not only was Floro a personal friend of
Shakespeare, but the copy of the translation that Shakespeare owned and
annotated is still preserved and is considered one of the inspirations
behind <i>The Tempest.</i> Montaigne states:
<blockquote>. . . there is nothing barbaric or savage in these nations . . 
. what happens is that everyone calls what is foreign to his own customs
‘barbarian’.5</blockquote>
Students can respond to the above quotes by supplying their own
impressions to unfamiliar people or experiences. Or, if they are
comfortable enough with the teacher and fellow classmates, they might
relate personal feelings associated with conflicting cul tural values when
they are considered “foreign” by the society at large in their new
environment.

<h3>Act I, Scene i</h3>
Since the primary means of creating the illusion of action on shipboard in
Shakespeare’s work was suggestive noise and termninology, before showing
students Shakespeare’s initial stage directions—
<blockquote>(On a ship at sea): a tempestuous noise of thunder and
lightning heard (ll. 1-2)</blockquote> <blockquote>An hour after I left, the sea began to
rise ominously and the north wind blow so violently that the two boats
would not have dared come near land . . . All hands labored severely under
a heavy fall of water that entire day and until dark on Sunday. By the n
the rain and the tempest had stepped up until there was as much agitation
in the town as at sea. All the houses and churches came down. We had to
walk seven or eight together, locking arms, to keep from being blown
away.6</blockquote>
The second is considered to be an exaggeration of the truth and is known as the “Myth of the Lost Pilot”. It was used to disclaim Columbus’ contention of having been the first European to set foot in the New World since the power and financial rewards he 
would personally reap would minimize the control of the Spanish crown:
<blockquote>. . . a pilot . . . called Alonso Sánchez de Huelva . . . had
a small
ship with which he traded by sea and used to carry wares from Spain to the Canaries . . . while pursuing this trade . . . he ran into a squall so heavy and tempestuous that he could not
withstand it . . . The crew suffered great hardships in the storm for they could neither eat nor sleep. After this lengthy period the wind fell and they found themselves near an island. It is not known for sure which it was, but it is suspected that it w
as the one now called Santo Domingo.7</blockquote>
The last two quotations are taken from an account of the Conquest by the
Aztecs themselves. Broken Spears is a collection of native New World
reactions to the events they witnessed first hand. Here we see hints of
Prospero’s command to Ariel to unleash th e tempest:
<blockquote>Motecuhzoma had sent the magicians to learn what sort of
people the
strangers might be, but they were also to see if they could work some
charm against them or do them some mischief. They might be able to direct
a harmful wind against them . . . The magic ians carried out their mission
against the Spaniards, but they failed completely. They could not harm
them in any way.8</blockquote>
Students can now read lines 1-17, 34-50, and 58-66 from The Tempest in
order to dramatize Shakespeare’s expertise in depicting the terror of the
storm to those aboard ship. Throughout this approach to the play, if the
words or concepts seem too difficult for students, the teacher can isolate
one line at a time and the individual character or the class as a whole
can respond by patterning their oral response after the teacher’s. If the
instructor delivers the words correctly in terms of pitch and tone, stu
dents should get a sense of what is being said, even if each word is not
fully understood. Students could then be asked to paraphrase, with the
teacher’s assistance, in order to test for comprehension.

<h3>Act I, Scene ii</h3>
The setting is now the island on which Caliban, Sycorax his mother (now
banished), and Ariel had been living before Prospero and Miranda’s arrival
twelve years earlier (Miranda is now fifteen years old). Creating the mood
for this scene might take the for m of a class discussion or written
assignment pertaining to the differences between island and mainland
living, since Hispanic students will have had personal experiences with
both. Before reading the section referring to Gonzalo’s having gathered
the nec essary provisions for Prospero and Miranda upon their flight from
Italy—
<blockquote>Some food we had, and some fresh water, that
<br/>
A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
<br/>
Out of his charity, who being then appointed
<br/>
Master of this design, did give us, with
<br/>
Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries . . . 
<br/><br/>
(ll. 160-167)
</blockquote>
—students can imagine themselves in a similar situation in that specific
time period and consider what manageable personal items they would have
hurriedly thrown together for such an unexpected departure. My most
cherished memories of grammar school revol ve around the following
exercise related to geography lessons. Our teacher would announce that we
would be “traveling” the next day to a specific part of the world and
after telling us a bit about its location and climate, assign us the task
of “packing a
suitcase”—i.e. cutting out pictures from magazines of whatever we felt
was necessary for the trip—and the next day we’d be strapped into our
“seatbelts” on our “airplane,” “passports” in hand, and be off!
Photocopied pictures from historical costume book s would be helpful here
for the clothing they might carry. Regarding the characters’ departure
from Italy in The Tempest, students should consider that this might be a
permanent situation and that Prospero does not use his magical powers
until they reach the island. This should inspire students to select items
carefully and to anticipate the problems the characters might encounter on
their journey. 
<p>
When Prospero reaches the island he is “rapt in secret studies” (ll.
75-76) with the books Gonzalo has supplied:</p>
<blockquote>Prospero:
<br/>
From mine own library with volumes that
<br/>
I prize above my dukedom.
<br/>
(ll. 167-168)
</blockquote>
Students might enjoy creating booklets with magical symbols and secret
codes to help them imagine the power that Prospero reaps from there
documents.<p>
Scene ii contains a poignant interchange between father and daughter in
which Prospero finally explains to Miranda the circumstances surrounding
their present existence. Lines 15-25 and 33-46 serve to give the class a
clearer understanding of the characte rs’ plight; the following lines are
particularly vivid and would probably leave a lasting impression on
students of the hardships Prospero and Miranda faced:</p>
<blockquote>. . . they prepared
<br/>
a rotten carcass of a butt not rigg’d
<br/>
Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
<br/>
Instinctively have quit it . . . 
<br/>
(ll. 145-150)
</blockquote>
Miranda’s first memories of her childhood are hazy when Prospero asks here
in line 49, “What seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time?”
Students and teachers alike could be encouraged to think back carefully to
their earliest memories in ord er to recount them either orally or in
written form.<p>
Prospero tells Miranda that he has released the tempest through Ariel’s
intervention and with the magical powers of his robe. He asks Miranda to
“pluck my magic garment from me” (l. 24) when he no longer needs control,
and students might begin to envision
the qualities of this article of clothing by producing a costume sketch.
A collection of fabric scraps, especially glitzy ones, would help spark
their creativity. Students can attach small fabric swatches along the
bottom and sides of the drawing, as is the practice of professional
costume designers, in order to suggest color and texture.</p><p>
Lines 226-237 provide the only specific reference to Bermuda in the entire
play and students could read the historical reference to the Bermuda
Pamphlets described at the beginning of this unit.</p><p>
Prospero, in his dialogue with Miranda, recounts their initial encounter
with Caliban twelve years earlier. This, to me, is the first reference in
the play related to second language acquisition and communication between
two cultures, and for this reason I feel it warrants a detailed analysis.
The first image we have of Caliban is Prospero’s description:</p>
<blockquote>. . . A freckled whelp hag born—not honour’d
<br/>
with a human shape . . .  Dull thing, I say so . . . 
<br/>
(ll. 282-284)
</blockquote>
We see the encounter from Caliban’s perspective in the lines quoted at the
beginning of the unit (l .332-341; 355-359) and it would be an opportunity
now to review these and their meaning with the students. This quote, in
conjunction with lines 310-315 in
which Prospero extols the virtues of Caliban’s native intelligence and
hard work, provides a basis for discussion of the necessary components for
survival in the wild. The foreigners are dependent upon Caliban for their
livelihood, yet subjugate and ensl ave him:
<blockquote>We cannot miss him: he does make our fire
<br/>
Fetch in our wood, and serves in offices
<br/>
That profit us . . . 
<br/>
(ll.311-315)
</blockquote>
There is an interesting parallel in Cortes’ letter to the king regarding
the natives living near Tascalteca:
<blockquote>In a letter of mine I informed Your Majesty how the natives
of these parts
are of much greater intelligence than those of other islands . . . indeed
they appeared to us to possess such understanding as is sufficient for an
ordinary citizen to conduct hims elf in a civilized country. It seemed to
me therefore, a serious matter at this time to compel them to serve the
Spaniards as the natives of the other islands do; yet if this were not
done, the conquerors and settlers of these parts would not be able to m
aintain themselves.9</blockquote>
We have read Columbus’ account of rumored cannibals in the area. Here is
the entry regarding his initial attempts to communicate with the
natives:
<blockquote>On my arrival at that sea, I had taken some Indians by force
from the
first island that I came to, in order that they might learn our language, and communicate to us what they knew respecting the country . . . in a short time, either by gesture and signs,
or by words, we were enabled to understand each other.10</blockquote>
The class could be divided into two groups at this point—natives and
conquerors. Having prepared a list of the qualities of their island, the
natives, through “gestures and signs” could attempt to communicate these
to the foreigners.<p>
The illustrations contained in this curriculum unit are by two students at
Betsy Ross Arts Magnet School, Gabriel Arvelo, a 6th grader, and Joel
Johnstone, an 8th grader. These are based on adaptations of original
codices paintings by Alberto Beltran in T he Broken Spears. This first
drawing and excerpt from the text are included here to draw parallels to
The Tempest and to imagine Caliban’s initial reaction to the Europeans:</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Drawing by Gabriel Arvelo11</p><p>
An emissary had been sent by Montezuma to validate reports that natives
had seen “two towers or small mountains floating on the waves of the
sea’’12 and the following is their eyewitness account:</p>
<blockquote> 
‘Our lord and king, it is true that strange people have come
to the shores of the great sea . . . There were about fifteen of these
people, some with blue jackets, others with black or green, and still
others with jackets of a soiled color, very ugly, lik e our ichtilmatli .
. . they have very light skin, much lighter than ours. They all have long
beards, and their hair comes only to their ears.’ Montezuma was downcast
when he heard this report, and did not speak a word.13</blockquote>
Since these particular students have had the experience in their lives of
encountering a culture and language different from their own, the
following suggestion for a theater game might help them to recall that
initial point-of-contact and the inevitable frustration and
misunderstanding which result. Some Hispanic students are well versed in
“jerigonza” in which words are divided into syllables and each syllable
prefaced with the same sound, for example “chi”. This new language is
spoken rapidly and I am totally baffled whenever I hear it! If a student
with this skill (pretending not to understand English or Spanish) were to
confront the teacher or another student with no knowledge of jerigonza,
this might simulate the initial encounter between Caliban an d the
foreigners. The class could formulate questions which might naturally
develop from this situation and help the two actors consider non-verbal
methods of communication.<p>
The following quotes from the chronicles pertain to communication between
two cultures, further emphasizing the historical antecedents and their
relevance. Students can be encouraged to reenact these three situations in
the “jeringoza” theater game descri bed above. The first quote from
Garcilaso de la Vega el Inca recounts the story of an Indian named Beru
who encountered the Spaniards on the banks of the river Pelu:</p>
<blockquote>The Spaniards asked him by signs and words what land it was
and what it was called. The Indian understood that they were asking him
something from the gestures and grimaces they were making with hands and
face, as if they were addressing a dumb man, but h e did not understand
what they were asking, so he told them what he thought they wanted to
know. The Christians understood what they wanted to understand . . . and
from that time they called that rich and great empire Peru, corrupting
both words, as the S paniards corrupt almost all the words they take from
the Indian language . . . 14</blockquote>
Students and teachers alike have probably experienced similar
misunderstandings in communication and it might be insightful here to
discuss some of these twisted interpretations.<p>
The next two quotes are taken from Cabeza de Vaca’s account:</p>
<blockquote>The Indians of the village returned next day and approached
us. Because we had no interpreter, we could only make out what they said;
but their many signs and threats left little doubt that they were bidding
us to go.15</blockquote>
Students can contemplate what might have been said and attempt to
communicate their thoughts non-verbally or through the “jerigonza”
exercise above.<p>
And we taught all the people by signs, which they understood, that in
Heaven was a Man called God, who had created the heavens and earth; that
all good came from Him and that we worshipped and obeyed Him and called
Him our Lord; and that if they would do the same, all would be well with
them. They apprehended us so readily that if we had had enough command of
their language to make ourselves perfectly understood, we would have left
them all Christians.16
A conflicting report is mentioned in Robert Ricard’s book, The Spiritual
Conquest of Mexico, as he describes the attempts of Munoz Camargo and
other clerics to instruct the natives in Christianity:</p>
<blockquote>. . . the religious could only indicate the existence of
heaven and hell.  To suggest hell they pointed to the earth, fire, toads
and snakes. Then they raised their eyes, pointed to heaven and spoke of a
single God. The Indians barely understood.17</blockquote>
Many Hispanic students are familiar with the beliefs of the Afro-Caribbean
“Santeria” religious cult. Assuming that the teacher is not and by using
only signs and “jerigonza”, students could attempt to “convert” the
teacher into this belief system and dec ide at the end of the exercise if
their communication was successful.<p>
Ariel’s song to Fernando (l. 399Ð405) in which he falsely implies to the
prince that his father, Alonso, has died in the shipwreck, is an
opportunity for those students interested in music to explore the
technical possibilities within the play. The piece is included in the
Arden edition and a simple flute recording with the assistance of the
music teacher would add a nice touch here. (On page opposite)18</p><p>
In addition, students interested in scenic art could sketch their
interpretation of these lines. Students are provided with two additional
challenges to their creativity by considering solutions to the following
stage directions included in this scene:</p><p>
<blockqoute> re-enter Ariel like a water nymph <br/> (l. 317)  <br/>
re-enter Ariel invisible, playing and singing <br. (l.="" 377)="" <="" blockquote=""> <i>(figure available in print form)</i> </br.></blockqoute></p><p> The scene
ends (l. 413-470) with Miranda’s first glimpse of Fernando under the
careful supervision of her father, who, as powerful as he is, cannot
control their mutual attraction. Miranda challenges her father’s negative
response to Fernando and what ens ues is the age-old generational conflict
to which students can easily relate:</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Miranda:</i>
<br/>
. . . I might call him (Fernando)
<br/>
A thing divine; for nothing natural I ever saw so
<br/>
noble.
<br/>
(ll. 419-421)
<p>
<i>Prospero:</i>
<br/>
. . . At the first sight
<br/>
They have chang’d eyes . . . 
<br/>
(ll. 443-444)
</p><p>
<i>Miranda:</i>
<br/>
. . . This
<br/>
Is the third man that e’er I saw . . . 
<br/>
(ll. 447-448)
</p><p>
<i>Fernando:</i>
<br/>
O, if a virgin,
<br/>
And your affection not gone forth,
<br/>
I’ll make you The Queen of Naples.
<br/>
(ll. 450-452)
</p><p>
<i>Prospero:</i>
<br/>
. . . Come;
<br/>
I’ll manacle thy neck and feet together,
<br/>
Sea-water shalt thou drink . . . 
<br/>
(ll. 463-464)
</p><p>
<i>Miranda:</i>
<br/>
O dear father,
<br/>
Make not too rash a trial of him, for
<br/>
He’s gentle, and not fearful.
<br/>
(ll. 468-470)

Students can note here the change in tone of the supposedly cultured

<h3>Act II, Scene i</h3>
The act opens on another part of the island in which the remaining members
of the fleet have been marooned. Lines 45-53 are a comical interchange
between four of the characters concerning their impressions, both positive
and negative, of the island. The f ollowing entry describing Cuba from
Columbus’ journal might be discussed here:
<blockquote>This said island of Juana is exceedingly fertile . . . it is
surrounded
by many bays . . . surpassing any that I have ever seen; numerous large and healthful rivers intersect it, and it also contains many very lofty mountains . . . all these islands are v
ery beautiful . . . they are filled with a great variety of trees of immense height . . . some of them were blossoming, some bearing fruit . . . The nightingale and various birds were singing in countless numbers, and that in November, the month in which 
I arrived there. There are . . . seven or eight kinds of palm trees . . . 19
</blockquote>
Students could be asked to draw these different varieties of palm trees
from memory and also to compare the flora and fauna of Puerto Rico with
the mainland. A dialogue might be improvised in which one actor paints a
favorable picture of the new environment while another gives an
unfavorable one.<p>
The scene has several costume references (l. 59, 66, 93, 266), and the
following illustrations can be analyzed, paying particular attention to
the depiction of the Spaniards. From the point of view of the costume
designer, students might consider the alte rations the characters would
make to their garments now that weather conditions have probably changed
from those in Italy:</p><p>

<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Lines 143-151 describe Gonzalo’s idea of a Utopian life style on the
island and the pronouncements he would make if he were king. Students can
consider their own suggestions for an ideal world and come up with a
personal list.</p><p>
Shakespeare gives us several references (between lines 180-320) to
dream-like spells experienced by some of the characters. Students might
search this section independently to list these phrases. In their reading
(l. 295-300) they will once again happen u pon Ariel working his magic
through song as he attempts to awaken Gonzalo from slumber. There is no
musical notation available for this particular piece, thus providing
interested students the opportunity to develop their own accompaniment
which best corr esponds to the sense of the words.</p>

<h3>Act II, Scene ii</h3>
The act begins with the technical note, “A noise of thunder heard,” (l.
1.) followed by a passage by Trincolo in which he vividly describes the
storm (ll. 18-24). A modified version of the exercises suggested at the
beginning of the analysis of the play t o simulate hurricane conditions
could be used now to draw students into the mood of the scene.<p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
<br/>
Drawing by Joel Johnstone20 </p><p>
The continuation of Trincolo’s discourse on
the brewing storm and its relationship to the historical references in the
chronicles can be considered here. Trincolo describes his first encounter
with Caliban and immediately consi ders capitalizing on his “otherness” in
the same manner chosen by Pedro Serrano, the shipwrecked Spaniard vividly
described by Garcilaso de la Vega el Inca in his Commentaries. Serrano’s
plight, having spent seven years on a desolate island, is worth read ing
here for the pure theatricality of this adventure story. The following
excerpt from this chronicle (three years into his dilemma another
shipwrecked Spaniard joins Serrano, and four years later they are rescued
by a passing ship) might prove insightfu l. Students can consider that
Caliban’s “monstrous” appearance was probably a natural adaptive reaction
to his environment:</p><p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
<br/>
Drawing by Joel Johnstone</p>
<blockquote>Owing to the harshness of the climate hair grew all over his
body till it
was like an animal’s pelt . . . His hair and beard fell below his waist .
. . Pedro Serrano and his companion, who had grown a similar pelt, seeing
the boat approach, fell to saying
that Credo . . . so that the sailors should not think they were demons
and flee from them . . . They no longer looked like human beings . . .
Pedro Serrano reached here (Spain) and went on to Germany where the
emperor then was . . . In every village he p assed through on the way he
earned much money whenever he chose to exhibit himself.21</blockquote>
The second quote from The Tempest parallels Garcilaso’s account as Stefano
plans to capitalize on Caliban’s “otherness”:
<blockquote><i>Trincolo:</i>
<br/>
What have we here? a man or a fish? . . . Were I in
<br/>
England now, and had but this fish painted, not
<br/>
a holiday fool there but would give a piece of
<br/>
silver; there would this monster make a man:
<br/>
when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
<br/>
beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead Indian . . . 
<br/>
(ll. 25-34)
<p>
<i>Stephano:</i>
<br/>
If I can recover him and keep him tame and get
<br/>
to Naples with him, he’s a present for any em-
<br/>
peror that ever trod on neat’s leather (cowhide).
<br/>
(ll. 67-70)
</p></blockquote>
Students will probably have many stories to tell of their experiences with
circus “freak” shows, movies and television programs in response to the
above quotes. They might want to consider themselves in a similar
situation and explore the deeper feelings of “the other” in order to see
it from a different perspective.<p>
This act also contains a reference to the native belief that the Spaniards
were an incarnation of the gods of their legends. The first quote refers
to Columbus’ perception of the people in present-day Santo Domingo and the
second is Stephano’s response to
Caliban’s curiosity:</p>
<blockquote>. . . They practice no kind of idolatry, but have a firm
belief that all strength and power, and indeed all good things, are in
heaven, and that I had descended from thence with these ships and sailors
. . . 22
<p>
<i>Caliban:</i>
<br/>
Hast thou not dropp’d from heaven?
</p><p>
<i>Stephano:</i>
<br/>
Out o’ the moon, I do assure thee.
<br/>
I was the man i’ th’ moon when time was.
</p><p>
<i>Caliban:</i>
<br/>
I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee . . .
<br/>
(ll. 135-140)
</p></blockquote>
The end of Scene ii finds Caliban, under the influence of the wine that
has been forced upon him by Stephano and Trinculo, deciding to change
allegiance and to take them, instead of Prospero, for his masters. Caliban
sadly mistakes for freedom what is act ually just another form of
servitude and slavery. The dialogue which proceeds from line 148 until the
end of the scene again graphically depicts Caliban’s innate knowledge of
natural lore and his willingness to share this with the very people who
enslave him. The following lines are particularly graphic:
<blockquote><i>Caliban:</i>
<br/>
I’ll show thee the best springs; I’ll pluck thee
<br/>
berries, I’ll fish for thee and get thee wood
<br/>
enough.
<br/>
(ll. 160-162)
<p>
<i>Caliban:</i>
<br/>
. . . let me bring thee where crabs grow;
<br/>
And I with my long nails will dig thee pig nuts;
<br/>
Show thee a jay’s nest and instruct thee how
<br/>
To snare the nimble marmoset [monkey];
<br/>
I’ll bring thee
<br/>
To clustering filberts and sometimes I’ll get thee
<br/>
Young scamels [a type of shellfish]
<br/>
from the rock
<br/>
(ll. 168-172)
</p></blockquote>
Since many of the students who make up the bilingual population in New
Haven come from the rural areas of the Caribbean, they might enjoy
comparing and contrasting their knowledge of the natural wonders of island
life with Caliban’s.

<h3>Act III, Scene i</h3>
The love between Fernando and Miranda is expressed verbally in this short
scene. Since most of the language is very sophisticated, these relatively
simple lines (ll. 6-9, 20-21, 31-36, 45-51, 58-60, 63-65, 67-68, 72-74,

This scene takes place on another part of the island as Caliban, Stephano and Trinculo plot to kill Prospero, with Ariel in the background trying to undermine their intentions. The language of lines 40-111 is basically simple, and students could mimic the

This scene provides a wealth of opportunities for students interested in
technical theater as the storm wells up again and a banquet strangely
disappears. In addition to scenic, costume, lighting and properties notes,
there are references to music and cho reography and to the elements of
Ariel’s magic. Students could divide the following stage directions into
their corresponding components and decide as technicians in their
particular fields what the best solutions would be. They might also
consider the di fferences between a staged and a film version in order to
compare the possibilities and limitations of both media: 
<blockquote>Solemn and strange music, and Prospero on the top (invisible).
Enter
several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; and dance about it with
gentle actions of salutations; and inviting the king and company to eat,
they depart. 
<br/>
(ll. 16-21)
<p>
Thunder and lightning. Enter Ariel like a Harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes.
<br/>
(ll. 51-54)
</p><p>
Ariel vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table.
<br/>
(ll. 82-85)
</p></blockquote>
This scene also contains a description of the islanders by Gonzalo which
parallels an entry in Bartolomé de las Casas, and students might consider
the similarities in both accounts as a basis for a class discussion and/or
a written assignment. Regarding t he natives of Hispaniola (Santo
Domingo), las Casas states:
<blockquote>. . . these people are the most guileless, the most devoid of
wickedness . . . They are by nature the most humble, patient, and
peaceable, holding no grudges . . . neither excitable nor quarrelsome . .
. The sons of nobles among us, brought up in the enjo yments of life’s
refinements, are no more delicate than are these Indians . . . 23

<h3>Act IV, Scene i</h3>
A wealth of song and poetry characterizes this scene as the element of the
masque is introduced. For those students who enjoy poetry, this would be a
good opportunity to repeat the lines after the teacher and to discuss the
meaning and content of each poe m. A memorization homework assignment
might follow. These verses include Ariel’s poem (ll. 42-47), Juno’s song
describing her marriage blessing (ll. 105-110), Ceres’ hopes for the
bestowal of rich harvests (ll. 111-116), and Iris’ call to the nymphs (ll.
127-138). 
<p>
There are several references to clothing here, presenting yet another
chance for students to analyze the play from the costumer’s perspective
and sketch the corresponding designs. These include the following:</p>
<blockquote>
-Enter certain Reapers, properly habited
<br/>
(l. 138)
<p>
-(re)enter Ariel, loaden with glistening apparel
<br/>
(l. 192)
</p><p>
-Enter Caliban, Stephano, and Trinculo, all wet

(l. 194)
</p><p>
<i>Trinculo:</i>
<br/>
O, King Stephano!
<br/>
. . . look what a wardrobe here is for thee!
<br/>
(ll. 222-223)

<h3>Act V, Scene i</h3>
This, the last act in the play, illustrates Prospero’s humanity in
pardoning his brother and his skill at restoring his lost power. Fernando
and his father are reunited, Ariel gains his liberty, having successfully
carried out Prospero’s wishes, and Prosp0ero extends this freedom to
Caliban who regrets having subjected himself to Stephano, “this dull fool”
(l. 297). Prospero and the foreigners plan their voyage back to Italy,
where Fernando and Miranda will wed. <p> Shakespeare does not give us any
indication here of Caliban’s response to the foreigners’ exodus from the
island. Is he happy that they’re leaving? Will he miss these people even
though he has been subjugated by them? How do students think this new
language and worldly knowledge have altered his perceptions? It might be
interesting to imagine that Caliban travels back to Italy with the
Europeans in the light of the following quote from Montaigne, his account
of a native of the New World’s visit to Europe:  </p>
<blockquote> Three of these people . . . were at Rouen at the time that
the late King Charles the Ninth was there . . . and they were shown our
fashions, our pomp, and the form of a fair city. After that someone wanted
to know what they had found most to be admired . . . They said . . . that
they had observed that there were among us men crammed with all kinds of
good things while their halves were begging at their door, emaciated with
hunger and poverty; and that they thought it strange that these needy
halves did
not take the others by the throat or set fire to their houses.24
</blockquote>
Students can observe here several references to the magical qualities of
Prospero’s robes and to his donning of the garments, including his “hat
and rapier,” (l. 118) which he wore in Italy, symbolizing his
relinquishing of power. The charm is extinguishe d when he states:
<blockquote>. . . I’ll break my staff
<br/>
Bury it certain fadoms in the earth,
<br/>
And deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll
<br/>
drown my book.
<br/>
(ll. 54-57)
</blockquote>
As an exercise students can dramatize the stage direction which reads:
<blockquote>. . . they (Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, Adrian,
<br/>
Francisco) all enter the circle which Prospero
<br/>
had made, and there stand charm’d
<br/>
(ll. 56-58)
</blockquote>
They can then react to Prospero’s statement:
<blockquote>
. . . There stand, for you are spell-stopp’d
<br/>(ll. 60-61)
</blockquote>
Prospero grants Ariel his much desired liberty and Ariel’s song (ll.
88-93) describes his delight in controlling his life once again. The
musical notation is included in the Arden edition, and a class sing-along
might follow with simple live or taped accompaniment:25<p>
<i>(figure available in print form)</i>
</p><p>
Encourage students to contemplate what they would enjoy doing if they
found themselves in Ariel’s situation, tasting freedom after a long period
of subjugation. Their thoughts could be transposed into the text of a
song, using the same tune as Ariel’s.</p>

<h3>Epilogue</h3>
Before showing the script to the class, the teacher could read the
Epilogue aloud, omitting the last rhyming word in every other line. Thus
students will hear the first clue—the last word of the first line—and will
supply the complementary rhyming word at
the end of the next line, alternating in this manner throughout the
Epilogue. This gives the teacher the chance to test students’
comprehension of the play. For example:
<blockquote>
Now my charms are all o’erthrown
<br/>
And what strength I have’s mine_____ . . . 
<p>
As you from crimes would pardon’d be,
<br/>
Let your indulgence set me_____.
<br/>
Epilogue (ll. l-2, 19-20)
</p></blockquote>
After the Epilogue has been read, teachers and students can review the major objectives of this curriculum unit to see if they have been met. Do students have an understanding of colonization as portrayed in The Tempest? Can they relate the issues associa
ted with one culture being dominated by another to other historical periods? To the present? Can they begin to question history if only one, and not multiple, perspectives are given?<p>
Students will hopefully have seen the parallels between The Tempest and the chronicles throughout the reading of the play. Are any of the references to these primary sources vivid enough for students to recount from memory? They have also been trained to 
look at a play from the point of view of the stage technician—is it easier now to spot costume, lighting, scenery, properties, and sound references?</p><p>
Lastly, the issue which I find most central, that of language and communication, can best be evaluated by returning to the questions posed at the beginning of the unit related to the point-of-contact between cultures. Hopefully students have become sensit
ized to Caliban’s plight by the end of the play. Students can discuss their initial reactions and any changes they may have felt as the play developed.</p><p>
In conclusion, this analysis of The Tempest, much of it seen from
Caliban’s perspective, illustrates the complexity of second language
acquisition and the sensitivity with which E.S.O.L. instructors in
particular approach teaching a new language while at the same time
encouraging pride in the students’ native tongue. With an appreciation for
and an understanding of different cultures and modes of expression, second
language teachers will hopefully never be blessed with Caliban’s
invective:</p>
<blockquote>You taught me language; and my profit on’t
<br/>
Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
<br/>
For learning me your language.
<br/>
Act I, Scene ii (ll. 365-367)
</blockquote>
<center>***
</center>
There have been several changes since this curriculum unit was written. I
taught it for two years to its targeted audience, intermediate and
advanced E.S.O.L. students at Roberto Clemente Middle School, mostly
Puerto Rican, and for the past three years to
mainstream (Anglo and Hispanic) 5th and 8th grade Humanities and Reading
classes in my new position as Curriculum/Staff Developer at Betsy Ross
Arts Magnet Middle School. The basic difference between the Hispanic
students in both settings is that the E.S .O.L. students are new arrivals
struggling with a new language, and the mainstream Hispanics range from
non-Spanish speakers, i.e., monolingual English (often both they and their
parents were born on the mainland and, sadly to say, no longer speak
Spanish ) to true bilinguals, equally at ease in both English and
Spanish—the many stages of Caliban’s language dilemma right before my
eyes, each at a different level of second language acquisition and first
language maintenance or demise. As a result, I believe , of their personal
experiences with second language learning, I found the Spanish speaking
E.S.O.L. and mainstream students to be more sympathetic to Caliban’s
plight than their mainstream (Anglo) or mainstream Hispanic (monolingual
English) peers. The e xceptions were those mainstream Anglo students who
were struggling with either Spanish or French in foreign language
classes.<p>
Another change is that I have taught the unit to culminate a year-long
curriculum based on primary sources (translated into English for those
students who cannot read Spanish) and other materials from the period of
the Conquest. By the last marking period , students have been exposed to
both the European and the Caribbean perspectives and can hopefully
understand the conflict in The Tempest in the context of the broader
historical period. My interest in these writings began in Professor
Echevarría’s seminar and I am currently in the beginning stages of a
doctoral dissertation in Bilingual Education at the University of
Connecticut. The focus will be the Taino/Arawak peoples, “encountered” by
Christopher Columbus and other Europeans in the Caribbean, whose culture
virtually disappeared within two generations as a result of the ensuing
conflict. The upcoming (1992) Quincentennial and the relative lack of
curricular materials based on these indigenous groups make these studies,
I feel, a necessity.</p><p>
Although I continue to use Shakespeare’s original as planned in the unit,
I have come across two excellent supplemental versions—an illustrated
comic book with student guide and cassette (Pendulum Books), and the
script adaptation by Forrest Stone (Classi c Theatre for Children). Both
are noted in the Bibliography. These can be used in addition to narrative
versions, such as the Lambs’, at the beginning of the unit, to whet
students’ appetites. The only problem I have encountered is the typical
depiction o f Caliban in the comic book—I have literally whited him out of
his monster-like role and have had students draw a more human version. I
have also photocopied the drawings of the various characters from the
comic book, enlarged them, cut them out and glued
them onto cardboard. Tape a chopstick to the back as a handle, and,
presto—you’ve got an instant puppet show!</p><p>
The setting of <i>The Tempest,</i> in my classroom at least, is definitely
Caribbean. Although I have never mounted a full-scale production, I have
invited other classes in for staged readings of one or two scenes. During
some sessions, Caliban has taught the Eu ropeans the traditional ball game
(a cross between soccer and volleyball), exposing them for the first time
to rubber. We have had Caribbean props for these presentations—root
vegetables, tropical fruits, sugar cane from the local Hispanic market,
salsa a nd merengue music and dance during the banquet scene (and prepared
Puerto Rican foods which would disappear, as in the play, but which we
would feast upon later), rain forest tapes of bird and animal sounds for
background noise, classroom lights flashing on and off for the opening
tempest/hurricane, mosquito nets and hammocks, Taino/Arawak petroglyphs on
the blackboard, and artifacts strewn on the floor—even cigars!</p><p>
At the recent suggestion of Professor Tom Whitaker at Yale, I have read
<i>A
Tempest</i> by Aimé Césaire, a contemporary writer from Martinique, and
recommend it highly for teachers interested in an alternate
interpretation. It is set in an African colony, and w ith the few
expletives deleted, it is certainly within the range of students after
they have been exposed to Shakespeare’s work.</p><p>
For a classroom twist (or as part of a production), Caliban can teach the
newcomers his language, thanks to the Taino/Arawak-Spanish-English
dictionaries that exist (theirs was not a written code, but we have
European documentation of their language writt en in our alphabet). The
following dictionary is my version—the illustrations are student
adaptations of woodcuts from the period.</p><p>
The possibilities, in other words, are endless. The bottom line is to have
fun while you—teacher and student—learn!</p>
