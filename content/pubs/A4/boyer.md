<h4>Background</h4>
<p>On December 7 and 8, 1981, I visited the Yale-New Haven Teachers 
Institute. This was, for me, a stimulating and rewarding experience and I 
wish to thank everyone who contributed so generously of their time and 
welcomed me so enthusiastically to the educational community in New Haven. 
I wish especially to thank Jim Vivian, Director of the project, for 
arranging a most productive visit and for maintaining just the right 
balance of detachment and support.</p>
<p>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute was created in 1978 as a 
joint project of Yale University and the New Haven public schools. The goal 
of the program is to use university resources to improve teaching and 
learning in the New Haven public schools. Through the Institute, middle and 
high school teachers work with Yale faculty to strengthen their academic 
backgrounds and develop new materials for the classroom. During the past 
three years, approximately one-third of the eligible middle and high school 
teachers in New Haven have participated as Fellows in the Institute. About 
one-half of these teachers have participated more than once. In addition, 
several dozen Yale faculty have been actively involved as consultants or 
instructors.</p>
<p>After an intensive two-day visit I'm pleased to present tentative 
impressions and suggestions, acknowledging that my own mental snapshots 
will necessarily overlook essential subtleties and leave key issues 
unaddressed.</p>

<h4>Strengths of the Program</h4>
<p>I must report--at the very outset--that the impact of the 
Yale-New Haven Institute far exceeded my expectations. My own past 
experience (including three years as director of the Santa Barbara 
Coordinated Education Project) has left me suspicious of such ventures. 
School-college collaboration frequently is either ceremonial with 
"showcase" luncheons or bureaucratic with endless planning sessions. Rarely 
does the program get to the heart of the matter--helping teachers and 
advancing the quality of education.</p>
<p>The Yale-New Haven teacher project is a dramatic exception to this 
rule. After talking with dozens of teachers and visiting classrooms I 
conclude that this project has fulfilled its stated goals. In this program, 
teachers are academically strengthened and classroom instruction is 
improved. Three characteristics have led to this success.</p>
<p><i>First, classroom teachers are involved</i>. The project has 
teacher-coordinators in each participating school who clearly are committed 
and who pass on their enthusiasm to colleagues. I felt this strongly during 
my visits to Jackie Robinson Middle School and James Hillhouse High School. 
At each school I was hosted by the Institute Coordinator who struck me as 
an exceptionally able person who had the respect of colleagues generated, 
in part I suspect, by the University connection.</p>
<p>In addition, these teacher-coordinators meet regularly as a group, 
serving as a kind of "shadow administration" for the project. One of the 
most impressive features of my visit was the after-school session I had 
with these Coordinators from the New Haven schools. Arriving after a 
fatiguing day, the teachers turned, with enthusiasm, to key issues. How can 
the Institute best help us meet our goals? How can we improve our work? 
With the battering ram of bad publicity constantly hammering away at 
schools, the dedication and optimism of these teachers was impressive, 
almost touching. While speaking of teacher participation I must underscore 
the point that the content of the summer project is shaped by teachers. 
It's the teachers who identify the topics to be studied and then the 
University builds seminars to integrative themes. The significance of 
teacher leadership cannot be overstated.</p>
<p><i>Second, Yale University is committed</i>. Typically collaborative 
programs of this sort--when they exist at all--are managed by Schools of 
Education. Several bureaucratic layers separate the project and the 
university's top administration. At Yale, no such bureaucracy exists. Yale 
has no School of Education and in this case that's a plus. Chief University 
administrators know about the program and give it full support. This 
University backing pays off in very tangible ways. Teachers in the program 
have access to full resources of the University. For the first time many of 
the classroom teachers feel at home on the campus. Time and time again, I 
heard the teachers speak of the excitement of being part of the Yale 
community and using Yale facilities--having access to the library, the 
opportunity to attend lectures--to be, in short, a respected member of an 
academic community.</p>
<p><i>Third, distinguished Yale faculty serve as mentors</i>. Frequently 
school-college projects are supported by "fringe" faculty or by those 
working on research who use the schools as a laboratory for their own 
advancement. It is truly remarkable that world-ranking faculty at Yale are 
committed to this program. One teacher said with genuine enthusiasm, "It's 
great to interact with the mental giants at Yale." Especially significant 
is the feeling the Yale faculty convey to teachers that they truly care. 
The faculty are viewed as colleagues and--not surprising--the respect is 
mutual. A Yale faculty member said that these are "most exciting teachers." 
In every interview, Institute participants spoke glowingly of the academic 
excellence of the program and they were committed to the program because 
they were studying <i>substance</i>, not methods courses. I heard stories 
of the special help teachers had given them, often beyond the call of duty. 
One teacher told of receiving a book from his Yale professor long after the 
Institute was over. Another told of a faculty member visiting her classroom 
to help teach a Shakespeare unit. I pressed to get some signal that the 
faculty "pulled rank" and looked down on the teachers. I left convinced 
that the relationship was authentic.</p>
<p>Equally impressive were Yale faculty comments about the teachers with 
whom they worked. They gained respect for the quality and dedication of the 
Fellows. One faculty put it directly. The teachers, he said, are "rather 
more heroic than one's colleagues."</p>
<p><i>Fourth, the program is well run</i>. Traditionally, collaborative 
programs fall between the slats. They are at once "everyone's business" and 
"no one's business." In time they fall apart. The Yale-New Haven Institute 
is well managed. Jim Vivian has guided the program with great skill, 
bridging the gap between the University and the community. He has convinced 
skeptics on both sides that the program has integrity and is worth their 
time.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Institute is an educational venture and when measured on 
this yardstick it has been a great success. However, I cannot avoid 
observing that the project is a political success as well. It's no secret 
that the University and New Haven are two separate worlds. The challenge is 
to find way for these worlds to meet. From my observation the Institute 
offers dramatic promise. It has put a human face on the University, opened 
doors, and focused resources where they are needed most. The University has 
gained enormously from the Institute and I conclude that for educational 
and community reasons the program should be nurtured and sustained.</p>
