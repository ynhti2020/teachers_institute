<h4>Background</h4>
<p>"The City in American Literature and Culture" was one of the 
interesting seminars offered in the 1981 Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. 
Fascinated by Professor Alan Trachtenberg's earlier Institute presentation 
of photographs on the American city by such noted pioneers as Lewis Fine 
and Walker Evans, I hoped the seminar to follow would allow me to combine 
the literary perspective on the American city with that of photography.</p>
<p>The seminar reading list, copious and demanding, gave a 
kaleidoscopic view of the American city. Three years of experience with the 
Institute had taught me that frugality and practicality were crucial in 
planning a unit. Some discussions of works, though helpful in gaining 
insights on the subject, for obvious pedagogical reasons could not be as 
successfully replicated in the high school classroom. The seminar reading 
list, therefore, divided into some things for reference and some things for 
teaching. Saul Bellow's <i>Seize the Day </i>and Henry Miller's <i>Black 
Spring</i> provoked some intriguing discussions, but were thoughtfully 
shelved; they were either too philosophical or too graphic for a public 
school audience. Tillie Olsen's <i>Tell Me A Riddle</i>, though an 
excellent novel for teenagers, was not a regular part of the school 
system's reading list. My unit consciously and conscientiously would 
contain works that were readily available in school book closets. Short 
works of Blake, Wordsworth, Whitman, and Sandburg appear in many 
anthologies. The works of Crane, Poe, Baldwin, Fitzgerald, and Eliot are 
similarly accessible.</p>
<p>Our seminar, structured around selected readings, was fruitful and 
provocative. The most helpful discussions were those directed by teachers 
on the problems and strategies of teaching literature to city students. One 
discussion emphasized the importance of "personalizing" the reading 
material. A work must relate to the students' own lives. In the university 
community, literature can be successfully taught as a thing-in-itself, as a 
representation of philosophical trends; to most public school students, 
this approach has doubtful value. Books must mean something immediate, or 
they are useless.</p>
<p>I tried earnestly to tie much of the reading and flavor of the seminar 
discussions into my final unit for the sake of enrichment, as well as 
economy. Teachers should always have the flexibility to delete or 
substitute works they deem appropriate, and I inserted more familiar works 
with which I had already experienced ample success. The seminar provided a 
framework on which to build.</p>
<p>The city conjures up a variety of images in the mind of even the most 
jaded observer. The artist, however, has a sharper vision of what the city 
represents. The images reflected in art, music, photography, and literature 
range from positive to negative, often lingering in blurred areas of 
neutral gray. The blaring sounds of radios carried by urban youths echo the 
vibrant spirit of a new musical age in contrast to the Blues, which still 
haunts storefront honky-tonks. Photographs of urban scenes reflect themes 
of alienation and brotherhood. Isolated characters with mute faces are 
foiled by casual scenes of lovers strolling through scented parks. The 
subway provides one of many poetic images of closeness and intimacy 
juxtaposed with snobbery and fear. In the words of Langston Hughes, blacks 
and whites, rich and poor, travel meshed together in a space where there is 
"no room for fear." Similarly, bold murals on the sides of buildings 
startle us with images of joy and hope amid pain and despair.</p>
<p>A study of artistic and literary images of the city revolts against any 
stereotyping of today's city as being all black or all white, all rich or 
all poor, all rock or all blues, island of isolation or "happening," all 
good or all bad. The purpose, then, of this unit of study is to direct 
students to compose an artistic and literary collage of contemporary urban 
life that seeks to <i>interpret, analyze</i>, and <i>evaluate </i>its 
mettle. Students are given an opportunity to integrate their impressions of 
urban life with established views, thereby enriching their understanding of 
their own present and future. The unit culminates in a student production 
of a room-size scrapbook depicting the full range of complexities in urban 
living.</p>

<a name="sect_2">
<h4>The Montage: A Tool for Interdisciplinary Studies</h4>
<p>The montage will take the form of a large display in an oversize 
classroom featuring student work on related topics. The display becomes a 
teaching tool for the class, providing a focal point for activities and 
lectures as well as an incentive for students to compete for space to show 
off their work. Students who are not academically talented are given an 
opportunity to show their artistic side. The use of the classroom project 
or the display is a technique usually dropped at the middle-school level. 
High school students show that they can still profit from this method. The 
unit on the city may also be adapted for middle-school students as well as 
for students in a small high school structured for interdisciplinary 
studies.</p>
<p>The montage is particularly suited for a study of the city. 
Students are prone to stereotype the city based on their own narrow 
experiences. New Haven students, particularly, view their own neighborhoods 
and others through the wrong end on the telescope. They see their city as 
fragmented, consisting of pocket "good" neighborhoods, where those rich 
people live, or "bad" neighborhoods, where those poor people lurk</p><p> a city 
split along jagged lines of ethnicity, class, and race. Closer analysis 
reveals that their perceptions are not wholly accurate. New Haven, like 
other American cities, is ever-changing; there is room for growth. As 
members of the future city, theirs is the responsibility to become more 
aware of the potential for greatness.</p>
<p>The montage can visually show the contrasts of city life. At the 
beginning of the course of study, teachers will announce that the class 
project will begin as soon as students begin to write, draw, and create 
various assignments for the marking period. Written reports will be typed 
or neatly rewritten and mounted on construction paper before being taped to 
one of the four walls of the classroom. Art work and graphs will be mounted 
and displayed as they arrive. The walls will slowly become a living 
scrapbook of the classroom's activities and will provide a constant 
incentive for expansion of major topics. Student work can be rearranged on 
a daily basis to make room for other work, or to highlight comparative and 
contrasting elements in poetry, prose, photography, and art.</p>
<p>The responsibility of teaching this unit should not be solely that of 
the English teacher, but should be shared with the social studies teacher 
who has a more solid background in teaching social theory. Art and 
photography teachers should be deployed to direct students in the artistic 
aspects of the montage. A tremendous amount of time is required for 
students to draw, mount, and construct the display.</p>

<h4>Social Theory on the Origins of the City</h4>
</a><p><a name="sect_3">"The origins of cities go back to the very dawn of 
civilization." The word, city, comes from the Latin "civitas," from which 
the word civilization also stems. In ancient Greek and Roman civilizations 
citizens were the property owners and the taxpayers. The first cities known 
to Western man began to appear in the river valleys of the Tigris and 
Euphrates in ancient Mesopotamia, the Nile in ancient Egypt, the Ganges in 
India, and the Yangtze in China. Mankind learned to live in established 
communities where the duties of food gathering and growing, hunting, and 
manufacturing tools and weapons were shared and structured to meet the 
needs of the entire community. These early communities became the first 
cities. Anthropologists trace the role of cities from places of social 
gathering for food distribution to fortresses to repel attacks, as in the 
case of Medieval cities of Europe. Later, the city became an industrial 
center, a focal point for the buying and selling and the shipping of goods. 
Farmers began to become increasingly dependent on industrialization for the 
production and distribution of produce.<sup></sup></a><a name="text_1"></a><a href="#note_1">1</a> In modern times industrialization 
made it possible for fewer farmers to produce enough food for larger 
portions of the population. In the United States, particularly, 
industrialization forced many small farmers out of business and compelled 
them to seek other jobs in the central city. To anthropologists, cities are 
a fact of life for man. Men did not consciously form cities; cities grew 
out of man's need for sharing food and other necessities as well as his 
need for communication and recreation. Cities were formed to serve those 
needs and, in turn, the cities molded men and women to serve their needs. 
Lewis Mumford in <i>The Culture of Cities</i> states, "Urban forms 
condition mind." Cities cause men and women to behave in various patterns, 
not always to their betterment. For this reason, people have long been 
suspicious of the city.<sup><a name="text_2"></a><a href="#note_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p>This suspicion of the city is well represented in the poem 
"Chicago" by Carl Sandburg. The poet describes the city as "wicked" and 
"brutal," full of "painted women under gas lamps luring the farm boys," 
"gun men who kill" and are "free to kill again," and hungry faces of women 
and children. Yet he defends the city. In spite of the negative aspects, 
the city is proud and brawling with strong men building a future, "flinging 
majestic curses amid the toil of piling job on job," a city laughing 
through the dust, "half naked, sweating/proud to be a Hog Butcher, Tool 
Maker, Stacker of Wheat, Player with/Railroads and Freight Handler to the 
Nation." The tension between the destructive and generative powers of the 
city in this poem reverberates throughout American literature.</p>

<a name="sect_4">
<h4>Images of the City in American Literature</h4>
</a><p><a name="sect_4">In "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," the American poet Walt Whitman 
joyously embraces the duplicities and complexities of city life. The images 
paraded before him from the ferry present a lusty challenge to the human 
spirit. He challenges all: "Flow-tide below me! I see you face to face!" 
Locomotion dominates the poem; everything moves. Images float, swim, flow 
with the ceaseless tide. Whitman's city does not sleep. The speaker 
identifies with the multitude. The spectacle of the fire from the foundry 
chimneys burning high and glaring into the night (abhorrent to Wordsworth 
and Blake) is witnessed as part of the fabric and vitality of the nation. 
"These and all else were to me the same as they are to you/I loved well 
those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river." The multitude of 
riddles and paradoxes of urban life perplex the reader also. "I too felt 
the curious abrupt questionings stir within me." But like others, the poet 
has no answers. The city is a fact of life to be experienced, tasted, and 
enjoyed. The nation is growing, must grow, and we with it: "Thrive, 
cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient 
rivers/Expand, bring that which none else is perhaps more spiritual." 
Whitman's city possesses a soul with a certain, yet unknown, destiny which 
must be recognized. "We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in 
you also/You furnish your parts toward eternity/Great or small, you furnish 
your parts toward the soul." "The implications [of many of Whitman's poems] 
are based upon a paradox: The larger mysteries of life remain unsolved, 
and it is in the realization of our profound ignorance that we approach 
truth and wisdom."<sup></sup></a><a name="text_3"></a><a href="#note_3">3</a></p>
<p><i>The Man of the Crowd</i> by Edgar Allan Poe, a contemporary of 
Whitman, hauntingly echoes the feeling that the city portrays realities 
that will remain a mystery. The quotation beneath the title warns us of the 
great evil of not being able to be alone in the city. The setting is 
London, that is, the London of Poe's imagination. Beginning as a casual 
observer of the "principal thoroughfares of the city," the speaker becomes 
gradually fixated on a dark figure "of a decrepit old man, "some sixty-five 
or seventy years of age "who evokes confused and paradoxical feelings of 
vast power, of caution, of penuriousness, of avarice, of coolness, of 
malice, of blood-thirstiness, of triumph, of merriment, of excessive 
terror, of intense--of extreme--despair." Compelled to follow him, the 
observer is led through the labyrinth of London's underworld. He is led to 
"the most noisome quarter of London, where everything wore the worst 
impress of the most deplorable poverty, and the most desperate crime." The 
old man is crime and poverty incarnate. He is the man of the crowd, a 
product of the city, an enigma. Perhaps there is some solace in not fully 
understanding existence. "Perhaps it is but one of the great mercies of God 
that `es lasst sich nicht lessen'"--it does not permit itself to be read. 
We are better off not knowing. Poe's image of this urban phenomenon is in 
sharp contrast to the openness with which Whitman embraces every aspect of 
urban living without question.</p>
<p>Stephen Crane's <i>The Bowery Tales</i> thrusts us into realism. The 
city becomes the suitable setting for this pervasive literary movement 
spirited by Zola and Dreiser. Crane is the American disciple. The Bowery 
provided Crane with his artistic education. The characters in <i>Maggie: A 
Girl of the Streets</i> and <i>George's Mother</i> are representative urban 
prototypes to be more carefully developed by James Farrell and Richard 
Wright decades later.<sup><a name="text_4"></a><a href="#note_4">4</a></sup> Rich with symbolism, Crane's tales combine irony 
with pity for the lowly, poverty stricken creatures who have little or no 
control over their lives. The snow that beats down on the heads of the 
wretches in <i>The Men in the Storm</i> represents those forces that shape 
men's lives. Whisky, poverty, and hunger plague George and his mother. The 
church, religion, offers little hope of salvation and is overpowered by the 
cold, hard city. "In a dark street the little church sat humbly between two 
towering apartment-houses." The church is bathed in the red lights of the 
street lamp. In the struggle between George and his mother, between the 
city and the church, the city will win. "The roar of wheels and the clangor 
of bells . . . interwoven into a sound emblematic of the life of the city," 
symbolically pierce the little church and all those who would believe in 
it.<sup><a name="text_5"></a><a href="#note_5">5</a></sup></p>
<p>The theme that man, as he continues to live in cities, becomes 
increasingly alienated from traditional forms of emotional support, 
explodes full force in the literature of the Lost Generation of the 1920s. 
The most important single poem of the decade was "The Waste Land" by T.S. 
Eliot, an American expatriot.<sup><a name="text_6"></a><a href="#note_6">6</a></sup> This theme appears again in F. Scott 
Fitzgerald's "Babylon Revisited" and continues into the next decade in 
Nathaniel West's <i>Miss Lonelyhearts</i>. The titles of these two works 
point directly to a loss of innocence or fall from God's grace. Charles 
Wales, the protagonist of Fitzgerald's work, repudiates the traditional 
ethics and morals America once held sacred, and surrenders to the 
extravagant, lavish, and reckless life of the new Babylon, Paris of the 
twenties. The false sense of security engendered by the business boom that 
quickly plunges the Western world into the Depression takes Charles as one 
of its casualties. Ironically, during the "boom" Charles loses everything: 
wife, child, all. The loss, however, has a sobering effect on Charles' 
character. Recovering from the depravities of alcohol and poverty, Charles 
regains much of his former state of rectitude.<sup><a name="text_7"></a><a href="#note_7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>The protagonist in <i>Miss Lonelyhearts</i> has a more dismal end. In an 
attempt to offer salvation to the crippling throng of humanity that writes 
him daily in the advice column of a big city newspaper, Miss Lonelyhearts 
becomes a self-anointed crucifixion figure who dies tragically at the hands 
of someone he tried so desperately to help. Seeing "that the majority of 
the letters are profoundly humble pleas for moral and spiritual advice, 
that they are inarticulate expressions of genuine suffering," Miss 
Lonelyhearts transposes himself into the ivory Jesus he has spiked to his 
wall. To him, the world has become "a world of door knobs." The grey sky 
"looked as if it had been rubbed with a soiled eraser. It held no angels, 
flaming crosses, olive-bearing doves, wheels within wheels. Only a 
newspaper struggled in the air like a kite with a broken spine." To West, 
the newspaper has replaced traditional modes of seeking solace and 
compassion. Weighed in the balances of human suffering, the newspaper is 
found wanting. Religion that once provided man with some sense of security 
has been replaced by a hollow media.</p>
<p>In <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i> James Baldwin further develops this 
theme of the conflict between religion and the city. The best known writer 
of the contemporary generation of city dwellers, Baldwin explores how the 
city-born child is affected by the problems his parents faced in the rural 
South. The scene in which John, the main character, stands in the middle of 
Central Park forms the center of the book itself. To John, the city offers 
new possibilities that his parents cannot fathom. "These glories were 
unimaginable--but the city was real." On top of the hill, his favorite 
spot, John's imagination dazzles with the lights that illuminate the 
skyline. The city is his for the taking. "He did not know why, but there 
rose in him an exultation and a sense of power, and he ran up the hill like 
an engine, or a madman, willing to throw himself headlong into the city 
that glowed before him." To John, "the people and the avenue underwent a 
change, and he feared them and knew that one day he could hate them if God 
did not change his heart." Like the fallen London woman in the movie, "Of 
Human Bondage," that he sees after the experience in the park, John 
foresees a time when he too would learn to tell the world, "You can kiss my 
ass." The city to John presents a multitude of paradoxes. John cherishes 
the possibility that a better life, a life of books and school where he had 
found some success, would open to him despite the gloomy web of poverty, 
ignorance and ugliness that surrounds him.</p>
<p>This struggle against lost dreams and the hypocrisy of city life also 
appears in the works of modern black writers such as Langston Hughes, 
Richard Wright, Lorraine Hansberry, and Gwendolyn Brooks and continues to 
dominate all aspects of contemporary American Literature.</p>

<h4>The City in Black and White / Color Photography</h4>
</a><p><a name="sect_5">The purpose of this section is not so much to give an historical 
account of the development of the use of the camera as an art form or as a 
documentary of American life; it is to justify the use of photography as a 
means of providing students another perspective in studying certain themes 
of man's relationship to the city. Once regarded by some artists as a 
threat, the invention of the camera has gradually opened new horizons, 
permitting man to reflect on himself and his relationship to his 
environment. As Moholy-Nagy, a noted pioneer in photography, points out: 
"Thanks to the photographer, humanity has acquired the power of perceiving 
its surroundings, and its very existence, with new eyes."<sup></sup></a><a name="text_8"></a><a href="#note_8">8</a></p>
<p>Contrary to what many people believe, the camera does not take 
pictures of reality or only what it sees. The resulting photograph must be 
interpreted just as any novel, poem, or story. Sandburg's poem, "Fog," 
describes a catlike form "on silent haunches" that moves elusively through 
the city and harbor. The poem suggests truths about the impersonality of 
urban life; however, it cannot be taken more literally than the viewing of 
a photograph that attempts to show the same scene.<sup><a name="text_9"></a><a href="#note_9">9</a></sup></p>
<p>Lewis Hine, an early photographer, clearly understood the power of the 
photograph in revealing certain realities about the city. Hine saw the 
value of social photography and exhibited countless photographs that 
exposed violations of child labor regulations and poor working conditions 
for immigrants in the 1900s. Fully aware that photographs could be faked, 
Hine, nevertheless, lectured that the photographs could serve as a metaphor 
for certain urban realities. Supported with other documentation, Hine had 
little trouble substantiating that child labor was abused in New England. 
His photograph, "Newsies, Brooklyn Bridge, 1908," a startling image of six 
newsboys frozen in expectation of making a sale one snowy morning, is a 
moving illustration of the power of the photograph.<sup><a name="text_10"></a><a href="#note_10">10</a></sup></p>
<p>Walker Evans' subway series entitled <i>Many Are Called</i> (1966), 
taken in the late 1930s and early 40s, and Robert Frank's "The Bus 
Photographs of New York City, 1958," illustrate the variety of 
interpretations in viewing single images framed by different photographers. 
The plight of mankind in the American city has been a major topic of many 
photographers even before Hine. Jacob Riis, a descendant of Dutch 
immigrants, dedicated much of his work "to provide believable, indeed, 
deliberately shocking pictures of the slums of the Lower East Side of New 
York and of their poverty-stricken inhabitants." "Baxter Street in Mulberry 
Bend, N.Y., 1888," "Street Arabs in Sleeping Quarters at Night, 1888," and 
"The Short Tail Gang under Pier at Fort Jackson Street," are carefully 
framed to show the stark, harsh realities of poverty, hunger, and 
despair.<sup><a name="text_11"></a><a href="#note_11">11</a></sup> In contrast, Max Yavno's photos of New York of the 1950s reveal 
a sense of humor and irony in the lives of the poor people of New York. 
"High Fashion," "Delancy Street," "West 14th Street," and "Canal Street" 
show a wider range of emotions for the city and its people.<sup><a name="text_12"></a><a href="#note_12">12</a></sup> The people in 
the Riis collection are defeated victims imprisoned by their environment, 
much like the characters in Crane's works; the people in the Yavno series 
are alive and functioning, despite the looming menace of towering stone 
buildings, gigantic artifacts of industrialization that dwarf their 
importance.</p>
<p>The traditions of the early pioneers of photography have been continued 
through the years by other noted photographers such as Helen Levitt, Robert 
Wilcox, Sally Stein, Alfred Stieglitz, John Szarkowski, and Jerome 
Liebling. An examination of a variety of photographs from these artists 
will enrich the discussion of urban life.</p>
<p align="RIGHT">[ <a href="#top">to the top of the chapter</a> ]</p>
<hr/>
<a name="sect_6">
<h4><p>Murals</p></h4>
</a><p><a name="sect_6">Black photographers such as James Vanderzee contributed to the 
development of photography as a chronicle of black life in the Harlem of 
the 1920s and 1930s.<sup></sup></a><a name="text_13"></a><a href="#note_13">13</a> A unique contribution of black artists in depicting 
urban life, however, has recently been the use of the mural. This 
particular genre of folk art began in the summer of 1967 when a group of 
black artists in Chicago created the "Wall of Respect," an outdoor wall 
covered with portraits of Black leaders and with the inscription: "This 
wall was created to honor our black heroes and to beautify our community." 
Four similar murals were painted in Boston. The purpose of the Boston 
murals was beyond beautification. Dana Chandler, one of the artists, wanted 
"his murals to awaken a feeling for the cultural heritage of the Negro 
race, to strike a chord of blackness." The muralists were seeking social 
purpose as well as aesthetic excellence. The mural of Roy Cato depicts in 
stark primary colors a black man and woman looking steadfastly into the 
sky. Beside them a human head expands in concentric circles, a graphic 
symbol of a growing black consciousness.<sup><a name="text_14"></a><a href="#note_14">14</a></sup></p>
<p>These murals bring art and a political message to empty lots. The 
exuberant murals of the Pocock collection of the New York Cityarts Workshop 
contrast with the reality of the urban ghetto. "These images are both 
pictures in themselves and documents of ephemeral gestures made in brick," 
surrealistic renderings of scenes that do not exist in the urban 
environment. In one mural a single lion majestically rests in the cool 
shade beneath an actual circus poster. In another an enchanted tree spreads 
out in a silhouetted corner. In yet another a fiery city skyline lies over 
haunted catacombs where ghostly figures stumble along tomblike cells. 
Jungle motifs, entangled in lush vegetation, amble above to mock the black 
asphalt below. Muscular forearms of sable drummers beat pulsating tomtoms, 
protesting the displacement of a tropical people. The mural depicting a 
white middle-class couple enjoying a sip of wine in a pleasant backyard 
setting sharply contrasts that of the ragged pair of youths--one black, one 
white--playing a cheerful game of basketball against a bright blue sky. 
Viewed together, these two murals reveal the range of experiences in city 
life of middle age versus youth, of wealth versus poverty, of white versus 
black, of camaraderie between racial groups versus group isolation.<sup><a name="text_15"></a><a href="#note_15">15</a></sup></p>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The lesson plans prepared for this unit reflect an interdisciplinary 
approach to learning. While the major emphasis of the above narration is 
literature, there is considerable room for further development in the area 
of social studies. The intent of this unit is to have the English teacher 
share his responsibilities for teaching the city through literature with 
other disciplines, mainly social studies, for historical perspective and to 
a supportive degree, art and photography, particularly but not exclusively 
for those students who are more easily motivated by the visual.</p>
<p>Photographs of urban life present single images suspended in time whose 
total significance cannot be grasped until studied by the viewer. The 
photographer's use of light and shadow, framing, and perspective serves to 
guide the attention of the observer. It is in the act of observation and 
study that the true power of the photograph is revealed.</p>
<p>As a result of my work in the "City" seminar, I was able to blend my own 
literary perspective and background on the American city with Professor 
Trachtenberg's visual analysis through photography of the urban 
environment. The combination of such different modes of artistic expression 
has produced a unit that directly addresses the needs of a varied urban 
student population.</p>
