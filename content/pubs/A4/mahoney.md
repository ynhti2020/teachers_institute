<h2 align="CENTER">Teaching a Science Seminar<br/>
in the Teachers Institute</h2>
<p align="CENTER"><big>by Maurice J. Mahoney, M.D.</big></p>
<p>Joining the efforts of the Teachers Institute was an easy 
decision. Even on reflection, after working in the Institute, my reasons 
seem sound and my expectations reasonable.</p>
<p>I was curious about high school teachers and about the teaching 
profession. I knew the public image of teaching was one of a profession in 
disarray. There is a lack of budgetary support from taxpayers. Newspaper 
and journal articles report teacher burn-out, declining scores of American 
youth on standardized tests, low aptitude scores of those entering teacher 
education programs in our colleges, and a flight of teachers, especially in 
math and science, from classroom to industry. Calls for new approaches to 
teacher certification or re-certification and new programs for continuing 
education (staff development) also abound. Perhaps the Teachers Institute 
would be one of the better vehicles to improve this situation, I 
thought.</p>
<p>There were other reasons. I knew I had a very personal stake in the 
quality of public education; I had several children partaking therefrom. I 
had already had my share of "lectureships" in elementary school rooms; the 
Institute provided me a new teaching experience, one that would let me know 
more about the high school student and classroom. I also believed in the 
efforts to increase service and participation of my university with the 
surrounding community to build town-gown ties.</p>
<p>There was one further reason that was explicit for me, a professional 
reason. I am a human biologist, a medical geneticist. I see daily the 
ignorance and prejudice of genetics knowledge extant in our populace. My 
colleagues and I have concluded that the education of the younger 
generation, starting in elementary school, will be the only practical means 
of overcoming this knowledge gap. I hoped the Institute might provide some 
help and experience in that direction.</p>
<p>In sum, there were several reasons to join the effort. I did so and have 
taught one seminar that examined human fetal development. There were some 
problems, but generally the seminar worked very well. I shall share both 
the factors that seemed to make it work well and those problems or barriers 
to success that I witnessed.</p>
<p>There is major strength in the format of the seminar. Both the 
time-frame, about four months, and the group size, ten to twelve persons, 
foster solid accomplishment. The seminar came together with Fellows who had 
chosen the general theme. I further found it useful to allow refinement of 
the seminar topic during the first one or two meetings. The Fellows 
required an overall structure for the seminar but their input to its 
definition helped cement their commitment and the ultimate utility of their 
written units.</p>
<p>The seminar setting and the presumption of collegiality encouraged 
dialogue and participation right from the outset. The Fellows brought their 
knowledge of the classroom and pedagogical techniques and the seminar 
leader his knowledge of the subject matter and of how to organize the 
information. Without anyone holding a monopoly of skills there developed a 
comfortable feeling of each person helping every other person, including 
the instructor.</p>
<p>The requirement of a work product and the nature of that product are 
central to the Institute's design. This requirement forced progress by 
stages throughout the classes that were scheduled. Despite the anxiety felt 
by some Fellows, the curriculum units provided the goal and sense of pride 
and accomplishment that characterized the seminar. The units had immediate 
value. They were ready for the coming year's classrooms, and they could be 
shared with fellow teachers. Each Fellow in the Institute was working very 
directly on his or her own professional requirements and teaching 
plans.</p>
<p>For the Fellows a major value of participation was the meeting of peers. 
Teachers learned to know each other well through working cooperatively on a 
joint product. They also became comfortable using one another's work and 
with the concept of borrowing and sharing within and between school 
buildings. Too often, apparently, the schoolroom teacher feels isolation in 
his or her own classroom.</p>
<p>In addition to the concept of each other being a resource, the seminar 
also demonstrated to each of the Fellows the usefulness of many community 
facilities. These included the libraries and museums of the University, 
access to research scientists and their laboratories, and the existence of 
local industries that shared particular areas of interest. These resources 
provided invaluable aid for the development of curriculum units, especially 
of laboratory exercises, and they will continue to be used by the 
teachers.</p>
<p>Problems in leading a seminar were also recognized. Some of these must 
be common to any seminar, but others are perhaps more acute for a seminar 
in one of the sciences. An example of the former was a wider disparity in 
the quality of curriculum units than I had expected; this resulted in some 
disjointedness in the overall product of the seminar. There were also 
different targets for the various units, and this detracted somewhat from a 
unified product. Some teachers taught mainly slow track students, others 
gifted students; some had captive, and thus too often bored, students; some 
taught in sixth and seventh grades and others in eleventh and twelfth. 
These differences provided the challenge to avoid too narrow a focus for 
any given unit; the challenge itself was worthwhile but not always 
successfully addressed.</p>
<p>The more difficult problems that I found while leading this seminar came 
because of the nature of science and because the subject matter was that of 
a very active science. The information gap between the Fellows and the 
seminar leader was great, and it was easy for him to appear as "too expert" 
and to overemphasize the role of lecturer. The Fellows would then be too 
much like students eager for facts that were entirely new to them. There is 
an information explosion in many of the sciences and teachers out of 
college a few years must be especially diligent to stay abreast of even one 
area. Many teachers are expected to teach more than one area of science 
today.</p>
<p>Resources are also difficult to supply to teachers in the currently 
active sciences. Textbooks are outdated and information is scattered in 
current journals. Experimental methods are restricted to modern, active 
research laboratories, and materials for classroom teaching too often 
remain two steps behind.</p>
<p>The development of useful laboratory demonstrations or exercises was 
only partially accomplished in our seminar and this provided considerable 
frustration. In a primary sense, science is characterized by experimental 
observation and inductive reasoning. These should be interwoven along with 
facts in science curricula so that students have experience with the 
scientific method, so important in a modern society. Laboratory exercises 
often are expensive, and monetary considerations cause further difficulties 
to curriculum design. Ingenuity and adequate time to develop experiments 
can surely improve this aspect of a science seminar, and explicit 
recognition of this need should be present from the outset.</p>
<p>The experience of teaching in the Institute brought many satisfactions 
to all of us in the seminar. Importantly, there were new friendships, new 
paths for trusting relationships to aid the teaching function, and pride in 
a cooperatively produced product. Better teaching world seem to be 
inevitable from the confluence of a better information base, shared and 
refined teaching techniques, increased confidence and motivation, and 
access to colleagues both at a university and within the school system.</p>
