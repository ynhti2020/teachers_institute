<h4>Background</h4>
<p>"Poetry and Paintings: A Comparative Study" is the result of 
my first experience with the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. In 
retrospect, and two units later, I continue to regard this initial 
experience as a particularly memorable and important one.</p>
<p>The process of the seminar, and the seminar leader in particular, 
enabled me to define roles I was grappling with as a second-year teacher. 
There is an intangible growing period all beginning teachers must 
experience; at this point we test and, presumably, come to understand our 
roles as teachers, students, writers, and creators. I believe many teachers 
would agree that the profession demands that we function as leaders while 
we continue to explore our fields. It also becomes apparent that learning 
to articulate creative impulses generates an enthusiasm that ultimately 
ignites even the most passive of classes. In short, all of the roles are 
essential, and all must be learned.</p>
<p>Professor Jules Prown and the experience of our seminar on "Art, 
Artifacts, and Material Culture" allowed me to think through and practice 
all of the aforementioned facets of the teaching experience. At times, the 
members of the seminar became students and were able to enjoy the expertise 
of a master teacher, Prown. At other times, the roles were reversed, as the 
seminar leader encouraged us to teach our units to the seminar. Although 
the units were diverse, and our interests varied, the content of the 
seminar served all of its members. I, for example, learned a method of 
seeing and/or reading paintings. This method is invaluable in the teaching 
of my unit, and has been passed on to my students.</p>
<p>In thinking back to this first experience as a Fellow of the Teachers 
institute, I particularly remember the development of a small idea into a 
viable teaching unit, emerging from conversations with Professor Prown and 
my colleagues; we regard Jules Prown as the consummate teacher. The 
intangible process of the dialogue, which was very much alive in this 
seminar, brought forth an excitement that continues to encourage us 
all.</p>
<p>Poetry is perhaps the most difficult of all literary forms to teach. 
Primarily due to a lack of exposure, children often view poetry as a 
precocious, trumped-up, and, therefore, ingenuine form of writing. The 
teacher becomes aware all too quickly that poetry is, in fact, an alien 
mode of expression for many. Her primary objective in teaching the genre, 
then, is to make poetry somehow accessible to her students.</p>
<p>Traditionally the vocabulary of poetry has been taught in a vacuum. That 
is, alien words are presented in a didactic manner which inevitably 
destroys the student's spontaneous emotional reaction or discovery that is 
prerequisite to enjoying and understanding poetry. The teacher faces a 
dilemma. She cannot overlook the vocabulary of poetry. An awareness of the 
devices which define the genre is essential. Yet individual "discoveries" 
of poetic devices, given a class size of twenty, is difficult. Teachers of 
large groups cannot consistently and effectively engage students in a 
dialogue of sharing and discovery when introducing something new. Often 
teachers have no idea from what framework the individual student is 
starting. In engaging this new or alien form of writing, poetry, the class 
needs a unifying experience, a common denominator which will invite 
reaction, discussion, and, finally, discovery.</p>
<p>It stands to reason that poetry, which is generally ignored by today's 
visual and auditory oriented society, could be more easily approached, 
understood, and judged if it were introduced through a natural coupling 
with a visual or auditory mode of expression. Teachers often introduce 
poetry through popular song lyrics. This provides students with a familiar 
framework that facilitates an introduction to the genre of poetry.</p>
<p>This unit proposes that a visual mode of expression can also be employed 
effectively when approaching poetry. Poems and paintings lend themselves 
quite naturally to comparative study, for the artist in both cases "sees" 
the world; observation of detail, and the enjoyment of the meaning of 
detail, are inherent characteristics of the process of poet and artist 
alike.</p>
<p>Paintings, a familiar mode of expression, allow students an emotional 
reaction, where poetry often does not. Classroom experience indicates that 
individual responses to paintings are readily forthcoming and real; they 
are fresh, honest, and natural. This, then, is where the learning process 
can begin.</p>
<p>Once a student has reacted emotionally to a painting, the next level of 
understanding may be approached; the why or how of the artist. It is at 
this point that vocabulary, which is comparable to that used for poetry, is 
introduced. To put it simply, the teacher begins with paintings, and 
transfers the beginnings of understanding of this familiar mode of 
expression to the alien expression, poetry.</p>
<p>This unit is created with a ninth-grade advanced English class in mind; 
it was in such a class that initial experiments were conducted, and met 
with some success. Presumably this method could be modified for use with 
other levels and grades.</p>
<p>A comparative vocabulary for poetry and paintings has been developed. 
Topics for lesson plans for the concurrent study of paintings and poetry 
deal with such terms as; mood, metaphor and symbol, pattern. Terms are 
introduced through the visual mode of expression, and then transferred to 
the written. Student understanding of each idea should be such that, as a 
final step, the student becomes artist-poet. That is, students can use 
these devices for the creation of their own forms of expression, visual and 
written. These art forms are the result of their intellectual and emotional 
involvement with ideas and discoveries associated with paintings and 
poetry.</p>

<h4>Mood</h4>
<p>The beginnings of my ideas for a curriculum unit comparing 
poetry and paintings occurred with preliminary classroom discussions 
focused on mood. Together, my students and I considered the impact of color 
and form as regards emotional reaction to visual experience. We learned to 
articulate the process through which the artist is able to convey feeling, 
and, later, were able to see a similar process at work in poetry. Much of 
this section of the unit is geared to individual reaction and discovery as 
the summary of my lesson plans to follow indicates.</p>
<p>Initially, students were asked to list words which projected 
various feelings and to label colors as indicating of specific moods. This 
exercise served to introduce the analytical stance we would have to assume 
later in the unit. Students were then shown paintings and asked to 
articulate their emotional responses. Invariably the question of color and 
form emerged. When poetry was introduced, students were able to see a 
similar process at work, and noted the impact of imagery and metaphor. 
Early on, a "hands on" project was assigned. Students were asked to depict 
a mood both visually and in writing. This creative and imitative process 
served to generate excitement, and led to a more provocative understanding 
of the idea of mood.</p>
<p>At this point, students were interested in considering one color, blue. 
We were able to discuss various connotations associated with the color blue 
which led quite naturally to analysis of paintings from Picasso's blue 
period as well as to discussions of "The Blues" music. Once again, students 
were asked to create and written projects; they easily wrote poetry and 
sketched drawings entitled "The Blues." Students appeared to have accepted 
the rhythm of the unit, and we were ready to take the next step.</p>

<h4>Metaphor and Symbol</h4>
<p>While considering the presentation of the study of metaphor and 
symbol in poetry and paintings, I soon realized that some distinction would 
have to be made between what is meant by metaphor and what constitutes a 
symbol. In my mind, metaphor denotes an <i>ongoing </i>comparison between 
two unlike objects which have at least one characteristic in common. One 
object defines a quality of the other. Symbol, on the other hand, is that 
which <i>stands for</i> an emotion, thought, or even a philosophy. In a 
sense, metaphors become symbols, and yet they are not always symbols. 
Symbols are usually generated from metaphors, but the original meaning of 
the metaphor may be lost as the symbol begins to speak only for itself in 
the mind of readers or observers. I have endeavored to portray the process 
of this transition specifically in Tennyson's poem, "The Eagle," as 
compared with the American eagle as a visual symbol of the United 
States.</p>
<p>The next stumbling block I encountered was getting over the idea 
that symbols are more associated with paintings while metaphors are 
reserved for poetry. One quickly admits that poetry makes great use of 
symbols through allusions which make metaphors come alive in many 
instances. But how do metaphors work in art? The answer was to be found in 
E.H. Gombrich's discussion in <i>Art and Illusion</i> of Picasso's "Baboon 
and Young." Picasso created a bronze statute from a toy car; he was able to 
see a baboon's face in this toy car, and created a metaphor, or a new way 
of seeing the baboon, the car, and the world around us. A formal 
delineation of the difference between metaphor and symbol is not included 
in the lessons which follow. Instead, differences are implied through a 
study of the process of transition and/or the way metaphor and symbol work 
together.</p>
<p>Teaching this aspect of the unit is somewhat different from the previous 
one on "mood" in terms of strategy. Vocabulary is introduced earlier. The 
method remains intact, however, as symbol is quickly related to visual 
images for purposes of understanding. Students become artist-poets earlier, 
rather than as a culmination; active participation is an effective way to 
engage students in striving to grasp this very important and rather 
complicated concept. The following provides a brief summary of lessons and 
activities for this section.</p>
<p>Students are initially introduced to the concept of symbol through 
simple, readily understandable, or familiar examples. Psychological, 
religious, and philosophical symbols are introduced. The Star of David, for 
example, is analyzed. Students are asked to think of symbols as well as to 
devise symbols or metaphors of their own. Two paintings, rich in symbolism, 
are then presented. Students, having already formulated a basic 
understanding of the term, symbol, are led through an informal analysis of 
each painting that leads to discovery of symbolism as it relates to theme. 
They are then ready to note symbols and metaphors in poetry. A poem is 
introduced along with a brief exploration of the terms simile and metaphor. 
Students are asked to comment on the mood and theme of the work informally, 
through questions. They are also expected to see symbols as they are often, 
in this particular work, related through comparisons or metaphors. An 
additional comparison of poetry and painting follows which emphasizes the 
transitions of metaphors and symbols. Finally, writing and artistic 
"exercises" are included which endeavor to enhance comprehension of these 
concepts and how they work, as well as to trigger creative impulses in 
students. These exercises need not come at the end of this section of the 
unit, but might be introduced at various points, depending on class 
needs.</p>
<p>A sample lesson plan is included here to provide the reader with a 
closer view of the strategy described above. As mentioned, I have chosen 
the comparison of Tennyson's poem, "The Eagle," with a painting of the 
American eagle. Together these works project the transitions of metaphors 
and symbols.</p>
<center><table>

</td>

</tbody></table></center>
<p>Students are initially given an untitled version of the poem. They 
are expected to read closely to unravel clues and comprehend the metaphor 
"crooked hands" and simile, "like a thunderbolt." They are then shown a 
painting of an eagle, and are encouraged to ascertain why the eagle was 
chosen as a symbol of the United States. They are asked to note metaphors 
which can be found within the symbol itself. This enables students to see 
qualities of the eagle which are comparable to qualities which the nation 
hopes to have. The discussion covers, for example, the strength of a nation 
as compared to the strength of an eagle's wings, the sharp eyes to a 
country with vision, and the largeness of the bird as compared with the 
largeness of the country, both physically and influentially. Students are 
then asked to return to the poem. They are encouraged to articulate 
Tennyson's vision of the eagle, as well as answer the question; how did 
Tennyson "paint his picture" of the eagle?</p>

<h4>Pattern</h4>
<p>The term, pattern, encompasses both structure and rhythm. The 
structure or symmetry of a tree produces a pattern; the rhythm of waves, 
too, is pattern. It is pattern that enables us to comprehend the world 
outside of ourselves. Visual symmetry and rhythmic scheme make us feel 
comfortable and in control. Pattern, in a sense, dominates our world.</p>
<p>This discussion of pattern in poetry and paintings is incomplete 
because I have been unable to capture all of the nuances of comparing 
structure and rhythm. In a sense, pattern cannot be tied down. Even in its 
repetitions of old themes, it always emerges in a different way; it is 
invariably connected with other components in each artistic expression, be 
it poetry or painting. Thus, Robert P. Tristam Coffin's use of the couplet 
scheme in "The Secret Heart" denotes completion, wholeness, and peace, 
qualities which are encompassed in the theme of the poem. W. H. Davies' use 
of the couplet scheme in "Leisure," on the other hand, denotes, in its 
repetitive quality, a sense of time passing; this is the central issue of 
that poem's theme. Just as rhythms and structures of nature never cease to 
be different given a different frame of reference, so, too, pattern in 
poetry and paintings is subject to the intention of the poet and artist, 
and, thereby, projects different meanings.</p>
<p>The following ideas for lesson plans can be divided into three parts. 
The first part seeks to define in terms of the natural patterning of the 
world as we know it, or as we like to know it. At this point, balance, 
symmetry, and visual and auditory patterns are discussed. Students 
initially are asked to comment on a symmetrical and an asymmetrical shape. 
The response is expected to be on an emotional level. They are asked to 
consider the reason behind their responses. One shape denotes completion, 
stability; the other, incompleteness, instability. This leads to a 
discussion on patterns in nature.</p>
<p>Following a reading of poetry and prose in a foreign language, students 
are expected to connect the poet's artistic rhythms with the auditory 
rhythms of the ideal world around him. The first part of this section 
concludes with a comparison of two radically different views of the world 
in paintings. One painting is natural, symmetrical, somehow ordered. The 
other is chaotic, unstructured, and represents disorder. Students are asked 
to comment upon the meanings of each work as well as to express emotional 
reactions.</p>
<p>The second part of this section deals with shapes as part of structure 
in paintings and with comparable rhythmic schemes in poetry. Specific 
paintings and poems are compared with the intention of showing how shapes 
and rhythmic schema affect not only the mood but the meanings of each work. 
The first comparison is of the oval or circle motif in Renoir's "Madame 
Renoir" and the couplet verse of Coffin's "The Secret Heart." Both devices 
denote a sense of completeness or oneness which correlates directly with 
the underlying intention of each artist. Students are asked to discover 
this correlation through a series of discussion questions.</p>
<p>The second comparison is of Winslow Homer's "The Morning Bell" and 
Burgess' "Sestina of Youth and Age." Both works of art depict conflict. 
Once again shape, the triangle, and rhythmic schema, through their own 
innate characteristics, reveal meaning, complexity or conflict in this 
case, and help to define the mood and message of the artist. Again, 
students are expected to "discover" the comparison through questions.</p>
<p>The third part of the section on pattern harks back to the previous 
section on metaphor and symbol. Students learn that the structure of a 
painting may, in and of itself, express symbolically the meaning of the 
work. Concrete poetry is introduced as it, too, visually presents a symbol. 
Students are asked to consider whether or not the rhythm of the poem is 
somehow connected to its of symbol.</p>
<p>Finally, the section concludes with a return to ideas for student art 
and writing. As was the case in the second section, teachers are advised to 
use these exercises when they are deemed appropriate within the section as 
a whole.</p>

<h4>Retrospection</h4>
<p>"Poetry and Paintings: A Comparative Study" has been used with 
many classes at this writing. Students, for the most part, have responded 
more positively than might have been expected to this interdisciplinary 
approach to learning. I discovered that students became involved in an 
appreciation of visual art, and appeared to be "ripe" for such an 
experience. The method then is valuable in two ways. First, students who 
are primarily visually oriented are able to transfer knowledge of a visual 
mode of expression to the written; second, students can be encouraged to 
view visual expressions or art analytically.</p>
<p>The present curriculum unit led quite naturally to a sequel, "Past 
and Present New York Through a Comparative Study of Photography and 
Poetry." This second unit combines the study of history, poetry, and 
photography. Students are able to see the reflections of various moods and 
changes of an important city in the works of poets and photographers. They 
are also encouraged to consider differences between painting and 
photography through a study of photography.</p>
<p>I now firmly believe that the broad-based humanities approach to 
learning provides students with a more sophisticated and cohesive 
understanding of all art forms, and is notable for the enthusiasm that it 
generates. This teacher was ultimately rewarded with student creative 
writing that reflected intellectual and emotional involvement with the 
study of poetry, paintings, and photography.</p>
