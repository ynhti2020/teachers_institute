<p>The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is an educational partnership between Yale University and the New Haven Public Schools designed to strengthen teaching and learning in local schools and, by example, in schools across the country. Through the Insti
tute, teachers from the University and the Schools work together in a collegial relationship. Founded in 1978, the Institute is the first program of its type to be established permanently as a unit of a university.</p>
