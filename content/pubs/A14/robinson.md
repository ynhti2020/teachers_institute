<h2>An Editorial Statement</h2>
<p><font size="+1">By Jay L. Robinson</font>
</p></center>
<hr/>
In 1886, John Dewey, with others who were to become his colleagues,
founded the Michigan Schoolmasters' Club at the University of Michigan.
The place isn't important, but likely the persons were. Dewey was only one
of the founders and never became more than the Club's Vice-President,
which he was in 1887 and 1888. Dewey spoke at the first regular meeting of
the Club on May 1, 1886: his topic was "Psychology in High School from the
Standpoint of College."
<p>
What he said we do not know in detail, save that it had to do with whether
or not psychology should be taught in high schools. But what he said
likely had influence (or perhaps his listeners did) for The Schoolmasters'
Club, as a cooperative endeavor, lasted many years. Joseph Ratner, a
would-be biographer of Dewey, said of the Club:
</p><p>
"Unlike other existing teachers' associations, the newly formed Club
brought together for discussion of their common professional problems two
classes of teachers that were universally regarded to be, if not two
different breeds, at least two separate and distinct kinds. The radical
nature of the Club's membership can be fully appreciated only when one
realizes that, according to the best information available, it is, sixty
years later, still alone in the field."
</p><p>
Ratner hints at one reason why the Club endured:
</p><p>
"...apparently, even teachers find it much easier to talk about democracy
than to practice it. And it requires an imperious democratic sentiment
voluntarily to give up the enjoyment of caste distinction. To think of
themselves as on the same level as 'schoolmasters' and 'schoolma'ams' is
more than the majority of college professors can stand."
</p><p>
Ratner's perspective is obviously that of a university teacher, and his
language is antique. Yet "class," maybe even "caste," distinctions still
separate university from school teachers. Daily routines are there to make
differences and make them real: the ways each kind of teacher gets and
holds a job, and then does it in a way to benefit students. And of course
the daily pressures on each kind or class or caste of teacher differ:
those that come from students, those that come from colleagues and
administrators, those that come from interested constituencies, and those
that come from agencies that would hold each kind or class or caste of
teacher accountable. Ratner had his own notion about why The Michigan
Schoolmasters' Club endured in spite of all of that:
</p><p>
"...immeasurably...important in the Club's rapid development...were the
ideas it stood for and promoted. It was a living embodiment of the idea
that the college is an integral part of the educational system and not a
precious ornament decorously poised on its head. And by papers and
discussions, the Club gave direction and momentum to the idea that the
problems of college edcation and secondary education cannot be solved
independently of each other but must be solved together."<font size="1"><b>1</b><font>
</font></font></p><p><font size="1"><font>
In 1993, many more "clubs" than Dewey's exist: many that join university
and secondary school teachers together, many that invite elementary school
teachers as well into collaborative work. And many new collaborations
continue to form, to take on new shapes, and even, in some cases, to
endure. Yet even with these, those that do endure, so do the problems: how
to work effectively together to work past distinctions of kind, class,
maybe even caste; how to work past the differing obligations the different
challenges that even those who wish to work together must ultimately face;
how to find a common language that is resistant to distinctions of kind
and enabling of mutual understanding and cooperative work. The publication
we now announce the publication we will ask you to read and write for is
intended to provide a forum in which a common language may be found, in
which important questions can be raised, in which meaningful answers, no
matter how tentative, be proposed.
</font></font></p><p><font size="1"><font>
<i>On Common Ground</i> will be a periodical publication of the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute and will focus upon the development of teachers
and their curricula through university-school collaboration. But the
publication will not be parochial. Its Editorial Board, a mixed group of
people concerned with schools and schooling, knows that a notion like
"curriculum" is a contested one a place for inquiry and for talk, a topic
about which talk can become very contentious since no talk about
curriculum can ever be anything other than value-laden. Its members know
too how much is both revealed­and hidden­in a phrase like "the
development of teachers." Which teachers, when university and school
teachers work together? Both, or school teachers only? What questions of
kind or class or caste will arise? What kinds of questions allow for
mutual inquiry into common problems when one prepares to meet the dizzying
complexity and diversity in America's schools and universities as they now
exist? <i>On Common Ground</i> means to invite questions of just this kind
for they seem, now, to be the most urgent ones. As an Editorial Board, we
struggle with these questions, even as we struggle to find a language that
will unite us, yet allow us to speak of our diverse interests and
obligations.
</font></font></p><p><font size="1"><font>
As an Editorial Board, we see issues of substance, content, language, as
the important ones. But we consider the mechanisms of collaboration
important as well. How do we find means to encourage and support new
collaborative arrangements among teachers in college and teachers in pre
collegiate education? The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has done that
through conferences and through other publications. Others too have tried,
sometimes successfully, sometimes with not much success. The notion of
collaboration, very popular now, does not always mean cooperation:
colleagues working together toward a common sense of who they are as
professionals; colleagues searching for ways to seize on and make common
the notion that "the problems of college education and secondary education
cannot be solved independently of each other but must be solved together."
The ideal of cooperation is hard won, no matter how earnestly people mean
to collaborate. We mean this publication to be practical, even as it aims
at the ideal.
</font></font></p><p><font size="1"><font>
So many problems are out there and other kinds of partnerships than those
among teachers must be considered. Partnerships with students, for
example, speaking to and with others both inside and outside the
classroom. One member of the Editorial Board remembers a poem a student
wrote in a class involving school and university teachers working together
to invite students to raise their own voices to speak about issues that
deeply concern them. The poem, read in a certain way, invites others into
the conversation­new partners who might have means teachers lack to
act as participants in helping this student and others understand problems
of the kind she writes about, and then do something about them.
</font></font></p><p><font size="1"><font>
The student's topic is unemployment; she titles her poem: 
</font></font></p><h3><font size="1"><font>MISFORTUNE</font></font></h3><font size="1"><font>
In his abandoned room,
<br/>a man lies shivering,
<br/>forgotten in the silence,
<br/>of a nation otherwise preoccupied.
<p>
After two decades
<br/>at Dawson Tool and Die.
<br/>he reads his name 
<br/>on the layoff list.
</p><p>
Canvassing the one-industry 
<br/>town, he finds only empty words.
<br/>"Sorry pal, I'd like to help,
<br/>but you know how the
<br/>recession is."
</p><p>
Near the broken window,
<br/>a sieve for a February wind,
<br/>a man lies rigid,
<br/>shrouded in a silence,
<br/>where even nature's elements
refuse compassion.
</p><p>
The adolescent author of this poem <font size="-1"><b>2 </b></font> lives
in an inner-city, and is growing up in a community in which she doesn't
have to be taught the facts of unemployment. Her good teachers, thinking
of her future, invited her to imagine what it feels like to be unemployed,
what the world feels like to those who are unemployed. When she does, as
she does in this poem, she has something important to say both to her
teachers and to other would-be school partners who might think about
unemployment in other terms­the terms employers customarily use. The
facts of unemployment are important, but so too are the feelings.
</p><p>
We mean to invite employers into conversations with teachers and with
students to encourage partnerships that reach beyond classrooms. But we
mean to do so in a way that does not ignore or silence the voices of
students or the voices of teachers when the conversation is about serious
issues like unemployment. Good teachers want to teach skills that will
make their students employable, and to do that, they need to know what
skills are demanded. But good teachers want more than that: opportunity
and time to ask a student to write a poem, ponder her past, wonder about a
future, and ask for herself what skills she both needs and wants. We mean
to ask together what we can do as partners, in partnerships, acting in
collaboration, to use what we learn to solve problems that trouble us
all­not just one young woman trying imagine what it would be like to
be unemployed should she become so.
</p><p>
We mean to do no less and perhaps more, and perhaps we should explain why
we want to. We think we must do no less because the collaborative
movement, if it is to be effective, must be about change: change in the
ways schools and universities do what they do; change in the ways those of
us who care about schools and schooling express our caring. <i>On Common
Ground</i> will be about change and about how people can work together to
effect change­work together to help children, young adults, teachers
too, to imagine better lives for themselves, maybe even find better lives.
We are all of us in that together, and somehow, we must find common
ground.
</p><p>
But in our country, it's not always easy to find common ground. In our
country, for reason of our complicated but interesting history, few forums
exist for discussion of common problems­the difficult and important
kinds of problems that affect large numbers of people of very different
backgrounds and interests. In our country, few institutions exist that
are, and must be, sensitive, sometimes very quickly, to voices asking for
change­a multiplicity of voices asking for change, often demanding
it.
</p><p>
The place called "school" is one such forum. But schools, especially
public ones, are not, as they are so often imagined to be, efficiently
functioning organizations with clear consensual goals which can easily be
rationalized, easily changed. Schools, especially public ones, must make
room for the social, economic, ethnic, and linguistic diversity that
exists in twentieth-century America: a diversity of patterns of living and
of believing that makes consensus difficult if not impossible. Schools, in
our time, are complex cultures in which the inhabitants (those who learn
and teach), and interested parties (parents, caretakers, policy-makers,
commentators and educational researchers), have sometimes common, more
often conflicting, even sometimes directly contradictory interests,
motivations, and goals. And schools, right now, are dangerously vulnerable
to those who would only mandate, to organized groups who would deny
diversity and silence multiple voices and multiform oints of view. To
think about schools and schooling­even curriculum­in this way,
is to be sensitive to the complexities of human intentions: to those of
teachers, those of administrators, those of students, those of union
leaders, those of educational researchers, those of policy makers, those
who would mandate, those of the various complicated constituencies who
live outside schools but who inevitably shape the beliefs and actions of
those whose lives­short and long­are lived inside them.
</p><p>
In this way of thinking, any thought about collaboration­any impulse
toward cooperation­becomes thought about roles and relationships, and
urgent questions get raised: For those who would collaborate in making a
school, what role should and can be played­expert? policy maker?
social engineer? pundit? partner? For those who choose to act a role, what
relations should be enacted with others who choose to make a school? Once
a role is chosen, what relations can be enacted with others? If partner is
the role, what relations need to follow?
</p><p>
<i>On Common Ground</i> invites inquiry into such questions. Its ground,
difficult enough to map, is what has and can be made of school-university
collaborative efforts focused upon the (reciprocal) development of
teachers and their curricula. But other territory is there to be explored
and understood, as this editorial has implied. Curricula have often been
imagined as means to make both "schools" and "schooling." But good
teachers know, and learn anew every day, that schools and schooling are
much more than curricula, which can easily be mandated but less-easily
enacted unless teachers act out roles that establish collaborative and
cooperative relationships with the students they teach. For good teachers,
schooling gets enacted and learning takes shape in the complicated
interchanges that happen every day in classrooms among teachers and
students working together to form a community of learners. And good
teachers know that community is not easily formed in a society that is and
should be multi-cultured.
</p><p>
Commenting on the kind of education our times demand, Maxine Greene, the
educational philosopher, argues for a kind of knowing "that surpasses and
transforms, that makes a difference in reality." For her, that kind of
knowing demands fresh thought about subject matter, about curriculum.
Curriculum is important, she argues, but "Students must be enabled, at
whatever stages they find themselves to be, to encounter curriculum as
possibility. By that I mean curriculum ought to provide a series of
occasions for individuals to articulate the themes of their existence and
to reflect on those themes until they know themselves to be in the world
and can name what has been up to then obscure."<font size="-1">
<b>3</b></font> Curriculum as in part an occasion for a student to write a
poem about unemployment and to reflect on its human meanings and costs.
</p><p>
But to make such an occasion come alive, to make curricula that will serve
active learning, requires a pedagogy that is sensitive to the needs of
individual learners in all their splendid diversity.
</p><p>
"...today, given the cataclysmic changes that have taken place in the
advanced technological society, we must recognize that more is demanded
than an alteration of objective relationships to the means of production
or to the machine. Human subjects have to be attended to; human
consciousness must be taken into account, if domination is to be in any
way reduced. This is one reason for the central importance of pedagogy in
these days: once pedagogy becomes crucial, the splits and deformations in
those who teach or treat or administer or organize take on a political
significance never confronted in time past."<font size="-1"><b>4</b></font>
</p><p>
As we seek to find common ground to stand on in order to change education
in productive ways, we must not allow curriculum to be separated from
pedagogy. To do so is perhaps to invite a separation of university from
school teachers; certainly it is to leave in place the gulf that separates
liberal arts colleges from schools of education and to discourage
partnerships that can be made productive. The communities we form through
collaboration must be inclusive ones.
</p><p>
Robert Westbrook connectsJohn Dewey's commitment to education­to the
place called "school," to the ideal of cooperation­to Dewey's
lifelong commitment to the ideals of a democratic society. He writes this
about Dewey's notion of what such a society owes a child to enable her to
join a democratic society and help sustain it:
</p><p>
"All members of a democratic society, he declared, were entitled to an
education that would enable them to make the best of themselves as active
participants in the life of their community: '...To extend the range and
the fullness of sharing in the intellectual and spiritual resources of the
community is the very meaning of the community.'
</p><p>
"For a child to become an effective member of a democratic community,
Dewey argued, he must have 'training in science, in art, in history;
command of the fundamental methods of inquiry and the fundamental tools of
intercourse and communication,' as well as 'a trained and sound body,
skillful eye and hand; habits of industry, perseverance, and, above all,
habits of serviceableness.' In a democratic community children had to
learn to be leaders as well as followers, possessed of 'power of self
direction and power of directing others, powers of administration, ability
to assume positions of responsibility' as citizens and workers. Because
the world was a rapidly changing one, a child could not, moreover, be
educated for any 'fixed station in life,' but schools had to provide him
with training that would 'give him such possession of himself that he may
take charge of himself; may not only adapt himself to the changes which
are going on, but have power to shape and direct those changes.'"<font size="1"><b>5</b></font>
</p><p>
Dewey calls for the development of sound academic curricula and for the
reciprocal development of teachers as they work together to make
curricula. But Dewey's challenge to education goes beyond that, for he
calls on students­with help from adults­to develop skills,
habits, and powers that can only be developed in community with others
acting as partners. For Dewey, the stakes were nothing less than the
continuing renewal of a democratic society­the nurturing and
maintenance of a full and participatory liberty that recognizes difference
but provides for all some common ground as individuals act for and with
others. Perhaps through collaboration, perhaps through partnerships, we
can model the democratic multi-cultured society we should have.
