<h2>Involved and Empowered Teachers Are the Keys to Education Reform</h2>
<font size="+1"> By Terry Knecht Dozier</font>
</center>
<hr/>
Since his appointment as Secretary of Education, Richard W. Riley has
demonstrated his commitment to establishing a vital link to the classroom
teachers of America. Again and again, he has spoken of his belief that
teachers are an essential part of the solution to revitalizing education
in this country, and not, as has often been suggested in the past "part of
the problem." That is why the Secretary appointed me, a twenty year
veteran of the classroom, to be his special adviser for teaching. In the
Secretary's view, it is critical to have a teacher's perspective at the
federal level to serve as a "reality check" on the Department's policies,
programs, and legislation.
<p>
It only makes sense, one might say, to have a classroom teacher in on
policy discussions affecting education, but my appointment is a first.
Through my position, I intend to bring the experience and needs of
classroom teachers nationwide to the attention of policymakers in
Washington.
</p><p>
Over the past eight months, I have been designing strategies to ensure
that the voice of teachers is heard as we develop education policy here.
To take advantage of the expertise of the many teachers who visit the
nation's capital­many of whom are here to receive prestigious
awards­I have begun a series of focused discussion groups between
these teachers and department officials. In our focus groups, more
opportunities for ongoing professional development has been one of the
teachers' primary concerns. Teachers need more time for individual and
group study, planning, involvement in professional networks, and better
access to information and new technologies. As a result, many of the ideas
and suggestions teachers communicated to department officials in our
meetings were used in the crafting of the professional development section
(Title II) of the Improving America's Schools Act, the Clinton
administration's proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act, which is the federal government's largest ($10 billion-a
year) investment in education.
</p><p>
In addition to the focus groups, one of the most exciting and promising
initiatives I have been involved with is the Goals 2000 Teacher Forum. On
November 18-l9, in conjunctionwith American Education Week, and as part of
our continuing effort to connect directly with classroom teachers, the
Department has sponsored the first annual Goals 2000 Teachers Forum to be
held in Washington, D.C. We will gather more than 100 teachers, including
many of the current State Teachers of the Year and other outstanding
public and private school educators, to hear their thoughts on education
issues and policies. In particular we want to explore the ways in which
the federal government can collaborate with teachers to achieve the
National Education Goals, an essential component of the Goals 2000:
Educate America Act.
</p><h3>South Carolina Teacher Forum</h3>
I know first-hand the power and potential of teacher forums. In my state
of South Carolina, we have a very active state forum that was modeled
after the National Teachers' Forum sponsored in 1986 by the Education
Commission of the States. Along with Dr. Jim Rex, at that time Dean of the
School of Education at Winthrop College, I was very involved in
establishing this state forum. Through the statewide network of South
Carolina's most outstanding teachers, the South Carolina Teacher Forum
continues to provide a mechanism for these teachers to influence the
state's educational systems through increased interaction with
policymakers, business leaders, and most importantly, other teachers. In
addition, active local and regional forums have grown out of this
successful state model.
<p>
Now in its seventh year, the South Carolina Teacher Forum has produced
impressive results. Teachers have collaborated to produce reports and
videotapes on policy issues, met with business leaders and elected
officials, and investigated current research on school change. Today, the
Forum Leadership Council meets twice a month with the State Superintendent
of Education and other educational policymakers. Forum members, nominated
by the state forum Leadership Council, advise legislative committees as
they draft and revise education laws and policies.
</p><p>
Despite these accomplishments, perhaps the greatest benefit of the South
Carolina Teacher Forum has been its effectiveness as a professional
development experience. The discussions that occur among teachers at these
forums have been essential first steps for teachers to work toward the
kind of meaningful change in schools that is necessary if we are to enable
all students to meet high levels of academic achievement.
</p><h3>Goals 2000 Teacher Forum</h3>
This month's Goals 2000 Teacher Forum in Washington is part of a broader
process of reinventing government, changing the way teachers feel about
what goes on in Washington, and working toward a more responsive and
effective system in which individuals have a stronger say in decisions
affecting their work and well-being. The Clinton administration recognizes
that classroom teachers are one of the most underutilized resources for
change and improvement in American education, and we plan to change that.
It should be no secret that classroom teachers possess a wealth of
knowledge and understanding about how teachingand learning occur. That is
why we are firm in our belief that any substantive and successful school
reform must be engineered in close consultation with the individuals who
work on the front lines of education.
<p>
Soon after the forum, the Department will publish a paper summarizing the
meeting, so that the views of these outstanding teachers can help guide
policymakers in developing programs, policies, and legislation which will
help teachers better serve students. Through this initiative, it is the
Department's intention to shift the focus from teachers as objects of
reform to teachers as partners in reform.
</p><p>
I believe that the Goals 2000 Teacher Forum will be a major step in
forging teacher-policymaker partnerships for planning quality education
reforms that will build the base for improving student academic
achievement nationwide. However, for this initiative to realize its full
potential, the real work must be done at the state and local levels. We
have asked the forum participants to set up their own state and local
teacher forums upon returning home to provide teachers with a greater
voice in educational issues. We have also called upon state and local
policymakers to support these efforts by recognizing the tremendous
efforts of classroom teachers and by giving then an opportunity to be
engaged in and fully contribute to the policymaking process. It is my hope
that, as a result of the forum, many more states and local communities
will begin to realize the enormous potential of teacher participation in
comprehensive education reform. .
