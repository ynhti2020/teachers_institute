<h2>About Partnership</h2>
<font size="+1">By Fred M. Hechinger</font>
</center><hr/>
Competition is the American way. Children are brought up on it. Schools
are run on it. Politicians extol it.
<p>Only in moments of crisis do we suspend it in favor of cooperation.
Today's school reformers, perhaps sensing a state of crisis, actually call
for cooperative, rather than merely competitive, learning.
</p><p>
This column considers American education to be in a state of crisis. It
believes that one of the remedies is cooperation. Let me try to make my
point:
</p><p>
Some years ago, when I was writing for <i>The New York Times,</i> I
received a letter from a high school teacher. He had read with interest a
page one report about a distinguished professor at a major university who
had reinterpreted some Biblical events, such as the parting of the Dead
Sea to let the Israelites escape their persecutors, in the light of some
natural phenomena­storms, tidal waves, earthquakes and such.
</p><p>
The teacher wrote that he was particularly taken by the story because,
several years earlier, his Middle Eastern research had led him to the same
conclusions; but nobody­no reporter, no academic press, no commercial
publisher­wanted to listen to him, let alone publish his theories. To
support his claim, he had enclosed a copy of the story as it appeared in
the newspaper of the high school where he taught at the time.
</p><p>
The story did indeed cover much the same ground that had propelled the
distinguished professor's theories to prominent display in <i>The
Times.</i>
</p><p>
The teacher's conclusion: "Of course, nobody wanted to listen to me. After
all, I was only a high school teacher."
</p><p>
I wrote a story about this and, a few days later, got a letter from
another teacher who told about some important research of his own that he
had difficulty getting published. When it finally did appear in an
academic journal, he wrote, he was identified only as a doctoral candidate
at a major university­not as a high school teacher.
</p><p>
The two stories seemed to me to tell something about the professional
status of school teachers and the relationship between them and the
teachers­pardon me, the professors­of higher education. Critics
tend to blame the teachers for whatever is wrong with the schools.
</p><p>
University professors often join that chorus. Only at moments of serious
concern, as in 1957 when Sputnik raised questions about America's
technological muscle, did professors step down from their exalted position
to try to help public school teachers to beef up their knowledge. Even
Harvard's president, James B. Conant, took a leadership role in reforming
the schools.
</p><p>
One recurring problem in past school reforms was that they tended to
ignore the school teachers. Some of the instructional packets produced by
professors and other experts were advertised as being "teacher-proof,"
hardly a complimentary message to the men and women who toiled in the
classrooms. One foundation-supported action, known as the Midwest Airborne
Television Project, used a large aircraft to beam lessons to schools in a
six-state area, without first checking with teachers about what they
wanted and when they needed it. It went out of business after it had been
ridiculed as educational crop dusting.
</p><p>
Yale abandoned that ill-fated tradition of ignoring the school teacher. By
creating the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, the university
acknowledged the importance of cooperation between its faculty and the
public school teachers. At the heart of the concept is that professors and
teachers work as colleagues in the same enterprise of improving education.
The idea is that teachers will not be viewed as professionals until they
are made partners in the professions.
</p><p>
The Yale faculty, through the Institute, has provided a model for school
college cooperation that has begun to change relationships between
colleges and schools across the nation­not yet in enough places but a
crucial beginning nevertheless. Yale's prestige has been a major factor in
making this changed relationship respectable.
</p><p> few years ago, a participating Yale professor said that the
collaboration gave him new insights into the problems and the potential of
the public schools and that, in addition, it had given him the opportunity
to work in his field with mature adults rather than mainly with college
students.
</p><p>
The realization of the virtues of partnership­not a top-down
relationship­has set a new pattern in educational reform. The promise
and the problems of this pattern at Yale and anywhere, will be the theme
of this column in the future.
