<h2>Collaboration and the Community of Leaders
</h2>

<hr/>
A  school administration is faced with a swirl of expectations that run
the gamut of leadership and managerial responsibilities. The ever growing
complexity of educating young people can almost numb a person to the task
of fostering a superb teaching and learning environment. Couple the
demands of the role with the rush to restructure and reinvent the school
environment and one can easily see that a site administrator would only
appear foolish if the opportunity to collaborate was not utilized to its
fullest extent. Gone are the days of the principal as the sole source of
authority on instruction, curriculum, staff development, and school
governance. Staring us squarely in the face is the redefinition of
professional growth, empowerment, and decision making through the use of
collegiality and collaboration.
<p>
The goal of any improvement process in the schools should be
improved through student learning. All other aspects of a school should
support that goal. As a site leader, the principal must make sure that
intent of the school is clear to all. The leader must give meaning to the
mutually agreed upon vision. The leader must trust the collective wisdom
of the teachers. It takes collaboration to have these things happen. The
leader must be willing to collaborate to have collaboration happen. This
requires a role redefinition for many principals. It will also require an
understanding and commitment to collaboration beyond rhetoric. The bounty
of collaborative efforts can truly be wonderful. 
</p><p>
Clearly we are living in a world that demands mutual dependence.
We see this in environmental issues, business affairs, politcal decisions
and personal growth. In education the emphasis on cooperative learning,
mentorship, apprenticeship, peer tutoring, family plans, RE: Learning,
learning styles, equity issues, and improved understanding of
developmentally appropriate instruction demand the skill of working
together for a common goal. This emphasis provides the perfect medium for
collaboration.
</p><h3>Collaboration</h3>
Collaboration has a synergistic power. We are smarter together
than we are apart. The power of collaboration can be seen in self renewal,
staff development, shared inquiry, community building, and practical
application of theory. All of these are crucial. The elements comprise an
array of leadership needs that would be impossible for a site
administrator to deal with effectively alone all educational practitioners
must take part in the process.
<p>	Self renewal is a tremendous benefit of collaboration. It has the
potential to rekindle the zest and joy that can be so easily bruised in
the veteran teacher. Self renewal can energize the beginning teacher by
easing the isolation and loneliness of teaching and by increasing best
practices. The renewal process allows the university professor to examine
effective teaching techniques of the practitioner as well as to observe
content development in the schools. The renewal of self is like opening a
door both ways...it allows one to see more clearly the inner self and it
allows one to see the context of endeavor in new ways. It helps to develop
and articulate a personal philosophical stance and gain clarity of vision
and purpose. All of these actions empower the participants.
</p><p>	The staff development aspect of collaboration has untold value for
the professional growth of teachers. The most powerful aspect is that
teachers and professors do indeed become learners. The power of working
together to seek common understanding allows teachers to better their
craft and professors to refine their practice. The collaborative model
recognizes and celebrates each person s expertise. Teachers, working with
other teachers, truly do have the answers to improve instruction.
</p><p>	Shared inquiry in a collaborative setting allows for a dialogue
focused on learning as a continuous process. The most proficient teachers
know that their work is never quite done... in fact more questions arise
than do answers. Shared inquiry is a means to frame both the questions and
the answers in ways that make sense for both students and teachers. Shared
inquiry is the process that personalizes the curriculum development
process and adds dimension to content. Shared inquiry allows the professor
to reconceptualize the core of his or her expertise so that all learners
may have access to the importance of the knowledge. If all parties come to
the process with an open mind and the willingness to learn, the result can
have tremendous power to shape insight and discourse.
</p><p>	Collaboration has broken down the lines of difference between
learning institutions. This has allowed for the building of a community
which focuses on effective instruction and effective transmission of
knowledge. The building of community is so important. Collaboration, and
all of the social implications that go along with it, allows people to
develop a process to capitalize on expertise, solve problems, create and
celebrate understandings, explore possibilities and share what is known. A
teacher or a professor going through this process is part of a bigger
whole which is supportive and resource rich.
</p><h3>Collaboration as Integration</h3>
There is continued dissonance between the theoretical insights
often associated with the university and the reality of the classroom. The
two worlds often do not understand each other but, at the same time, have
a dependence upon one another. Teachers typically are not in an
environment in which the organization values reflection. Professors often
don t know the rigors of facing up to 160 students daily. Teachers are
expected to change and do more, yet have little opportunity to internalize
the change and do things with more wisdom. Professors have the wealth of
their research and extensive knowledge yet seldom have the opportunity to
utilize these resources with other educators in actual learning settings
beyond the university. Collaboration gives opportunity to bring harmony to
theory and practice. This harmony addresses the instructor s desire to
continuously improve and the theoretician s desire to apply research. This
meld of approaches results in both parties having an increased
appreciation of each other s expertise, situation and commitment to
learning.
<p>	Collaboration is a means to connect the spectrum of educational
endeavor. The roles of teacher and professor develop into the role of
learner. In essence, it allows for continuous learning and for continued
professional growth. Collaboration also sets up a sense of continued
obligation between the teaching community and the teaching profession.
This obligation is manifested in both the desire to improve student
outcomes and the desire to expand the application of content. The
obligation actually empowers the teacher with an expanded knowledge base
and improved instructional capacity. The obligation also develops the
professor s sense of the interconnected nature of knowledge which is the
conceptual goal of the university.
</p><p>	An important aspect of collaboration is a support group that is
established as a result of the process. The group serves as an extended
network which can stay in touch. The common experience, shared vocabulary
and personal connection links people together. The group becomes a
resource for analysis, refinement for technique and quick feedback. This
group also takes on new leadership roles because of its unique ability to
construct meaning and develop instructional methodology. These new
leadership roles support the site administrator by expanding the use of
constant instructional improvement and professional development.
</p><h3>The Present Task</h3>
Some site administrators and professors may see pitfalls in
collaboration. The pitfalls are actually illusions used by those who are
afraid to give up control or power. There are those who do not know how or
do not care to work together. Collaboration requires a redefinition and
redistribution of leadership. The leader must become a acilitator of the
process rather than the director. The leader must establish an environment
where inquiry replaces prescription. The leader must be honest and admit
that it is impossible to know how to address all the complex issues of a
contemporary school setting. The leader must develop a collegial, rather
than a disenfranchised, environment. Finally, the leader must realize
working together is process oriented. It is the process that enables
learners to internalize and apply concepts. Collaboration builds a
community of learners which, in turn, develops an even larger community of
learners including students with their enhanced understanding of the
world.
