<h4><i>Sheila W. Wellington :</i></h4>
Ladies and gentlemen, friends of the Teachers Institute, thanks very much.
I will only speak briefly; there are other delights to come. I did want a
chance to speak from my perspective as someone who is involved in the
community work of Yale University about the Teachers Institute as an
institution that has endured and continues to contribute. When an
institution does that, it is of course the work of many people, not just
one person, and that surely is the case with the Teachers Institute. But
there is in fact one person without whom there would not be this
extraordinary entity, and that person is Jim Vivian. Without Jim Vivian
there would be no Teachers Institute. [Applause]
<p>Let me take a minute for those of you who don t know a little of the
history. Jim was in the History Department here in the late seventies.
Howard Lamar was chair of the Department at that time, and there was
created the Yale-New Haven History Education Project.  It was started at
the initiative of some Lee High School faculty people who were teaching
history, who came to the History Department here and said, "an we work
together, can we collaborate so that we can learn something, hopefully you
can learn something, and our students can profit?" The project was started
by Howard. It was a success. Jim was involved in it. It was so good that
there was a decision to expand it beyond the History Department, and
submit a grant to the NEH. This was by then, I guess, the late seventies.
Jim Vivian agreed to write the grant, but said he would not run the
Teachers Institute. But on the form great things always happen because of
forms it said "director of the program" and they had to fill in a name,
and they filled in the name, Jim Vivian. The project was, in fact, funded,
and the Teachers Institute is, as you know, commencing its fourteenth
year. It has had a very, very bright past, and it is surely going to have
a brilliant future. So thank you, and welcome, and thanks to Jim.
</p><h4><i>James R. Vivian:</i></h4>
Thank you, Sheila. I do appreciate what you say, but at the same time you
are quite right in saying that the Institute is the product of the efforts
of a great many people, many of whom are here today, which pleases me very
much.
<p>I, too, welcome you all to our celebration today. We come together, I
believe, out of a shared commitment to the best possible education for the
young people in the public schools of New Haven. We join together today to
honor more than three hundred of their teachers who have completed the
program since 1978, many of them more than once; to recognize the many
teachers that have served in the leadership of our program; to appreciate
the contribution that more than 70 faculty members have made through
leading seminars and giving talks in the program; to thank the numerous
School and University administrators, many of whom are here, for their
help at so many points, including some trying times in the history of the
program; to express gratitude to the Institute's past and current funders,
many of whom are represented here; to welcome the Institute s friends,
many of you here, and to thank you for your interest; and most especially
today to celebrate two magnificent new grants and the promise that they
hold for the Institute s future.
</p><p>When the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund in a major breakthrough
for us announced last October a $2 million endowment challenge grant, the
Institute became the first permanently endowed program of its type.
Writing in The New York Times, Fred Hechinger said of the grant this past
December that it signaled a "new era" in university school collaboration
nationally. In New Haven, at least, it certainly represents the fact that
the University's educational resources will always be made available to
assist the teachers and through them the students in our community s
public schools.
</p><p>So, I do not exaggerate when I say that the Institute has no greater
friend or stronger ally than Donna V. Dunlop, who is the Program Director
at the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, who has expressed such a full
measure of confidence in the lasting significance of the Institute. She
has, moreover, become a valued colleague in this work. Donna, on behalf of
everyone here, it is a personal pleasure to welcome you back to New Haven,
and on behalf of the generations of teachers and students in our schools
to come, we thank you most sincerely.
</p><h4><i>Donna V. Dunlop:</i></h4>
Thank you, Jim. Good evening. I am very, very pleased to be here this
evening to celebrate the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. But more
important than that, I am pleased to be here to celebrate the teachers and
the Yale faculty who are the heart of this program, and more important
than that, to celebrate the children who are the recipients of this good
work. They are really why we are here today, and I want to always impress
upon people that that's really why we re doing the work that we're doing.
<p>This project has had a long history, it seems to me; though it's only
been three years, it seems longer than that. Starting back in 1988 when a
soft-spoken Jim Vivian came to me in my office in New York City and spoke
eloquently and with great conviction about a wonderful program and a
program that he really believed in, and at that time I sat back in my
foundation chair and said, "Yes, but we don t do New Haven. And, indeed we
are only funding in New York City right now." But Jim Vivian persisted and
continued to talk to me about the value of this program and we continued
to talk and, fortunately at that time, we were also developing a program
focused on teachers and teacher development and strengthening the people
who serve young people in an effort to ensure that the best services were
delivered to them every day. So we kept talking and what resulted was a
three-year, $225,000 grant to the Institute. That s really where the story
begins because then everything began to change at the DeWitt Wallace
Reader's Digest Fund.
</p><p>We went from having one staff person the staff person being me  to
having seven staff people. This happened in December 1989.  More
important than that, our grants budget tripled and we were given the
charge by our Board of Directors to create a national grant- making
program a luxurious, wonderful challenge, I have to say.  We began to
look for models with promise around the country, and naturally we
looked back to our friends. But we were looking for programs that had
certain characteristics. We looked for programs that were more than
"one-shot deals," that had the potential for effecting change over a
long period of time. We were still focused on teachers, and we were
looking for programs that showed respect for teachers, treated them as
professionals, and allowed them to grow as professionals. We looked for 
programs that partnered public schools with other institutions because
we believe that public schools cannot work in isolation any more and
that they need to work with other organizations in the community, and a 
group like Yale University is as ideal as it could be in that regard.
</p><p>We also looked for programs that had investments local investments
that we wouldn't just be coming in as a private funder and picking up
the tab. We were looking for public and private monies to be invested
in projects as well. Any time we can leverage funds we try to do that,
and we were looking for models that had application outside of the
individual project. We are always looking to find elements of projects
that we can help to then "go on the road," as we say. And most
important, we were looking for projects, as I said, that have an impact 
on children.
</p><p>It was clear that the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute had all of
those characteristics. So we went back to Jim, and I think you were
happy when we actually picked up the phone and said, "Let s talk,"
because you were in the midst of a three-year grant at that time and we 
negotiated. And as you've heard what happened was that the Board of
Directors of the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund approved a $2
million endowment grant a challenge grant to the Institute. The intent
of this was to stabilize the Institute, to leverage additional funds.
</p><p>The work isn't over. Jim still needs to raise more funds. If there
are any grant-makers in the audience, you should know the job is not
done. We still need more support for the Institute. The package that
was put together we were very pleased with. After my conversations with 
Institute teachers and Yale Faculty, I feel very sure that this was an
investment a very smart investment and that's the best thing that a
foundation person can say. I am very pleased to be here today and I
thank all of you for being there.  Thanks.
</p><h4><i>James R. Vivian:</i></h4>
The unfailing support of the National Endowment for the Humanities since
1978 has been indispensable to the Institute's development and has allowed
us to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.  The new grant which
we are announcing today brings the total of their support to almost $1 1/2
million over a sixteen-year period, ending at the end of 1993. The NEH has
thus provided well for the undiminished continuation of our program in the
humanities, bringing us to the threshold of real financial stability, and
at the same time making it possible for us to concentrate now in our fund
raising on building an adequate endowment.
<p>I first had the pleasure of working with James Herbert when he was
Director of Academic Relations at the College Board. I worked with him
there on the publication of the Institute s first report, <i>Teaching in
America: The Common Ground, </i>which was initially prepared, in fact, for
a national conference of university presidents and Chief State School
Officers held in this room in 1983. He has had a long and significant
professional involvement in this business of university-school
collaboration, and so it is a particular pleasure to welcome him back to
New Haven today in his new capacity as Director of the Education Division
of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
</p><h4><i>James Herbert:</i></h4>
The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has always been about the engagement
of teachers with their subject matter. So, I thought it might be
appropriate to return to my ancient discipline just for a moment to put
this moment in the historical context of the school reform movement in the
United States in the last several years. That movement can be said to have
begun in 1977, when a commission headed by former Secretary of Labor,
Willard Wirtz, reported to the College Board that the alarming
fifteen-year decline in national average SAT scores could be attributed at
least partially to an erosion of standards across the board educationally.
Later that same year the National Endowment for the Humanities announced
that the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute would receive a grant of
$290,000 to support a program in which the teachers of New Haven would
engage in sustained, serious study of their subject areas working with
faculty of Yale University.
<p>That program was to be founded on four principles. The first was that
teachers and teacher-developed materials are utterly central to the whole
business of improving education. The second was that teachers at various
levels, at different levels at secondary and higher education, can and
must work together as colleagues to address the problems of teaching in
their disciplines. The third principle was that any such educational
improvement effort ought to be led in large portion by the teachers
themselves. And finally, the program was to be founded on the principle
that school-university collaboration, in order to be effective, had to be
over the long term.
</p><p>In 1983 the school reform movement reached its most dramatic moment
when a National Commission on Excellence in Education warned that the
nation was "at risk." It said that American education had reached such a
state that, if it had been imposed on us by a foreign power, we would have
regarded it as an act of war. Also in 1983, the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute received a grant of $368,000 from the National Endowment for the
Humanities to support a program of serious, sustained study by New Haven
teachers working with colleagues on the Yale University faculty.  That
program was to be founded on and to embody four principles: the utter
centrality of teachers; the necessity of co professionalism between
teachers and their colleagues on the Yale faculty; the importance of
teacher leadership in the governance of any such enterprise; and, yes,
that any school-university collaboration, in order to be effective, had to
be a commitment for the long term.
</p><p>In 1986 the school reform movement reached what many people called its
"second wave." A pair of reports, one from the National Governors
Association, the other from the Task Force on Teaching as a Profession,
called for reorienting the movement to the future, and called for a
reprofessionalization of the teaching force of the United States and for a
consequent restructuring of schools and of schooling.  Also in 1986 the
National Endowment for the Humanities offered Yale University, the
teachers of New Haven, the Teachers Institute, a grant of $345,000 to
allow teachers in New Haven to engage in serious, sustained study in their
subject areas, working with Yale faculty in a program that was to be
founded yes, you re getting the message, on four principles: the utter
centrality of teachers to any school reform effort; the importance of co
professionalism between teachers and university faculty in addressing the
problems common to teaching their disciplines; the leadership, the
necessity of leadership of teachers in the governance of any such
enterprise; and indeed, that any school-university collaboration ought to
be for the long term.
</p><p>Last year, in 1990, in the State of the Union message the President of
the United States announced that he and the governors of the fifty states
had reached a consensus on six national goals for American education. One
of those goals was that by the year 2000 students in the fourth, the
eighth, and the twelfth grade should demonstrate competence in the mastery
of challenging subject matter in such fields as English, History,
Mathematics, Science. Also in 1990 the National Endowment for the
Humanities announced that the Yale- New Haven Teachers Institute would
receive a grant of $480,000 to support the serious and sustained study by
New Haven teachers working with faculty members of Yale University. Yes,
again, that program was to be founded on four general and compelling
principles. I need not enumerate them, but I might mention that over the
years Yale has, together with the teachers of New Haven, taken many means
to spread those principles across the nation to larger and larger groups
of people, who have found in them a message of importance to their own
work.
</p><p>Among the means was this little book that Jim and I worked on several
years ago, <i>Teaching in America: The Common Ground.</i> While I adore
this little book, (This was my first editing effort I never told him)
there is a passage in it which has always mystified me. Jim explains that
the involvement in this kind of enterprise, that's to say the Teachers
Institute, was a matter whose reasons "transcended altruism." Now, as a
philosopher, I have some difficulty coming up with a reason or a motive
that "transcends altruism." But as a historian, I know very well that the
principles and the practice of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute the
insight, seriousness, steadfastness with which it has held to those
principles has transcended many transient waves of reform in American
education and has made a large and lasting contribution to the work that
many educators have been involved in over the past fifteen years.
</p><p>I'd like to let one 1990 panelist speak for successive generations of
NEH review panelists as to the nature of that contribution. This panelist
wrote: "The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is one of the oldest, most
successful university-school collaborative projects in the country. There
is every credible indication that the Institute really works, not only
significantly to enhance the quality of education in the New Haven Public
Schools, but to serve as an active witness and effective model for other
collaborative projects across the country."
</p><p>My own list of Standard Metropolitan Statistical areas in the United
States lists 66 such areas which are larger than New Haven, and a total of
114 which are of at least comparable size, and in every one of them there
are teachers and faculty who would profit from heeding this witness, from
following the example that you all have set.
</p><p>The National Endowment for the Humanities, on the occasion of its
second grant to this Institute, expressed the hope that the program here
would become permanent and that universities and schools in other
communities would establish similar programs for their mutual benefit. On
this occasion, I and my colleagues wish to congratulate the Institute, Jim
personally, the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Foundation, and most of all
the teachers of New Haven, and, yes, the teachers of Yale University as
well, on this important step toward making the Institute permanent, so
that soon we can all move to the second part of that agenda one of my
colleagues set some time ago: fulfilling the promise that this Institute
holds for teachers and for students, not only in New Haven, but across the
country.
</p><p>I think you know that I believe that your work here holds at least four
lessons for teachers in other parts of the country.
</p><h4><i>James R. Vivian:</i></h4>
From hearing Jim and Donna speak, I trust that you gain an impression of
how rewarding my job is in working with them.
<p>From the outset the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has been planned
through close cooperation between the University and the New Haven Public
Schools. The Schools jointly support the Institute and, in fact, the
Institute has become an increasingly integral part of their offerings
which assist teachers in meeting the Connecticut requirements for
recertification as professional educators. In recent years we have worked
especially closely and very fruitfully, I must add with Marc Palmieri, who
is Supervisor of Staff and Organizational Development for the schools,
especially in the formulation of these policies. In working with him we
have strengthened our ties with the Schools, and so I very much appreciate
that he is representing the New Haven Public School system this afternoon.
</p><h4><i>Marc Palmieri:</i></h4>
Thank you. I bring greetings from Dr. Dow. He is in a budget meeting at
this present time with the Board members. We are especially pleased with
the enhancement of the Institute. It is very important to recognize that
during the past year or two there have been substantial both national and
state trends which have increased teacher participation in a number of
professional activities. In working with Jim and the Institute we have
been able to integrate the two to our advantage and to the advantage of
the students, ultimately. There is a challenge however that I am concerned
with, and I must say here. In the state of Connecticut anybody beneath the
title of Superintendent is considered a teacher, and I think one of the
things that is very important as we've looked at the whole empowerment
issue and as we ve looked at site-based management and you know of our
national work in and around school planning and management teams etc., it
is critical to recognize that the administrator is a key component and
himself or herself is in fact a teacher. And I would challenge us to
consider in the next couple of years how in fact we might afford the
opportunities of the Institute to our administrators who are working more
collaboratively with their staffs, because the challenge of education has
grown considerably and we now recognize that it takes a highly
collaborative effort to in fact make the kind of planning and in
implementing the kinds of programs that are necessary. We're excited with
this. We see a great potential. And we've been excited for our teachers
and directly the input and the implication this has with our students.
Thank you very much.
<h4><i>James R. Vivian:</i></h4>
The Institute has also always represented a partnership between Yale and
New Haven. From the outset I have thought, in fact, that of all the ways
the University and the City might collaborate, it is most natural and
indeed centrally important that they collaborate in the field of
education. When in 1978 we announced the first NEH grant to the Institute,
that news conference was the first in anyone s memory between a Mayor of
New Haven and the President of the University on the subject of education
in New Haven. Mayor John Daniels in his administration has placed
emphasis, as the Institute does, on the well-being of the children in our
community, and so it is especially gratifying to me that he makes the time
to be with us today.
<h4><i>Mayor John Daniels:</i></h4>
Thank you very much, and it's a pleasure to stand here and be part of the
acknowledgment and ceremonies for the nearly one-half million dollar grant
which the National Endowment is presenting to the Yale-New Haven Teachers
Institute. For thirteen years this Institute has represented a model
partnership between the University community at Yale and the City of New
Haven. We have recently forged new links and new understanding in the
beginnings of a new and closer relationship between the University and the
City.  I must say that it was the existence of this kind of program which
long preceded our recent "town-gown" agreement, which lent credence to the
possibility that such a deeper relationship and agreement could be forged.
The Institute, whose work with our local teachers is a model of the
University s and City s mutual cooperation and benefit, and I'm here
tonight to congratulate all those involved for the hard work and for the
good results. Congratulations, and keep up the good work. Thank you.
<h4><i>James R. Vivian:</i></h4>
In the Institute's field of endeavor it is well-established, well-known to
people close to this kind of work, that collaborative programs survive
only if they enjoy strong support from the head of the institution of
which they are a part. So, the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has
indeed been fortunate in Yale's current President, Benno Schmidt. The
decisions he has made recently are the seminal ones ensuring the Institute
s continuation and permanence. So, I want publicly to thank him for his
belief in this work, and for his remarks today.
<h4><i>Benno C. Schmidt, Jr.:</i></h4>
Jim is, as always, very gracious, and he gives me altogether too much
credit. Actually, what I recall this evening as I think about this great
success we re celebrating is the advice I once got from a teacher in grade
school who said to me, "Ben, you must always have the courage of your
ignorance." When five years ago I had just been named President of Yale
but had not formally assumed the position, I found myself on one of my
first visits to New Haven under Jim Vivian's wing, as it were, in a group
of people talking about this very fine Institute the great work that it
did. I had a few staff people who were there to keep me out of trouble,
and, in the course of the discussion of the Institute's very severe
financial problems at that time, Jim asked me, "did I not think that
something of this value ought to be a permanent part of the University and
the City of New Haven? Did I not think that something of this value ought
to be endowed, and wouldn t I commit the University and myself to that
venture?"
<p>"Well, sure," I said, "it sounds like a great idea." At that point my
Director of Development fainted dead away at the table because it is an
informed article of faith in the world of development that endowment
grants for the perpetual support of institutions of this kind
notwithstanding their great value are by the very reason of the fact that
they stretch across so many institutions and so many social opportunities
and problems, that endowment grants for such enterprises are the most
difficult, almost impossible grants, to enlist.  So, there in my
innocence, I committed Yale that it would be an important institutional
priority of mine to try to see to it that this magnificent collaboration,
resting on so many years of dedicated work and experience, would become a
permanent part of the partnership that the Mayor just referred to, that we
are continually trying to strengthen, between Yale and New Haven, for the
benefit of the University and all of us who are citizens of New Haven, and
for the benefit especially of the future and the children who are our
future.
</p><p>So, I'm extremely pleased that the marvelous people you ve just heard
from representing these two fine enterprises: one the private, non-profit
DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Foundation with this extraordinarily
generous and seminal, as Jim said, $2 million challenge endowment grant
for the Institute, and I am so grateful to the National Endowment for the
continuing support that the Endowment has given. Shortly after I became
President the Endowment's support for the Institute was one of the
highlights of my first few weeks here and led me to see the Institute's
future in terms of such promise and such possibility that we re here
celebrating today.
</p><p>Five years ago most people in this room would have thought that what
we're celebrating today was not possible. Fortunately, one of those was
not Jim Vivian, whose faith in the value of this effort and along with the
faculty members from Yale and some New Haven teachers I have met who have
told me how valuable this was to them and to the students in the New Haven
Public Schools. They had the faith that enables us to celebrate this
event.
</p><p>So let me return, somewhat less innocent now, but let me return to my
hope and faith of five years ago: These splendid gifts will be the
beginning of further efforts on our part to strengthen this Institute on
behalf of the teachers and students of New Haven, and the benefits this
Institute offers our faculty, which are important benefits. We will
continue with the help of these two very generous grants to make this
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute as good as the best ought to be. It is
the best, and so we must make it as good as the best ought to be in
university-public education collaboration in this area.
</p><p>This is a very, very happy day for me, and I want to express my
personal appreciation to our friends who journeyed to New Haven and to the
organizations they represent who have given us something truly to
celebrate.
</p><p>Champagne?
