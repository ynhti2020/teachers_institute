The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute was established in 1978 as a joint
program of Yale University and the New Haven Public Schools, funded with
grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities and other sources.
<p>The Institute has a small staff housed at Yale. Each year School
Representatives in New Haven's high, middle, elementary and special
schools canvass other teachers for ideas about the kinds of seminars they
would find useful. A fundamental principle of the Institute is that the
curriculum is generated by the school teachers. James Vivian, Director of
the Institute since its inception, talks with Yale faculty about offering
seminars in the areas of teacher interest. Then the School Representatives
select the seminars in which there is strongest interest. Teachers apply
for admission, proposing topics to be developed in the seminar as
curriculum units to which they will teach the following year, and which
are published and made available to other interested teachers in the
school system. The seminar leader reviews the applications, and fine tunes
the planned reading and discussions to fit the interests of the accepted
participants. In the end, up to eighty school teachers are accepted as
Fellows enrolled in one of the six or seven seminars in the five month
program. Fellows are full members of the Yale community, with library,
parking, gym, and other regular privileges. During the seminar, the leader
works with one teacher in the course designated as the Institute
Coordinator, who helps with curricular and operational matters. Upon
successful completion of their units, teachers receive an honorarium,
continuing education units toward their periodic recertification as
professional educators in Connecticut, and possible course credit at an
institution where they may be working toward a degree.
</p><p>The seminars meet once in March and once in April, when both the
schools and the university are in session, for purposes of orientation,
bibliography, and firm definition of unit topics. Individual conferences
are held during this period. Seminars then meet weekly from mid-May to mid
July, and the final units are submitted in early August.
</p><p>I have offered three seminars in the Institute, all of which had a
similar theoretical underpinning. The theory, in brief, derives from the
idea that all artifacts that is, all human-made objects, including works
of art are fragments of history that embody the beliefs of the culture
that produced them. They are historical events things that happened in the
past but, unlike other historical events, continue to exist in the
present. They can therefore be reexperienced, affording a special mode of
non-verbal, affective access to other cultures. Pedagogically, this
provides an opportunity for making other times and other places, other
ways of life and thought, more comprehensible to students who have
difficulty absorbing verbal information, or who are immediately dismissive
of cultures different from their own. It also enables young people who
lack verbal or mathematical skills to extract information from things,
whether about their own family, their own community, or their own social,
religious or ethnic heritage. Four out of five school children in New
Haven are from minority groups, and units on African, Hispanic,
preColumbian and Native American cultures are particularly popular.
</p><p>In my seminars, we use close analysis of objects as a means of
understanding culture. It involves application of a simple methodology
that I described in an article entitled "Mind in Matter: an Introduction
to Material Culture Theory and Method," published in the <i>Winterthur
Portfolio</i> in 1982 [Vol. 17, No. 1, Spring]. I will discuss the
methodology more fully in a minute.
</p><p>The seminar I gave last year on "The Family in Art and Material
Culture" was structured around the analysis of images of the family and,
to a lesser extent, objects of everyday life. Emphasis was placed on key
stages of family life birth, childhood, marriage, parenthood, aging and
death. As in all of the seminars, we used close analysis of objects not
only to absorb factual historical evidence but to dig beneath the surface
to find unconscious expressions of cultural belief. Each class meeting
focused on the analysis of a single object. Let me summarize rapidly the
procedure as applied to one object to convey a sense of what we did in
class.
</p><p>[Analysis of William Dobson, <i>The Streatfeild Family?</i>, Yale
Center for British Art five minutes]
</p><p>The class contained equal representation of elementary, middle and high
schools, and there was no correlation between the level of teaching and
the quality of work done in the seminar. Four participants taught Social
Studies or History, four were art teachers, and two were French teachers
with a cultural/historical leaning in selecting materials for language
instruction. With the emphasis on methodology, my seminars seem to have
been particularly useful to the teachers in developing <i>practical
</i>aspects of their teaching lesson plans.
In seminar meetings we analyze <i>museum</i> objects, but in preparing
their units the teachers are encouraged to subject everyday materials to
the same kind of close analysis. Their students in turn can study pictures
in magazines, family snapshots, or other items of everyday life around
them. The museum is used not as a treasure house that contains sanctioned
objects of beauty and value, but as a training ground for learning to
extract understanding from things. This affective way of learning works
for non literate as well as literate students, and offers opportunities
for students who may seem backward to excel through visual acuity, or
creativity in executing projects in the curriculum unit.
</p><p>One pervasive aspect of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute is
collegiality. The seminar leaders from the Yale faculty bring greater
subject matter knowledge and expertise to bear; the school teachers bring
much greater practical classroom knowledge. The seminars are collegian
undertakings conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect. In working in a
collegian way with school teachers, we Yale professors seventy-four of
whom have been involved with the Institute in its fifteen years of
existence we Yale professors learn much about the craft we profess, about
what it means to be a teacher. It is easy to teach Yale students give them
the right materials and ask the right questions and they teach themselves.
In the Institute we become aware of the extraordinary accomplishments of
dedicated New Haven school teachers who work in environments that are not
conducive to learning, and we learn from their sensitivity and
responsiveness to the needs of individual students. Like all teachers, we
learn through teaching.
