Task"<br/> December 5, 1991</h2></center>
<hr/>
Thank you very much, Jim, for this flattering and wonderful introduction
and for your applause. You know, John Gardner has said the wise speaker
savors the applause that he gets before he speaks.
<p>It's been a wonderful day up to now. I feel a little like the man who
has lived through the Johnstown Flood and spent his life speaking about
that event. When he finally died and went to heaven and St. Peter welcomed
him at the gate, he said, "I'm very happy to be here, but before I settle
down, I would like you to call everybody together so I can deliver my
lecture on the Johnstown Flood." St. Peter said, "That's alright. We can
arrange that; but I want to warn you that Noah will be in the audience."
</p><p>Now I find myself here surrounded by Noahs with whom I spent the
morning listening to wonderful talks and speeches, and I will try after
that great day to speak very briefly, especially since I know that I am
really talking to the converted. But even though you are converted, you
are the ones who will have to spread the word and deliver the message.
</p><p>Before I get to the message, I'd like to do a little history. Not more
than five or six years ago when I was at the <i>Times, </i>I got a letter
one day from a teacher who wrote that he had been most interested in a
page one story in the <i>Times </i>that told about a distinguished
professor at a major institution who had reinterpreted some important
Biblical events a student of Middle Eastern history and had reinterpreted
them in line of certain natural phenomena and disasters that had since
come to light. The teacher wrote that he was very interested in that story
particularly since he himself had several years earlier come to the same
conclusion in his research but nobody wanted to listen to it or print it.
He enclosed in the letter a copy of a high school newspaper of that early
date which, in fact, did tell very much the same story as the story on
page one of the <i>Times.</i> Then he concluded his letter: "Of course,
nobody wanted to listen to me because, after all, I was only a high school
teacher."

discussed today, tell some of the problems of the relationship between
teachers in the public schools and teachers in higher education. In
criticizing what's wrong with the schools, we always tend to blame the
teacher. You remember in the 1950s it was Professor Besta who used his
university credentials to blame the teachers in the schools for creating
what he called an educational wasteland. Then, in the 1960s something
happened, largely because of Sputnik and the fear of the United States
being surpassed by the Soviet Union. At that time, that earlier time of
efforts at school reform, professors from the universities did take part,
step down to help the high schools. There was Zacharias at MIT in physics,
Bentley Glass at Hopkins in chemistry, and I think I remember some
mathematicians at Yale. Harvard's President Conant joined the school
reform movement, and great books and great programs were produced, new
teaching materials.
</p.i></p><p>But there was one problem: The classroom teacher was generally ignored.
As a matter of fact, many of the materials that were sent to the schools
were advertised as being "teacher-proof." Now you can imagine if a
manufacturer who made surgical instruments sent his sales people to
doctors offices and tried to sell those instruments as being doctor-proof,
you can imagine what would happen to that. At the very end of this reform
without the teachers, one of our major foundations supported or created
something called the Midwest Airborne Television Project which consisted
of a large airplane, a DC- 7, circling over a six-state area all day long
and beaming television programs to thousands of classrooms in those states
without ever having checked with the teachers, what they wanted or when
they wanted it, and eventually, that program went out of business after
some of its critics referred to it as educational crop dusting. 
</p><p>What we are doing today shows that things have changed, that something
is being realized, that the teacher is not only the key, but the teacher
also generally works and lives in isolation. Yale, 15 years ago, broke the
defeatist pattern that teachers really are not the important part of any
attempt to reform the schools and, working directly with the high schools
and now even with elementary schools, the teachers were brought into
collaboration as you know with the college faculty. The fact is and we
have heard it today and we have known it for some time teachers will not
act as professionals until they are made partners in profession. A few
years ago Claire Guadiani, then at the University of Pennsylvania, created
a movement which got college teachers, elementary school teachers, high
school teachers together just to meet socially once a month, the way
doctors and lawyers meet in their county and other organizations, and it
made a change.
</p><p>The Yale example, I think, is important because, first of all, the
prestige of the institution and, I will add only somewhat facetiously,
perhaps because it has no school of Education. I stress that in a way
because I've been on advisory boards to other institutions, one of them
being Stanford and Stanford was a good model. It was a good model in
dealing with six neighboring school districts, but Stanford has a graduate
school of Education and so the arts and science faculty always sort of
felt, let the school of Education take care of it. At Yale, as you know,
the faculty of the entire institution has taken part in this important
project.
What I'm trying to say and incidentally what Donna Dunlop stressed this
morning is the important message that education ought to be a seamless
fabric from birth through graduate school and beyond and, all along the
way, teachers matter on all levels first, the first teachers the parents
who read to their two-year olds, then the underpaid and overworked child
care worker, the kindergarten teacher, the teachers in the schools at all
levels and, finally, you at Yale and other colleges and universities, you
the people at the top of the pyramid. In this collaborative, you don't
look down condescendingly or in scorn at what the schools are doing, but
you are only the intelligent and caring few.
</p><p>We were told today that nationwide some 450 professors are taking part
annually in similar collaboratives. That sounds impressive and considering
that only a few years ago, there were very few, if any, it is impressive.
But it's only one-tenth of one percent of American faculties and that, it
seems to me, remains the university's truly neglected task. If you think
things need to be improved, reformed, step down from your elevated
positions, tell your colleagues who have not stepped down yet, and find
out how you can help. Higher education faculties have been given a lot of
advantages and it's only right for them to share them with the teachers in
the schools. The benefits will come back to them in the form of better
students.
</p><p>You have truly pointed the way. Jim Vivian has built something of great
importance. This morning, an elementary school teacher spoke of some six
year olds who are already experts in certain fields and ask questions that
she, the teacher, answers with the help of Yale professors. That's
collaboration. A professor said that the Institute has given him a new
insight into the schools, and he added that it also has allowed him to
work with adults, rather than only with college students. A teacher said,
"We are organized to death," speaking of her schools. The collaborative
means freedom. "The curriculum part is wonderful," she said, "but also a
hotel room of my own, and I can soak in the tub and read a book. All of
that other professionals have long taken for granted. As a matter of fact,
they may even have had a jacuzzi." One teacher this afternoon said, "we
are hovering at the brink of real change." You in the collaborative can
help these teachers to make it to the other side of the brink into a new
world of education.
