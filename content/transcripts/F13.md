<p>
Thank you all for coming back in and taking the time to continue the
dialogue. As our second does­anybody want to answer the question,
"which
is the painting that did not come here from American tobacco?" The second
part of this morning's presentation talks about another connection Yale
has in the community with the process of teaching. And let me introduce to
you the Chair of this panel, Professor Thomas Whitaker, who holds degrees
both from Oberlin and from Yale Graduate School. He has served as Chairman
of the English Department at Yale, where he has taught since 1975, and has
since had an appointment as a Professor of Theater Studies, with interests
from Tom Stoppard to William Carlos Williams to William Butler Yeats, and
perhaps other three­named authors, a trustee to the Long Wharf
theater, and has recently, as part of his work as a seminar leader, is a
member of the advisory board of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.
It's a cooperative program begun twenty years ago or more, and he and his
colleagues, Professor Wegener of Engineering and Professor Winks of
History, will shed some light on that process. Professor Whitaker...

<h4><i>Professor Thomas Whitaker:</i></h4>
<p>
Thank you. It seems to me very appropriate that we move from Edith
MacMullen's program in teacher preparation to the Yale­New Haven
Teachers Institute because Yale's concern for education and training for
education certainly continues in many guises even despite difficulties. As
a matter of fact, I hope that one result of our comments during the next
hour and twenty minutes or so will be that we can somewhat rectify the
balance with regard to some of the statements made about Yale faculty's
interest in education during the last session. It's not that the
Yale­New Haven Teachers Institute is widely known among Yale faculty,
I suppose, no prophet is without honor except in his own land, but it does
have a smal­relatively smal­contingent of very dedicated people
from across many fields.  I've been asked to talk first for twenty,
twenty­five minutes about the nature of this program, its history,
its procedures, with a few comments having to do with my own involvement
in it, and then I will introduce somewhat more formally Peter Wegener and
Robin Winks, who will speak for ten, fifteen minutes each on their
particular experiences with the Institute, and then we want to save at
least twenty minutes or so for questions from you, on the assumption that
the most interesting things will probably come out when we are subjected
to that questioning by you.
</p><p>
As you're aware, at the point when the Department of Education was phased
out, the M.A.T. had come into being during the 1950s, and when the M.A.T.
phased out in 1970, the University decided to concentrate its attention
formally on undergraduate teacher education, and you've heard about that
program. But concern for teacher education on what one may call the
post-graduate level with special reference to teachers in public schools
did not really lapse. It was picked up in a way that was collaborative,
practical, content- oriented. Indeed, as early as 1970, the History
Department with Howard Lamar and others began a history education project
which assisted a number of Social Studies teachers in New Haven to develop
improved curricula in American history, world area studies, urban studies,
and the success of that program led to the organization of a more
ambitious program that would include other disciplines. In 1978, the
Teachers Institute was established as a joint program of Yale and the New
Haven Public Schools, that is, the schools within the city of New Haven
proper, not the outlying suburbs. By 1980, it was cited by the Rockefeller
Commission on Humanities as a model of University­School
collaboration that integrates curriculum development with intellectual
renewal for teachers, and I've given you some handouts that indicate
further comments by outsiders on up to the present date.
</p><p>
From the very beginning, it's been a collaboration not just between
organizations­Yale and the school system­but among persons. And
from the very beginning, the moving spirit of that collaboration has been
James R. Vivian, the Director of the Institute, without whose vision,
practicality, persistence, and in my opinion at least, organizational
genius, the Institute wouldn't have come into being and wouldn't hardly
have survived to this date. Really, I think that he ought to be giving
this talk instead of me. But Jim's vision has built into the structure of
the Institute and into the process of curriculum development a notion of
collaboration among Yale faculty as leaders of seminars and advisors of
curriculum units, and New Haven teachers who determine what seminars will
be offered and who select their topic of investigation within them. As Jim
himself has stated it in his introduction to a little book of essays that
emerged from the Institute's work in 1983, "Teaching in America  The
Common Ground," four principles, in his view, have continued to guide the
program. First, belief in the fundamental importance of the classroom
teacher, and of teacher-developed materials for effective learning.
Second, the insistence that teachers of students at different levels
should interact as colleagues, addressing the common problems in teaching
their disciplines that means not only middle school and high school
teachers and, more recently in the Institute, elementary school teachers,
but also Yale faculty­the notion of collegiality across the board
with regard to [whole?] effort is very important. Third, the conviction
that any effort to improve teaching must be teacher centered, and,
consequently, dependent, as the Institute understands it, on a group of
so­called "coordinators" who are teachers who meet weekly during the
year with the director and who constitute an essential part of the
program's leadership. And, finally, the Institute has had the certainty
that the university can assist in improving the public schools only if it
makes a significant and long term commitment to do so.
</p><p>
So, the Institute doesn't involve curriculum experts in the usual sense,
it doesn't involve short­term workshops, nor does it involve regular
graduate courses in either methods or content. Trying, I suppose, to make
a virtue of necessity, it takes advantage of the lack of an education
department here to attack problems of teaching by another, more
collaborative route. I've referred to this earlier as post­graduate,
and it is that technically, in the sense that all of the teachers have
their degrees prior to entering upon teaching. I should make it clear, and
perhaps Peter and Robin will speak to this in various ways, that the
actual seminars are not like Yale graduate courses, and one of the reasons
they are not is that each teacher is working on a curriculum unit for use
in a­very largely­inner­city school, and many of the
teachers do not have significant advanced work in the subjects for which
they are now assigned to teach. And you know, as well as I do, the reasons
behind that kind of a situation in a city of this sort. So that an actual
seminar is likely to be a mixture of some kinds of advanced work, some
kinds of fairly introductory work in the content field, a certain amount
of adult education, a certain amount of work that might seem to a Yale
faculty member more on an undergraduate level, and the challenge is to
bring all of this together in a collaborative way.
</p><p>
Each year, there is a process of discussion and application through which
teachers describe topics of interest. Yale faculty members then circulate
seminar proposals related to those topics; the coordinators, after
canvassing other teachers, select which seminars would be offered­
usually about six seminars a year­four in the humanities, two in the
sciences has been a frequent mix.
</p><p>
The seminars are dual in focus. There is emphasis upon general study, or
study in common, common readings for the seminar, and upon individual
development of a curriculum unit within or tangential to a seminar topic.
So there's a balance between academic preparation and practical classroom
application, a balance, I should say, that is understood differently in
different seminars and by different writers of curriculum units. In the
view of the NEH a number of years ago, it was that balance which made the
Institute unique among the projects it has funded.
</p><p>
As I've said, collegiality is important. The New Haven teachers are
"Fellows" of the Institute, not "students," they are full members of the
Yale community for the full year in which they are registered in the
Institute­they're listed in the university directory, they have
parking and library privileges, access to computer and other
resources­and they receive, on successful completion of the program,
an honorarium which, currently, is at $1,000. The seminars themselves run
from March through July; we have a couple of widely spaced preliminary
meetings in March and April, organizational, beginning of research on
topics, and so forth, and then weekly seminar meetings on the common
reading from May through July. I passed out a smaller number of the 1991
brochures­we don't have enough for everyone there and you can see the
kind of schedule that is worked out for each year­it's this little
thing, about one to a row. If there are others of you who are burning to
have one, I have a small number left up here, and you can pick one up
after the session is over.
</p><p>
Those seminars have covered a wide array of topics over the years in the
humanities and in the sciences. Let me cite not a complete list, but
enough of a list to give you the notion of the wide spread of faculty
involvement and subject matter opportunity: John Agnew, in American
Studies, has taught seminars on twentieth-century American culture and
Afro American history; Victor Bers, in Classics, has taught a seminar in
Greek civilization; Kent Bloomer, in Architecture, has taught a couple of
seminars on elements of architecture; Richard Broadhead, Traugott Lawler,
Robert Stepto, Allan Tractenberg, Mary Manly, and I have taught quite a
wide variety of courses in English, American literature, American Studies,
both working with texts and with the process of writing and with drama;
Robert Bertz, in the Law School, has taught a seminar on the courts, the
Congress, and the Constitution; Roberto Gonzalez- Echevarria and Nicholas
Shumway have taught courses in Latin American literature, Latin American
history; Bob Gordon, professor of Geophysics, has taught a seminar on
geology and the industrial history of Connecticut; Howard Lamar, in
History, a seminar on industrial New Haven and the nation in the
Nineteenth Century; Morris Mahoney, professor of Genetics in the Med
School, has taught a seminar on human fetal development; Jules Prown,
professor of History of Art, has taught a number of seminars on material
culture; Margretta Seashore, professor of Genetics and Pediatrics, taught
a seminar last year on genetics; Charles Walker, Professor Emeritus of
Chemical Engineering, has taught a number of seminars on engineering and
science, coal combustion, nuclear fission, technology; Peter Wegener, on
my left, has taught a couple of seminars on aerodynamics; and Bob Wheeler,
in Physics, has taught a seminar on electrical technologies; and Werner
Wolff, in Engineering, a seminar in science and technology; and Robin
Winks, as he will indicate, has taught a range of seminars in the area of
British studies, detective novel, writing history, U.S. National Parks,
and everything else that Robin is expert in.
</p><p>Well, the curriculum units that come out of these seminars have been
even more diverse because each Fellow adapts a unit applicable to her or
his own teaching, but with potential relevance to the teaching of others.
These units are written, not as graduate papers; they are written, as it
were, as first person accounts of a plan to teach a specified kind of unit
in the coming year, and written with the understanding that their primary
audience is composed of the colleagues within the New Haven system. The
units are written in stages over the course of the seminar, with ample
opportunity for feedback, revision, both from the seminar leader and from
colleagues in the seminar. And then they are, each year, done up in a
series of volumes like this which are kept both at the Institute office
and placed in the school libraries within the New Haven system. There are
several ways of giving you a sense of the range and variety of these
units; Peter and Robin and I will all do that to some degree. I might note
that the volume I have in hand which came out of a seminar that I led last
summer, is, at least, an example of one kind of development. The seminar
was actually in contemporary American drama, script and performance, and
it was designed to alert English teachers to the performance dimensions
within scripts, and to alert some theater and dance teachers to some of
the disciplines involved in actually struggling with a text. And yet, of
course, the recent American drama that we were dealing with was
essentially drama on an adult level, which we read, did some rehearsing,
some presentation for our own amazement, and so forth. But these teachers
were, for the most part, middle school and elementary school teachers for
whom those particular plays would not be appropriate, so each was
developing her or his own direction, incorporating, insofar as
appropriate, kinds of things picked up in the seminar. We ended by
retitling the book, then, "Learning through Drama," which was a more
accurate reflection of the variety of units.  It contains such units as
"Recipes for Playmaking," "Improvisational Drama," "Preparation of a Play
to be Performed for a School Audience," "A Study of the Theme of Family in
Plays," "Study of Egyptian Culture through Playwriting and Play
Performance," "Study of the Amistad Affair .... " which people in
Connecticut, at least, know all about, "...through Theater," "A Study of
Certain Aspects of Contemporary Legal Practice" for a ninth grade course
in law through mock trial, theatrical performance, and an elementary unit
called "Melting Pot Theater Teaching for Cultural Understanding," which
was written by someone who is not a single classroom teacher, but visits a
number of schools as drama supervisor, and who worked out sort of a master
plan for inquiry into three cultures, Russia, Ghana, and Puerto Rico, by
elementary school kids each developing aspects of what would come together
as a grandiose performance: aliens from other lands visiting these
cultures and learning about them. So that you can see that the variety is
potentially endless here.
</p><p>
I've recently had the opportunity of reading through the majority, not
all, but the majority of the units that have been prepared over the last
twelve years, prepared by more than three hundred teachers now, some 40%
of them having written two or more such units, so that I have at this
moment a pretty live impression of the actual variety. These units are
widely used; a survey in the spring of '85 showed that they were taught in
more than 1,500 classes, at that point, five years ago, with attendance in
those classes of 30,000 students. One third of all of the New Haven
secondary school teachers, whether or not Fellows, used
Institute-developed units in some way or at some point. Seventy-one
percent of those using those units in or by 1985 used two or more of them.
At this point, 1990 in fact, 40% of all of the middle and high school
teachers of humanities and sciences have completed the Institute
successfully, at least once. And, as I've indicated, the last couple of
years, the Institute has been incorporating elementary school teachers and
finding that they add in very well to the mix, despite the difference in
level of grade taught.
</p><p>
My own review of these units and of seminar leaders' recommendations has
been part of an ongoing preparation of a volume of units as examples of
what the Institute is doing. That's one aspect of the task of
disseminating the idea of the Institute, which has always been one of
James Vivian's major goals. There are, in fact, other books in
preparation, one by a high school English teacher, Jane Marshall, shaped
from her own series of units, each of which becomes, after revision, a
chapter in this book. Both Robin and I have had something to do with that
project. There's another on national parks which comes out of one of
Robin's seminars recently; he may be able to say something about both.
</p><p>
In the volume with which I've been concerned, we identified a substantial
number of units, a really surprisingly large number, about sixty, that
seemed, on the basis of the recommendations of the seminar leaders,
potentially publishable beyond the New Haven system (since, in a sense,
they are all published within the system) as illustrations of curricular
development. We then tried to narrow this down with some kind of field
distribution, invited about thirty people; some of those were not
interested in the process of updating and revision that we thought would
probably be best at this stage of the game. It looks as though we will
have about a dozen units for distribution beyond the New Haven system.
They will include, for example, the one I just mentioned, elementary
school unit, "Melting Pot Theater;" a unit in autobiography which involves
journal writing, study of autobiographies, and study of Hispanic
autobiographical material; a unit on "Learning Your Way Around Fair
Haven," a unit which is really local history, local geography, on the
grounds that the best way to understand; a piece by Jane Marshall, whom I
have mentioned, "American Detectives: On TV and in Books," a piece by a
teacher of Spanish who has within a seminar that Roberto Gonzales
Eschevarria led on Latin America developed a way to present Shakespeare's
<i>Tempest</i> in classes that are devoted to English as a second
language. The main emphasis there, the thematic emphasis, as you can
predict, is Caliban. What are the attitudes of people toward someone who
does not know the language, what problems emerge both for pupil and for
teacher that <i>The Tempest</i> has, in some way, touched upon. Another
teacher, history teacher, has a unit on Supreme Court rules on school
desegregation from <i>Plessy v. Ferguson</i>to <i>Brown v. The Board of
Education of Topeka, Kansas</i>; a math teacher has a unit that is on,
that is really a kind of statistical sampler; another math teacher who was
working with Peter and teaches at the Sound School where they have an
emphasis upon marine activities has developed a unit that incorporates
physics and math with a marine emphasis; another teacher, also working
with Peter, has a unit that incorporates the historical development of the
aircraft industry with mathematical implications spherical geometry, and
so forth; and another teacher has a unit on crystals in the world around
us; and another daring teacher engaged head on the question, "Creation,
Evolution, and the Human Genome." It is a course that he will
teach­he is a biology teacher, essentially. He will teach it with a
humanities teacher in a team teaching way, and it runs down historically
understanding of evolution before Darwin and since, and points up some of
the issues in debating the nature of evolution, and then goes on to the
biological component in which, whatever one's view on those matters,
various evidence with regard to the human genome, and he develops in that
way. It's a very tactful approach, I think, to what his seminar understood
to be a considerable difficulty these days in teaching.
</p><p>
I think we can expect similar diversity to emerge from the seminars being
offered this year. Howard Lamar is leading one in "Multi- Disciplinary
Studies in American Regions and Regionalism," Jules Prown is leading one
in "The Family in Art and Material Culture," Robert Stepto is leading one
in "Afro-American Autobiography," and I'm leading one in "Recent American
Poetry: Expanding the Canon."
</p><p>
I might say a sentence or two about that because it's an instance of what
I think often, though not always, happens in the Institute. The Yale
faculty member may take the seminar topic as an occasion to do some
exploring in an area that is not properly part of her or his specialty,
and it helps to accentuate the collegiality of the experience, and is,
indeed, a lot of fun. I've taught American poetry, but always from a
fairly­what?­Anglo-American standard approach, and so what I
decided we ought to do is to make a survey of recent American poets from
different ethnic and racial backgrounds. This is something that interests
the teachers very much because of the ethnic and racial composition of
their own classes in New Haven, and we're finding, thus far, lots of
interesting things to talk about.
</p><p>
In the sciences this year, Walter Anyan, section chief of Pediatrics at
the Medical School, is leading a seminar in "Adolescents and Adolescents'
Health," which covers quite a variety of topics including pregnancy,
adolescent parenting, sexually transmitted infections, drug abuse, you
know, the whole bit. And Karl Turekian, in Geology and Geophysics, and
director of the Center for the Study of Global Change, is leading a
seminar in "Global Environmental Change," in which he will try to put some
current concerns in the news in a geological context and a historical
context.
</p><p>
Well, before formally introducing my colleagues at this table and letting
them say something about their specific seminars, I do want to add a word
about the potential future for the Institute. For many years, it's been
the goal of the Director, James Vivian, to put the Institute on an
endowment basis to insure its survival beyond the vicissitudes that we all
know of temporary foundation grants. That's been a year to year, three
year hand to-mouth existence for quite some time. Jim has held to that
goal tenaciously, through good times and bad, financially speaking, and it
now begins to look quite realizable, despite the fact that, as you know,
foundations, in contrast to individuals, are often very leery to
contributing to endowment, rather than to specific, local projects. The
goal is a five million dollar endowment and cash reserve which would
provide income, effectively, and perpetuity for the Institute, and would
make it very clearly­it or some substitute for it, if that turned out
at some future date now to be the best way to go about these things to
continue that in that fashion through endowment. As you've seen through
the handouts that you've received, the Institute received a DeWitt
Wallace-Readers Digest Fund challenge grant of two million dollars last
fall. At the moment, I should say, only $145,000 has been received to
match that grant. We've got a long way to go, but there is an application
to NEH for a million dollar challenge grant which would help out
considerably. That grant, I understand from Jim Vivian, is still in the
stage of "being negotiated" with NEH.
</p><p>
As many of you may know, Yale's recent President, the late Bart Giamatti,
was a staunch supporter of education throughout the country, and he was,
indeed, a staunch supporter of the Institute.  That support has been
continued by President Benno Schmidt who stated in the application for the
NEH grant that the Institute, in his view, "demonstrates Yale's long
standing commitment to collaboration between university faculty members
and school teachers as a necessary means of strengthening teaching and
learning of academic subjects. This type of collaboration is essential to
education reform in the United States. We recognize the benefits of the
Institute to New Haven teachers and their students, the New Haven
community generally, and to the nation, and we are confident of the
benefits also to Yale faculty members and to Yale itself as an
institution." I haven't said very much about that myself, but probably
Peter and Robin can. It is clear from Benno Schmidt's letter that the
Institute is now a high priority for Yale. Indeed, this was an application
the application that Yale was permitted to make at this point for NEH
funding which went to the Institute.
</p><p>Well, despite the good news, there is also the continuing anxiety. It
probably goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway: the Institute would
welcome your support, in any fashion, as it searches for this endowment.
</p><p>
Well, let me turn now to my colleagues and say something about their
seminars. Peter Wegener, as you know, is Harold Hodgkins Professor
Emeritus, has a doctorate from the Institute of Oceanography of Berlin
University. He has done research and scholarly activities at Buena Munda,
the U.S. Naval Ordinance Laboratory, and the jet propulsion lab of Cal
Tech, and, more recently, at Yale. He is an internationally recognized
expert on supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels, gas dynamics,
condensation, and chemical kinetics, and he has published very widely in
those fields. He's also, of course, been of great service to Yale as
Chairman of the Department of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and also
as Director of the Division of Physical Science. His seminars have been on
aerodynamics at least, that's been their official title. Peter...
</p><h4><i>Professor Peter Wegener:</i></h4>
<p>
In recent years, for a few years, I've taught a one-term course every year
at Yale in the Physical Sciences, directed to people in the Humanities and
Social Sciences. No equations, or at least, very few.  Maybe addition or
subtraction I'm not kidding, I'm not kidding. I wish I were. At any rate,
it branched out; there were many organizations within the state of
Connecticut where one addresses students or teachers sort of in a one shot
affair, and I drove out the places with some equipment in my truck, etc.,
etc. Then, the Institute asked me, and I gave two seminars­I
shouldn't say "I gave two seminars"­I led two seminars in 1988 and in
1990, and I chose the topic of flight. The reason? I didn't know much
about flight, and I was always wondering, "When you sit in a Boeing 747,
you see all this baggage piled in, you see people come in with enormous
amounts of stuff, and how in the world does this thing take off?" I'm sure
this thought has crossed your minds. I now know. I could tell you, if I
had about an hour.
</p>
<p>
I did not know what to expect, because my son went through high school in
California and also so long ago that it's not an applicable experience.
Therefore, I would like to give you some very pragmatic remarks on what I
ran into, which I thought about in order to be here, today, at this panel.
And these are pure;y practical things, not very philosophical.
The seminar starts after school, 3:15. And the status of some of the
teachers at 3:15 is not necessarily perfect. Therefore, I found it­
that the­listening to an hour and a half of discussions and
presentations by the seminar leader was really a very special effort,
which I regarded very highly. The second point: I became convinced­I
had about twelve, in each case­they were uniformly and universally
dedicated to teaching, to a degree which I would never have been able to
bring off after I heard what is involved in a New Haven High School
System. And they had a serious interest to broaden their knowledge in an
area which most of them would call enrichment of what they teach anyway.
Therefore, the units, to jump up ahead a little bit, could be for two
weeks, for a whole term, or whatever. There was a remarkable diversity of
topics that were finally chosen for the units. And you heard some examples
here, they were extremely broad, also in my case, they ranged from purely
historical material to two or three which were indeed sort of approaching
the idea of science.
</p><p>
A very remarkable thing that I observed, which I had not anticipated at
all, there was a great deal of social interaction among the teachers.
Therefore, they began to talk to each other in the seminar which I
encouraged, not necessarily at all about the subject of aerodynamics, but
about experiences they had. "What do I do if this happens?" "How did you
handle this?" And many of them come from different schools. And it turns
out, which I found surprising, that during the school day, they cannot
talk to each other. There is simply no time, no place to sit down and have
a cup of coffee or something, which I had certainly not known. Now, having
said all this, I have to turn to the subject matter that these teachers
are supposed to get across to their students.
</p><p>
I had thought, innocently, and my talks at schools and to teachers had not
changed that at all, prior to may seminar experience, I had thought that a
science teacher did take a course at Southern Connecticut­this is
where most of them come from­in science of some sort­physics
course, chemistry course, before you teach physics or chemistry. It turns
out that in nearly all cases this was simply not true. I understand it's a
little better in the biological areas which I'm not familiar with. I did
find in every case in two seminars, three or four teachers who had,
indeed, a background in mathematics, and could, indeed, teach algebra or
whatever topic might be involved. And the science end was used, in many
cases, to find practical examples in order to make the mathematics a
little more palatable. Now, many of the teachers, I found, and some
started their units saying, "Two years ago, I was assigned to teaching
science." Then you ask, "Now, what did you do before that?" Well, they
taught some social thing, or they taught history, or they taught, maybe,
English. And it would seem to me that if you talk about the so called
"hard sciences," which I'm trying to do, in real contrast to the
humanities, which I'm sure can be done with the kind of education, I hope,
that they do receive, again, at Southern, which is now called
"University­Southern Connecticut University." But, to get across the
simplest elementary mechanics, like running a ball down an inclined plane,
or what is free fall, or the kind of thing which you must know if you read
<i>The New York Times, </i>and if you want to have any understanding of
any of this, is in many cases simply not there.  Now, therefore, I ended
up with aerodynamics, the perfect field for this, to teach mechanics, to
teach something about the atmosphere in which we live, or how is it high
up, etc., why can't you really breathe on Mount Everest, things of this
sort. But for a person who encounters at Yale among our graduate students,
seventy-five percent from other countries, and at MIT this number is
higher, this is a puzzling and saddening statement.
</p><p>Totally disconnected, I want to say something about Yale undergraduates
in Engineering and Applied Science. In the last two weeks, there was a
yearly contest at MIT. A two pronged approach.  A student team goes up
from many universities and they solve problems design problems, and other
problems which are given to them. And then they have to participate in an
athletic event. The Yale team, for the first time in years, beat MIT's
team in problem solving. They had to do many complicated problems, which
they did, and they beat 'em, playing volleyball...[obscured by laughter].
This was unique, this was really unique [?] from this engineering honor
society.
</p><p>
At any rate, therefore, the Institute seminars in science cannot possibly
remedy what I just said last. On the other hand, of course, you can point
to books, open some avenues, maybe, and certainly two of the people who
took the seminar, two of the Fellows are now in the list that Tom
mentioned. And one is a partially descriptive, but then, leading into
spherical geometry case, and the other one from the Sound School talks,
quite seriously, about modeling. If you have a little boat, how can you
then do experiments on a little boat and turn it over to the Queen Mary.
Therefore, I think the overall effect can only be very good from including
reasons which are really outside the actual material that is taught in the
seminars to keep people more alive and more interested in new subjects.
Thank you.

Thank you, Peter.

Robin Winks, Ralph W. Thompson Professor of History, has also been central
to the Yale enterprise for many years. He is, of course, an authority on
commonwealth history throughout the world, post- commonwealth history as
well. He served as Master of Berkeley College until very recently; he
served the U.S. government in its relations to Britain and in its
supervision of the National Parks system. Indeed, Robin's books suggest
something of the breadth of his interests. Some of them are: <i>Canada and
the U.S.­The Civil War Years, The Blacks in Canada, The Cold War:
Yalta to Cuba, ­The Historian as Detective, Cloak and Gown: Scholars

<p>
Thank you very much.
</p><p>
I want to touch on a few practical aspects of the seminars that have not
been directly touched upon before, but also, as Peter did, tell you some
of the problems and tell you my own approach and the satisfactions I
gained from teaching such a program. I might start with the last.
When I first came to Yale, joining the faculty 1957, there was a program
called "Carnegie Studies for Engineers." And I, in effect, did the reverse
to what Peter has been doing. That is, I carried the humanities to the
unenlightened by making it possible for engineers to understand the flow
of historical events, themselves without ever having to memorize a date. I
enjoyed this enormously, and was then drawn into the M.A.T. program, as
some of you know, because there are some old friends here, and then, in
due course, into the Yale-New Haven Institute. Because as a teacher, and
equally as much as a researcher and writer, my primary concern is with
communication and with narrowing the limits of tunnel vision in a way by
which one can break out and speak from discipline to discipline.
Therefore, each of the seminars I have created for the Institute have
attempted to do the same. They are, in one sense, narrow, and in another
sense, their application is intended to be very broad. I've lost track of
how many, in fact, I've taught. I counted up seven in my mind, and then
decided not to try to go further. And they have been across a fairly wide
range of subjects, though the commonality in each of them was this desire
both myself to communicate and to learn from the teachers what the
realities of the classroom are today, and at the same time, to persuade
teachers that they need not limit themselves to their own discipline when
teaching.
</p><p>
Two good examples of this would rise from, first, a seminar I taught some
years ago on the exercise of American world power, which grew out of my
own professional interest and undergraduate teaching at Yale on the
history of comparative imperialisms in which two of the Fellows of the
seminar taught what I used to call, growing up and going to high school in
Colorado, "shop," but which I now understand is called "industrial
mechanics," or something else of that sort. These two Fellows, I think
it's reasonable to say, did not spend a great seal of their time reading
books about the growth of American world power. What they were most
interested in doing as a project was to build, completely from scratch, a
full­not a replica, not a miniature replica­a full cannon of the
period of the 19th Century European wars, showing their students all of
the metallurgy, all of the rifling, all of the science that was involved
in doing so, and then take it into the field and fire it. The unit that
they produced, I thought, was excellent because it was about one aspect of
the exercise of power, which is arms, and, in the process of that, they
learned, I think, a great deal about what this artifact they were
constructing meant, especially to Third World peoples when it was employed
against them in the great imperial wars of the 19th century, and I think
they conveyed a good bit of that to their students. I, too, learned a
great deal, particularly when I stood a little too close to the cannon
when it was tested and fired.
</p><p>
Just last year, because what of my great interests is the U.S. National
Parks System, I offered a seminar on national parks. There are, as I'm
sure most of you are not aware, 367 national parks in the United States.
Most Americans are hard-pressed to name more than ten, and after they have
gotten past the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, and Yellowstone, they begin to be
fairly desperate, focus in upon some local units, and then are done. It's
the largest, it's certainly the finest, and it's the most intellectually
articulated system of national commemorative reserves of any country in
the world. And through a study of it, one can learn a great deal about
what the American people take pride in, since, to actually preserve an
area, whether it's natural or historical, is a political act. I invited
applicants from all of the possible disciplines, and I had a teacher of
the Earth Sciences who worked out, I thought, a quite beautiful unit on
how to teach geology from Glacier National Park and from the general
emphasis upon the preservation of certain geological phenomena within the
parks. I had history teachers, for whom the task was relatively easy, and
other science teachers, and literature teachers, but the most exciting was
a teacher of music. There is no unit of the National Parks System
dedicated to the commemoration of American music, though there is intended
to be, in due course, and this year being the seventy-fifth anniversary of
the National Parks Service, the Service is professionally studying the
question of how it could commemorate the issue of a distinctive American
sound. And, as you can imagine, there has been emphasis upon American
jazz, there has been emphasis upon distinguished composers, there has been
emphasis upon Ives and Copland, etc. And this music teacher did a
wonderful unit on John Philip Sousa, and how the marching band was the
distinctive, universal, American sound. And when I sent this, in fact, to
the National Parks Service, they were so pleased with it that it's very
likely that one unit to American music will be John Philip Sousa's house 
on Long Island.
</p><p>
So that my concern throughout was to draw teachers in who did not see the
relevance of the subject that I was trying to entice them into.  That's to
say that, as Peter spelled out what he thought were the disadvantages of
the teachers, I felt, I detected, two that were predominant above all
others. They did not include serious [under? other? ?] preparation for the
subjects being taught, because somehow it is always assumed that anybody
could teach history or English, though in fact, of course, as a
professional historian, I think it has fully as arcane, occult, and
difficult methodology as any other academic discipline. But I remembered
in high school, after all, all of my history was taught to me by the track
and football coaches. All of my mathematics was taught by a person who
spent most of the class attempting to sell through me, to my parents,
insurance. To be sure, he used mathematical formulae and actuarial tables
to tell me why I needed to carry certain messages back to my parents. And
my Spanish was taught by a person [?] whom I later learned it [for?] "New
New Spanish." So I had come slowly to a realization of that somewhere
midway through the year when I attempted to use pronunciation she had
taught me on a short trip to Mexico and found it didn't work.
</p><p>
Teachers are frequently under-prepared, and that includes University
teachers. But I felt that the greater problems were that the teachers
arrived, not only tired, but dispirited. Things had happened during the
day that led them not to take great pride, necessarily, in being a
teacher. And every one of my seminars has been aimed at the assumption
that it's necessary to broaden the base by which the teacher can come to
understand what they are doing is the most important thing in the world.
Now, I have to confess, I think I am doing the most important thing in the
world. And I believe everybody should believe that they're doing the most
important thing in the world, and if they don't believe it, they should
get out of it and do something else. Otherwise, there will be dispirited
days piled upon dispirited days. So I don't mean that my seminars are
meant to be evangelical as such, but they were meant quite consciously to
suggest to teachers how important what they were doing was, and how, if
they were a little tired of fighting the Civil War in their American
History course, for the twenty-second consecutive time, how they might
enliven it, but more importantly, enliven themselves, by perhaps adding a
different dimension. The dimension of historical fiction that is written
about the Civil War, the dimension of comparative civil wars in other
societies so that they could see that the American Civil War while, as
with all historical events if looked at closely enough, is unique, is, if
one draws back from it enough, is comparative to other nations that have
faced potential breakdown. How they could mix in, in other words, other
materials.
</p><p>
The most successful seminars that I taught, I think both from my own
perspective and the teachers' perspectives, have been the three occasions
at which I taught seminars on what some would think of as my hobby, though
I don't think of it in that way, and that is to say, mystery, detective,
and espionage fiction. Since I do believe, very strongly, that the
methodology of the historian is to teach people to ask good questions,
that that is the primary conveyance to the students, I'm afraid I'm one of
those people who thinks that it does not matter in the least whether
students, or, indeed, teachers can name every president of the United
States in succession, it does not matter in the least whether one can name
the central tariffs, though it is wise not to play that you know them if
you don't, and there surely is a certain act of memory that does go at a
low level with getting the basic facts out in history, that we could use
detective fiction to show how the methodology of the historian in posing
the questions, looking for anomalies, asking whether the right question
has been, in fact, posed, when finding it hasn't, shifting the question,
could be very valuable to the student and to the teacher. And those have
proved great fun. Great fun for me because I learned a great deal, which
brings me back to where I began, why does one teach in these seminars.
</p><p>Well, in part, because, as I mentioned, I started in Carnegie Studies
for Engineers and M.A.T., in part, perhaps, because my father was a high
school superintendent and my mother was a junior high school principal,
which is to say, I observed teaching and the realities of public education
at home, perhaps, in part, because my daughter went to Hamden High School,
but I don't think one plays out one's autobiography, finally, in career
choices, necessarily. Much more because they're great fun, and because one
learns about the realities of the classroom from which over fifty percent
of the Yale students one is later going to teach are coming. So that as a
teacher one does not improperly lionize, heroize, or place expectations
even on the Yale student because one comes to realize that today it's
quite easy to get through high school without ever having read a word of
Chaucer. Indeed, it's quite easy to get through Yale without ever having
read a word of Chaucer. And that it's quite easy to get through high
school without ever having taken a course that I would necessarily label
"history."
</p><p>
In addition, I find it a very effective way to help the teachers fight
against localism. I quite agree with what Tom Whitaker said, that history
begins at the schoolroom door; indeed, I think it also begins inside the
schoolroom. But it mustn't be limited to presumptions that are purely
local. That is to say, I think it unfortunate if either teachers or
students come to the assumption that the normative process is that which
occurs in their home town because it is never the normative process. When
I first came east from Colorado, I went to Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and
concluded that the upper south was a very peculiar part of the world,
indeed. I then came to Yale to teach and concluded that New England was an
even more peculiar part of the world. Now, when I return to Colorado, I
realize that it has its own distinct peculiarities, and that teachers who
teach to the assumption that these are normative environments are doing a
disservice to students in so highly a mobile population as our own.  So
that as a teacher would produce a unit, let us say, that would focus upon
a New Haven manifestation, which is understandable, since all the teachers
come from New Haven, the New Haven manifestation of a historical issue, I
pressed them very hard to say, "How would a teacher in Billings, Montana,
use that unit?" The teachers who say, "Oh, I know where Billings is," are
the ones I like most. The ones who say, "Where's Montana?" are the ones
who worry me. But I do work closely with them, so that I think in the end
result, in fact, the units can be used. Which is to say, there needs to
be, certainly in the humanities, at least­this follows automatically
in the sciences, because the law of gravity, I believe, is the same in
Billings as in New Haven­but in the humanities, it is necessary often
to press teacher and student to begin at the schoolroom door, but to move
comparatively beyond that into a far wider involvement.
</p><p>
My most recent experience with the program has been, as Tom was pointing
out, working with one of the senior teachers, who's in fact, I think,
taken seven seminars, and who by that point had fulfilled the needs, as it
were, that I think she felt through the seminar process, and was moved on
to what might be called a master-teacher relationship to the program and
to ourselves to work through the best of her units and produce an actual
book which is about British culture, since British history is now very
seldom taught, of course, in the New Haven schools­how to use British
novels, including detective fiction, and British films, to convey
universals about the issue of fiction, reading, writing, and finally film
itself.
</p><p>
I'll close on just one other point. The Fellows truly are equals. This is
not a game. I learn as much from the Fellows­not, perhaps, about the
discipline we're engaged in, but sometimes then, too­that fully as
much from the Fellows as I give and they learn also from each other. There
are, in that learning process, small additional dividends.  Tom did not
mention the deadlines. There are quite firm deadlines for submission of
first draft, submission of prospectus, submission of first draft,
submission of second draft, and completion of unit. Each of the teachers
is expected to meet with the person running the seminar twice, minimally,
to a schedule that is not very flexible.  Since I happen to believe very
firmly in deadlines, and, indeed, even in publish or perish, I think it's
important to get words down on paper because I don't think people know
what it is that they think until they have had to find the words by which
they convey it to someone other than themselves. And up until that is
achieved, the thinking is not clear, however clear the thinker believes it
to be.  And it must be done to a deadline. And I find that this
enforcement of deadlines, insisting on clarity of expression that goes
beyond, sometimes, the vocabulary the teacher would normatively use vis a
vis their own students is a very important aspect of the interactive
process in these seminars. As is, finally, the fact that all those who are
teaching seminars in a given year, in a given summer, or starting in
March, get together, periodically, for lunch. So that I can hear about
Peter's problems in his seminars, and he can hear about my problems in my
seminars, though usually, to irritate Peter, I always said, "Well, there
are no problems in my seminars at all." Which is to say, there is also a
great deal of fun, of course, interchanging with other Yale faculty in an
understanding of how their disciplines are conveyed or not conveyed, and
are taught in the school systems of New Haven.
</p><h4><i>Professor Whitaker:</i></h4>
<p>
We've covered quite a variety of topics; there are, no doubt, many more we
have not covered. Perhaps you can ferret them out for us with some sharp
questions. Yes, in the very back.
</p>
<h4><i>Question I</i></h4>
<p>
When I was in New Haven, I followed with great interest the growth of the
Teacher Institute, and one of the wonderful things about it which is also
a sad commentary is that it provided a unique chance for dialogue among
teachers about the kinds of things they were teaching and the problems
that they were having. One of the laments that a number of us had about it
is that the Institute never included teachers from the local independent
schools. Now, I am working in Philadelphia where there is a program that
modeled itself on the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute called "PATHS,"
which does provide seminars for both public and private school teachers
who come together, I think for the benefit of everyone. I wonder if that
is at all under consideration at this point.
</p>
<h4><i>Professor Whitaker responds:</i></h4>
<p>
You don't have anyone here who can give the authoritative answer to that.
I can say that there has been­what?­recurrent discussion at
least among faculty with regard to both private schools and schools just
beyond the city limits of New Haven which limits are, of course,
now­what?­lines of demarcation right through urban areas. The
position, at least as long as I've had any connection with the Institute,
has been officially that it was important for Yale to cooperate with the
city of New Haven, to use its resources in a focused and visible way
there, and that there would simply be a kind of dissipation of effort if
it were made too broad. So far as I know, that's not a position that is
settled forever. You know, these things are always discussed, and it might
well be that at some point down the road, especially if there is firm
financial footing for the Institute, it might look toward other systems,
toward other areas of the state, toward private schools for various kinds
of cooperation. I don't know whether you know anything more than that,
Peter or Robin?
</p>
<h4><i>Question 2</i></h4>
<p>
I have both a comment and a question. My comment is that I have the
impression that the Institute was conceptualized primarily in terms of
secondary school teachers, and that you have found some advantage in
having elementary school teachers as part of this endeavor. I would think
that in terms of the seething of enthusiasm and scholarly attitudes, you
will get more bang for your dollar by focusing more on the elementary
school teachers for two reasons.  First of all, the elementary school
teachers have more leeway in their schedule to make this happen and are
more likely to have other kinds of projects that develop after they have
gotten a taste of this.  And also, from the student point of view, the
enthusiasm for finding out which by the adolescent level has diminished
for some, partly because it's been squelched, partly because sexual
matters are now sort of important­nothing else counts. So I think
that middle grades­upper elementary school grades­are the most
exciting intellectual time for the future actions toward learning. So in
that sense, my comment is, I would hope that the elementary school teacher
input would be increased.
</p><p>
The question part is, I'm assuming you have a limited number of openings
in the program. How do you select people, or how do they self­select?
</p><h4><i>Professor Whitaker:</i></h4>
<p>
Anybody want to answer? All right, let me simply agree with the drift of
your comments. Certainly, in my own experience in the last couple of
years, I have found some of the most exciting interdisciplinary thinking
on the part of elementary school teachers who are forced to construct a
day of interdisciplinary thinking in their own classroom. And indeed, some
of the high school teachers, in my experience, have been a little
difficult to get out of curricula as they were formulated for certain high
school courses. So that I understand the point.
</p><p>
With regard to applications, my understanding is that up until the last
year or so, there has never been any need to draw the line. Any
application, in order to be accepted, must state in a preliminary way a
topic that bears upon the seminar offered, and permission from the
teacher's supervisor must be included, so that the teacher can, without
question, teach that unit that is to be prepared in the following year.
Now, those hurdles somewhat reduce the applications, but it has been
possible, I gather, to proceed without limitations other than bureaucratic
ones of that sort until the last couple of years, when, indeed, the effort
has been made to increase in the area of elementary schools. And last
year, my understanding is, that finally the decisions were made more or
less by lot. That is, there has been, in the Institute on the level of
admissions, as well as on the level of final completion, a steady
reluctance to make invidious judgments of quality, to say that this should
be an opportunity open to teachers across the board, and that nothing
should interfere with the collegiality. I happen to have in my seminar
this spring a couple of people who applied for my drama seminar last year
and were not admitted simply because the coin flipped the wrong way.
</p><p>
Yes.
</p><h4><i>Question 3</i></h4>
<p>
I have a hope and a question. The hope is that there is evidence among the
students who have been taught by the teachers in this program of better
achievement, better performance measured or computed in any way. [Garbled]
measure in fact the students? What has it shown?
</p>
<h4><i>Professor Whitaker responds:</i></h4>
<p>
Have you been involved in that, Robin?
</p><p>
Again, I'm not the person to give you the proper answers to that.  The
Institute has been concerned, at least since 1985, to work out means of
demonstrating its effectiveness. Those means, at least thus far, I think,
have not been in terms of the kinds of checklists of skills that one
frequently finds in high school, but in terms of testimony from teachers,
their experiences, their experiences of using other units, and so forth.
Partly, that's a function of the fact that the units are often units of
enrichment or interdisciplinary units, not directed as a major effort
toward basic skills in this course, although they very often include a
basic skills component built in to the unit.  There is, if I recall
correctly, a certain amount of evidence that a major positive effect has
been increasing morale among New Haven teachers, at least on their own
account. There are teachers who, in accord with the kind of thing that
Robin was saying, have found their work with the Institute one of the
things that has helped to keep them plugging at it over the last few
years. That is probably an area that ought to be looked at in some way,
though, given the diversity of the units, it is, in my view, an
extraordinarily difficult question to deal with.
</p><h4><i>Professor Winks responds:</i></h4>
<p>
Can I just comment on that too? Having thought I had nothing to say, and
certainly having nothing particularly helpful, but I still want to
comment. I don't know how you would study it. I really don't know how you
would design a study to see what the impact is, because the students move
through so rapidly. And so, in some instances, do the teachers. The
evidence is, therefore, all anecdotal and subjective.  The teachers
themselves who come back and are repeaters and, let us say, take my
seminar on world power and the next time take one on detective fiction and
then, perhaps, the next time take national parks, themselves say, "That
unit I did last time was marvelous and helped a great deal in the
classroom." Those of us who teach are also invited, on occasion, not as
often as I think some of us would like, to come and actually speak to the
class in which the unit is being used.  Often near the end. I have done
this three times over the years. I guess I feel it should have been at
least seven times, that is to say, one ... [tape ends, other side begins a
bit later'...themselves, and that they're still teaching, etc., so it's
understandable, and I find on those occasions the students, quite bright,
[?] of the material. But whether they were especially prepped for the
presence of a visitor, of course, I have no way of knowing.
</p><p>
And thirdly, Tom remarked upon how the teachers are selected, but he
didn't remark on how faculty come forward and then their seminars are
selected, and it's in a process which, when Jim Vivian would circulate
faculty, not just those who'd done this before, and say, "Would you be
interested in teaching," and you'd have to say, "Well, no, not in the
summer of '91, I'm on leave of absence," or what have you, "but I'll be
interested in '92," he then asks you to submit three or four seminar
ideas. And the teachers themselves meet and declare which of those ideas
they would find most useful to them in their own future teaching. You then
work up a more detailed syllabus for the seminar. So the seminar is not
just imposed on the teacher, where they say, "Well, this is it. If you
want national parks, that's what you better take," because they're offered
three or four.  And in the selections that the teachers themselves make, I
think one can, again, get some kind of subjective sense of where they feel
the necessary impact in their teaching is going to go, where it might be
most effective to them. 'Cause I think they really make the decision on
professional grounds, not on what they think would entertain them for the
summer. But otherwise, I don't know how one would measure this at all.
</p><h4><i>Professor Whitaker responds again:</i></h4>
<p>
Just another bit of anecdotal evidence that occurs to me... Robin and I
have been talking about the teacher who has done a series on British
culture. As I've been working with teachers revising their units this
winter, I've come across a number of others for whom a given unit was, at
least, an important stage in their own intellectual development. It's a
question, of course, of how you translate this into students. The woman
who's working on Supreme Court rules on school desegregation, for example,
who is a history teacher, found that that unit which she did with Robert
Cover encouraged her to think about the field of legal decisions and legal
writing as something that should become central to her teaching of history
in high school.  And she has made use of that subject matter in a variety
of ways since producing that unit. Similarly, the young man who was
working on autobiography has been making a kind of intellectual tour
through varieties of autobiography from student journals to central texts,
and now, most recently, to Hispanic, and is gradually putting together in
his mind a much more complete understanding of the problems and issues and
importance of autobiography for our culture than he had at the outset.
It's hard for me to imagine that that can't have some kind of beneficial
effect for the students.
</p><p>
Yes.
</p><h4><i>Question 4</i></h4>
<p>
One of my concerns is slow decline of music education in this country. And
I wonder what, if anything, you are doing to coordinate with the music
school? I was very fortunate to be a guinea pig in the M.A.T. music
program­they had not done that before­and feel the role of a
music teacher in this country needs­ it's no longer an individual in
a studio [?] teaching an instrument. It has to be broad musical awareness.
And I wonder what is being done in that direction.
</p>
<h4><i>Professor Whitaker responds:</i></h4>
<p>
I have to keep saying, "I don't know." That is, I do not know what
negotiations or attempted negotiations James Vivian may have had with the
people in the music school. I can make one confession which is that at one
point I was approached by Jim and asked if I would lead a seminar in the
American musical theater. My first response was to try to scurry to find
other people who would do it who would be better qualified. We had some
discussions with the Dean of the Drama School, and so forth. I ended up
doing it; there were in the group music teachers, English teachers, dance
teachers; some of them were working collaboratively at a magnet arts
school.  And I tried to preserve some semblance of professional integrity
by confining myself primarily to the question of how certain American
musicals were, indeed, adapted from previous works of fiction or plays. So
we read Edna Furber, so forth, down the line, and studied the process of
translation in class to the musical medium.
</p><p>
So it was, for me, to a large extent though not entirely, a literary
rather than a musical concern. But, we made certainly full use of the
musical talents of the persons who were there. It's a very interesting
question, I think, points to an area that in my view, along with the area
of visual arts, has been, in some ways, sadly neglected in our official
definitions of the curriculum. I happen to be the kind of person who would
like to put the arts right at the very center of the curriculum and say
that there is the holistic educational medium.  But Jim Vivian should
think more about that. Thank you.
</p><h4><i>Question 5</i></h4>
<p>
It is interesting to hear that you've reached, and impressive that you
reached, as many as forty percent of the teachers. At the same time, you
talked about some people who take more than one seminar.  Would you tell
us a little more about those who are not doing it.  Why are they not doing
it?
</p>
<h4><i>Professor Winks responds:</i></h4>
<p>
None of us are expert on this­Tom's line to start with. One can only
guess. This gives me a chance to bootleg two remarks. I agree with
Virginia Wilkinson, and always have, on what the members of the advisory
committee who have argued that the program should be extended to the
private schools, and, indeed, to suburban schools.  Since my daughter went
to Hamden High School, I've felt she might have benefited from this kind
of program as well, and I certainly agree with the observation about
reaching out far more to the grade school teachers. And I think that's a
part of the answer. That is to say, there is a relatively small pool when
you limit yourself to the New Haven schools, and until recently, that pool
was further limited, of course, if you're assuming that it's high school
or junior high school teachers that you want. I think that explains the
repetition, the number of people who have taken two, three, four seminars
more than it explains, of course, those who haven't.
</p><p>
And many of us go into the schools­I think it's probably, in fact,
Jim's equivalent of an attempt at a kind of salesmanship­about this
time of year, he often arranges some lectures in the schools in which one
goes in and gives a lecture. I will give a lecture on America's rise to
world power, or on answering questions through detective fiction. And one
suspects that that is in part to sell oneself and make known this seminar
will exist, though that is never made explicit.  And I get no sense of why
a third of the smiling faces that laugh at all the right points apply, and
two thirds of the faces that smile equally well and laugh at all the right
points don't. I get no sense of it. And I don't know whether there's been
a study made. But I quite agree with you. I'd like to see some means
provided that's not coercive that would invariably draw in new people
rather than repeats.
</p><h4><i>Professor Whitaker:</i></h4>
<p>
Yes.
</p>
<h4><i>Question 6</i></h4>
<p>
What are some of the themes that the teachers write about that are the
subjects of the seminars, and, second question, do these curricula repeat
themselves year after year, or is it by the year, or do you have a
curriculum [the first pair talks to another group another year?]? Just
those two questions.
</p>
<h4><i>Professor Whitaker responds:</i></h4>
<p>
The answer to the first question, in a way, can be fairly simple.  What is
suggested is the kind of array that I was giving you of actual seminars in
quite a variety of fields. There may be some slightly different topics
that have been suggested for which there was no available faculty member.
By and large, courses are not­or seminars are not­repeated in
any strict way in the way they might in an ordinary school system or in
the Yale curriculum. It is the case, as you know, that Peter has taught
two seminars or led two seminars in aerodynamics. They were, in certain
respects, different. There were, I think, certain repeaters among the
Fellows in that group. I have taught, for example, a number of seminars on
drama. They've been differently organized ... 
</p>
<h4><i>The person who asked question 6 interjects:</i></h4>
<p>
No, no, I mean when these get taught in high school, how many times is the
same curriculum the teacher prepares taught out?
</p>
<h4><i>:Professor Whitaker responds:</i></h4>

I wouldn't know how to give you statistics on that. Individual teachers
have said that they have made their unit a continuing part of their
teaching, though they also have said that they have subjected it to
considerable revision, selection, combination with other things. It
becomes a part of the palette of teaching, as it were, for an individual
student, for an individual teacher at that level.  There's a good deal of
evidence that most of these units­at least more than fifty
percent­remain operative, as it were, and are not just tried once and
then dropped. But one couldn't say that they are simply repeated verbatim
as units.

If I could just comment on that. Virtually all the teachers I've had do
remark to me when I see them again, whether a repeater in a subsequent
seminar, or I simply see them socially, or at the supermarket, that
they've had to revise their unit after the first time they taught
it­substantially­but that certainly more than the kernel of the
unit has remained a permanent part of their teaching thereafter, so long
as that is what they're teaching, and they haven't been reassigned to
something else. And in that sense, I think there's a high degree of
permanence within these units. But the real permanence arises, I think, in
an altered attitude, to go back to national parks. One aspect of that
seminar was to show teachers how they could do a field trip. Out to a
national landmark, of which there are eleven right in the city of New
Haven. These are not run by the National Parks Service, but they are
designated as of national significance by the National Park Service. Or I
could go to Weir Farm in Fairfield county which is very shortly to become
Connecticut's first unit of the National Parks Service, and I suspect that
for a very long time, all of those teachers will now include national park
oriented field trips in their courses, but by no means necessarily to the
same place that was built into their particular curriculum unit.

We won't attempt what Edie MacMullen calls "closure," but simply leave
things open at this point for possible future conversations.
