<h4>James Vivian (director, Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute):</h4>
<p>Thank you. I welcome the opportunity this morning because it seems to
me there is great value in the challenge of digesting, reflecting, and
commenting on a week as richly informative as this one. I want to
concentrate on three things. First, I would like to bring some historical
perspective into consideration by reflecting on how far we have come, on
at least a few topics, since the Yale meeting in 1983. Second, I will
comment on the central issues two and one-half years ago when we met
there. Finally, I will talk briefly about one topic that received an
emphasis in 1983 that it has not received here. It is a topic that we
should continue to stress when we talk about collaboration.
</p><p>The 1981 Colorado Springs meeting, which I did not attend, appears to
have been an historic breakthrough in direct communications between
leaders of schools, colleges, and universities from across the nation. The
continuation of that dialogue has had considerable practical value in
establishing programs and initiatives, and in eroding some of the
mythology on both sides that still, at times, impedes our work and
obscures the profound relatedness of all the individual institutions in
our educational enterprise. In fact, at the 1983 meeting a number of the
participants remarked on the notable absence of that kind of mythology in
our discussions. The purpose of that meeting, as many of you will recall,
was to draw national attention to the role that colleges and universities
can and must play in strengthening teaching in the nation s public
schools. I would note that that was our agenda before the rising tide of
reports and studies issued beginning shortly after we met in New Haven.
</p><p>I would note also that in 1983 it was not immediately obvious that we
would focus on teachers. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching had commissioned Gene Maeroff, education editor for the New York
Times, to prepare a special report surveying collaborative experiments
underway across the country.  Gene discovered and categorized a wide
variety of programs. In his report the section on teaching is, however, a
short one, and he noted there that the small number of collaborative
programs across the country that addressed teaching was truly a "sad
commentary" on where the partnership movement stood.
</p><p>In 1982 the committee of chiefs that helped in planning the Yale
meeting, especially Gordon [Ambach], urged that we concentrate on the view
that we at Yale shared, the view that teaching is central to the
educational process. That teaching has continued to be the focus for much
of the Mellon Project and for this institute strikes me as significant.
This is a signal of our priorities that we sent out from the Yale
conference and will send out from this institute.
</p><p>The 1983 conference concentrated on practice, on case studies of
collaborative programs underway across the country, and on dialogue among
the chiefs, presidents, and chancellors who were attending. Four recurring
themes in their discussions were the issues of prestige, power, pay, and
preparation for school teachers. There was general agreement among the
parties present in 1983 that they might best work together on the
preparation of teachers and thereby on the status of the profession There
was a concern throughout the conference about attracting, preparing, and
retaining the best possible teachers, while at the same time fostering the
morale, rewards, and further preparation of individuals already in the
profession. Barbara Newell said at that time that we must make sure that
all in the education profession share in the rapidly changing fields of
human knowledge, and that collaborative programs must therefore be far
broader than the schools of education and must involve the entire
university community.
</p><p>At the Yale meeting there was a realistic understanding that
collaboration is no panacea in public education, but that it can assist
teachers in specific ways. There was also an evident concern that the
effective practices presented there be applied more widely and
systematically. So we ended with a conviction, as Craig Phillips stated,
that the real model that had been presented was the model of collaboration
itself that it can be done. But I would also recall Craig s comment on the
concluding panel about the massiveness of the undertaking, considering
that there are more than 80,000 public schools in this country.
</p><p>There is not time this morning to talk about all of the issues from the
1983 meeting as they have been reflected in the discussions here. I begin
with an observation about what strikes me as the most sobering message to
come out of this meeting. Speaker after speaker has referred to the
necessity of radical action if we are to bring about meaningful change in
teaching. Judy Lanier, [Dean, College of Education, Michigan State
University] spoke of the enduring traditions of the profession as
"dysfunctional." Frank Newman [President, Education Commission of the
States] spoke of this as a favorable time for radical action and coached
us on some techniques and approaches. Albert Shanker [President, American
Federation of Teachers] proposed major structural changes in the teaching
profession. Mike Timpane [President, Teachers College, Columbia
University] spoke of re-thinking the profession as "a root and branch
operation." Now, if I had been a journalist at this meeting, I would leave
noticed that speakers repeatedly used that kind of language.
</p><p>I mention, then, only two topics in relation to our discussion in 1983;
first, the idea of what, in fact, the teaching profession is.  In 1983 we
spoke, on the one hand, of the negative consequences that have resulted
from the stratification or horizontal divisions in teaching, and, on the
other hand, of the benefits of colleagueship among English, or science, or
mathematics, or other types of teachers without respect to the age of
their students. So, in thinking about collaboration and the reform or
radical action needed to reconstruct the teaching profession in this
country, it is, in my view, essential that we conceive of the profession
as a whole, embracing the entire education community.
</p><p>Second, with respect to the preparation of teachers, the emphasis here
has been on preservice education and the first years of teaching As we
began on Monday, Gordon Ambach listed five factors important in
strengthening the practice of teaching. The fifth, which he termed "the
continuing opportunity to learn," was stressed in 1983, but has received
less attention here. So I would like this morning quickly to pull together
some of the threads of the discussion throughout the week that relate to
that point. We have heard, for instance, about the problems of retention:
that individuals who remain in teaching are disproportionately from the
lower quintiles; that there is little correlation between length of
experience in teaching and effectiveness in the classroom; that lack of
intellectual stimulation, collegial relationships, and serious discourse
with adults marks the profession; that the recency of the teacher's own
learning is an important factor in student learning; and that teachers are
the largest white-collar group in need of continuing education at a time
when lifelong learning has become a reality in our society.
</p><p>To those points I would add another nationwide, a high percentage of
teachers have minimal formal preparation in their subjects. Let me
illustrate by referring to the New Haven public schools. In that school
system fewer than sixty percent of secondary teachers in the humanities
and only about one-third of those in mathematics and science majored in
college or graduate school in the subject they are currently teaching.
Moreover, because scholarship in these fields is constantly changing, even
if a high proportion of teachers had majored in the subjects they teach,
they would still need to stay abreast of the new developments in their
fields.
</p><p>The present state of teacher preparation in the humanities and sciences
will not be readily improved as a result of new teachers entering the
profession. Nationwide, in the latest year for which these statistics are
available, only about sixty-two percent of newly graduated teachers in the
arts and humanities and about forty-four percent of those in science and
mathematics were either certified or eligible for certification in the
field they were currently teaching. There are already well-publicized
shortages of qualified teachers in some subjects in certain areas of the
country, even though the National Center for Education Statistics projects
that the total demand for secondary school teachers will continue to
decline through 1988. These shortages may well become more widespread as
the children of the "baby boomlet," who began this year to increase total
elementary school enrollment, begin in the early 1990s to enter secondary
school.
</p><p>Moreover, in many districts like New Haven, the current rate of teacher
turnover remains at a very low level. In so stable a teaching force, many
individuals are reassigned to teach subjects they have never taught
before, or have not taught recently. I would remind you of the New Haven
teacher Ernie Boyer talked about earlier in the week, the teacher who was
conducting a very engaging class on Oliver Twist. That teacher had spent
four years in the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute studying subjects in
literature and history, had received a special fellowship for summer study
in England, and was in the year following Ernie s visit assigned to teach
mathematics because he was the best qualified mathematics teacher
available for the position in that particular school. I tell the story to
illustrate the problem of low turnover and frequent reassignments for
teachers in terms of the additional preparation such reassignments
require. In short, to strengthen teaching in public schools, we must
provide for the ongoing preparation of individuals already in the
profession, as well as those now entering teaching. I say this by way of a
reminder from the Yale conference that we know how collaborative programs
and collegial relationships among teachers that stress common problems in
teaching their disciplines can further prepare teachers in their subjects,
keep them up-to-date in their fields, heighten their morale, and encourage
them to remain in teaching. This kind of collaboration remains a most
natural, logical, fruitful, and timely alliance. I would add that the
collaborative work in this vein that we undertake now can begin to create
the professional life, the conditions for teaching, that will help to
attract and to retain those individuals whom we wish to enter and to
remain in the profession.
</p><p>I close with two final observations. First, in 1983 there was a greater
precision and clarity in our use of the term collaboration. At that time
it implied collegiality. Here the term has been used in broader and more
varied ways. As we continue our work together, we will need to sharpen our
use of the terms that apply to partnerships of institutions and to
collegial work among teachers from those institutions. That we are only
beginning this work is best illustrated by the Department of Education s
survey last year, to which more than 9,000 out of almost 17,000 school
districts responded. Of the partnerships that those districts reported,
only about five percent were partnerships with colleges and universities,
while mole than two-thirds were with businesses. In my view, our colleges
and Universities must become a much larger element in the partnership
movement.
</p><p>Finally, I must make a point with respect to resources. Here we have
heard very diverse views expressed. Steve Kaagan spoke about the power of
small amounts of money and how, in that sense, the Mellon Project has been
immensely valuable and will continue to be so. We also heard about the
need to reallocate existing resources, including different models for
bartering resources. We heard too, what to me is a striking comment that
school improvement is too important to be left to volunteerism and a
related concern about providing financial rewards sufficient to foster
serious and lasting collaboration among university and school teachers.
</p><p>Where will we find these resources? In the latest two-year period for
which the Council on Foundations has compiled grants information, total
foundation support across the country for all projects concerned with
teaching in schools was less than $4.5 million. Only a fraction of that
amount went to collaborative programs. Obviously, we cannot look to
private foundations for the level of resources that will be necessary to
promote the systematic and widespread establishment of collaborative
programs. More important, I am convinced that collaborative programs that
strengthen teaching will not be sustained if they exist on the fringes of
institutions, or on the fringes of teachers' professional lives. Unless
partnerships are supported and rewarded as central professional
activities, they will lack rigor and status, and will not be taken
seriously.
</p><p>In conclusion, a measure of our own seriousness about collaboration
will be the extent to which our schools, colleges, and universities across
the country will have joined in supporting collaborative work financially.
That is an issue that over time we will have to address if the movement
for university/school collaboration is to continue to progress. Thank you
very much.
