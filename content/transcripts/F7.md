<h4><i>James R. Vivian:</i></h4>
<p>
Good morning.
</p><p>
Eight years ago the announcement of a grant by the National Endowment for
the Humanities to the Yale-New Haven Teachers institute provided the
occasion, the first ever in anyone's memory, for the President of Yale,
the Mayor of New Haven, and the Superintendent of the New Haven Public
Schools jointly to hold a news conference.
</p><p>
As the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute begins its tenth year in
operation, I am grateful that the National. Endowment for the Humanities
provides today this occasion for President Benno C. Schmidt to hold his
first news conference together with Mayor Biagio DiLieto and
Superintendent John Dow.
</p><p>
Unfortunately the flight this morning from Washington for the
representatives from the National Endowment for the Humanities was
canceled. We believe that they are on another flight and due to arrive
before the conclusion of the news conference. We will go ahead and begin
without them, in hopes that they will be here shortly. We do have the
formal announcement of the grant in hand, so I think I can safely tell you
what the grant will. enable us to do.  Members of the press, in fact, have
in the press kits that have been prepared a description of our proposal.
</p><p>
The period of the grant is from this coming January through December 1989.
The National Endowment for the Humanities has awarded $245,000 in outright
funds and will provide another $100,000, if we raise gifts in that amount
for them to match. Yale will contribute more than $400,000 to the project
during the three­year period. New Haven and other donors will provide
almost $200,000, so that the total cost of our program in the humanities
during the coming three years is about $966,000.
</p><p>
This grant will enable us, in each of the next three years, to offer five
seminars in the humanities that respond to the two Endowment­wide
initiatives announced in October 1985 to commemorate the twentieth
anniversary of NEH. At that time the Endowment called upon schools and
colleges to join in an effort to provide an increased understanding of
American history and culture and an understanding of other nations through
their language and literature.  Included in the press kits is a list of
the Yale faculty members in the humanities and the seminars that they have
proposed to offer during the next three years. Fifty New Haven public
school teachers in the humanities will participate in these seminars in
each year.
</p><p>
Our proposal summarizes the results of our program to date which have
shown that it has further prepared teachers in the subjects they teach,
assisted them to develop new materials for classroom use, heightened their
expectations of their students' ability to learn, and thereby improved the
academic rigor of basic school courses in the humanities. Without
summarizing further the results of the studies, I would refer you to the
fact that they are in the press kits.
</p><p>
The proposal also describes the role of the National Advisory Committee
for our program in advising and assisting us in how we might contribute
most effectively to universities and schools in other communities that-.
have an interest in establishing similar programs. We will during the
three years of the NEH grant announced today be holding national
conferences for others working in school-college collaboration.
Finally, the proposal­states our belief that our program should
become a permanent link between the University and the New Haven Public
Schools, and it details how the three-year support that the National
Endowment for the Humanities is providing will assist us in conducting an
endowment campaign to insure the Institute's future.
</p><p>
Individuals involved in school-college collaboration across the country,
and studies on collaborative programs, stress that such programs depend on
the support of the president of the institution involved in the
partnership. I am therefore especially grateful that President Benno C.
Schmidt is with us today. Mr. Schmidt:
</p>
<h4><i>Benno C. Schmidt:</i></h4>
<p>
Thank you, Jim. I am delighted to he here to express my respect for and
support of this remarkable Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.  Among the
many ways in which Yale University seeks to be a good and active citizen
of New Haven, among the many ways in which we have cooperated with the
leaders of New Haven for betterment of this community, I think the Yale
New Haven Teachers Institute is one of our great successes. In the view of
most people who are concerned with the capacities of institutions of
higher education to assist in the public education of the communities in
which they are located, most people regard this as the outstanding
Institute of its kind in the country. I think all of us can be enormously
proud of the productive cooperation that has given this Institute, created
such a great tradition, and laid the basis for the ongoing cooperation
that is reflected in our plans over the next three years.
</p><p>
I think of all the organizations from outside this community that have
supported the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, none has been more
generous both in their public statements and in financial commitment than
the National Endowment for the Humanities. With the grant that Dr. Menke
announces today, the NEH has extended its support for the Institute to a
total, since 1978, of more than $1 million. This support has been
indispensable to our successful development, and is critically important
to Our continuation and to our prospects for permanency­prospects
which I will support with all the enthusiasm, and I hope some success, in
the effort to lay a permanent foundation for this excellent program.
</p><p>
We are a nationally influential program for school-college collaboration,
and so with the Endowment's help this work and this national influence
will continue.
</p><p>A program like this cannot succeed without many active, supportive
partners, and a number of persons have contributed splendidly to the
effort which now the Endowment has decided to fund so generously.
</p><p>
I want to thank in particular our distinguished Superintendent of Schools,
Dr. John Dow, Jr., and the New Haven Board of Education who have been our
extremely effective, responsive, and helpful partner in this joint program
since its inception, and who in the proposal for the current grant
significantly increased their commitment.
</p><p>
Of course, I thank especially New Haven's outstanding Mayor, Ben DiLieto,
who has been instrumental in the continuation of the program. I have come
to learn that the Mayor of New Haven is a wise and learned man, and I
think there is no one in New Haven who is more devoted to excellence in
education at all levels in this community­and in the private
institutions of this community as well as in the public schools­and
our opportunities to work with him toward educational excellence are
always most rewarding.
</p><p>
I want to thank as well the many New Haven Public School
administrators­subject supervisors, department chairs, principals,
and others­who have been so helpful in the operation of the
Institute.
</p><p>
Members of the New Haven business community have supported the Institute
because they understand that­they are enlighted and public
spirited­and they understand that strengthened public school
education contributes in so many ways to the economic and cultural
development of this community, and to all of our well being.
</p><p>
Finally, I want to thank the teachers who have made this program work, the
New Haven Federation of Teachers, and its President whose support has been
notable, and our own Yale faculty members who have led Institute seminars
and given talks in this program in past years. Under the present grant., a
number of our most distinguished faculty members will offer fifteen
seminars in American history, literature, and culture, and in
understanding foreign cultures through their language and literature.
These themes in the upcoming seminars respond to the current initiatives
of the Endowment. So I thank our Yale faculty members who participate in
this program and those who serve on the University Advisory Council on the
program.
</p><p>
But most of all, I salute the public school teachers who by their
leadership and participation have made this Institute so successful here
in New Haven and so widely acclaimed as a model all across the country.
Teacher leadership and participation is a hallmark of this program, and
the program's success reflects the dedicated work of so many New Haven
teachers, some of whom are present today. More than two-hundred teachers
have taken part in the Institute, many more than once, and with the
present grant fifty teachers in the humanities will participate, either
for the first time or again, in each of the next three years.
</p><p>
I am grateful to the National Advisory Committee for the Yale-New Haven
Teachers Institute, which is composed of some of the nation's leading
educators and philanthropists in education. Their wisdom on educational
reform in this country has been exceedingly valuable to us in advising and
assisting this Institute.
</p><p>
The breadth and the depth of collaboration among all these individuals
from New Haven and from across the country is a measure of the tremendous
value of the Teachers Institute to Yale, to the teachers and students in
our community's schools, to New Haven generally, and to the future of
school-college collaboration all across the country.
</p><p>
I thank the National Endowment for the Humanities for contributing so
significantly to the continuation of our great work together.  Thank you
very much.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian:</i></h4>
<p>
Under the leadership of Superintendent of Schools, Dr. John Dow the Yale
New Haven Teachers Institute has been incorporated in New Haven's 5-year
Staff Development Plan, and as mentioned earlier, the financial support of
the Board of Education has been significantly increased. I want to thank
John Dow for the magnitude of his support for our joint program. Dr. Dow:
</p>
<h4><i>John Dow, Jr.:</i></h4>
<p>
Thank you, Jim.
</p><p>
First of all, I would like to express my appreciation to Jim Vivian for
his leadership with respect to the Institute. Obviously we are very
excited about this recent grant, in that I think it gives stability to an
outstanding program, and certainly our teachers and our students will be
better off because of this stability. Certainly we are very excited.
</p><p>I think this Institute is a model for the nation, and certainly in New
Haven, where you have a university with the stature of Yale, recognized as
one of the finest institutions in the world, that we would have an
opportunity for our teachers to participate with such outstanding faculty.
Ultimately the relationships that are developed and acquired by our
teacher cannot be measured.
</p><p>
I believe that the improvement of our school system can directly be
related to the kind of involvement that we have here and with other
institutions. Frank Carrano and his leadership have certainly provided, I
believe, an environment to assist us in this particular program. I think
that, contrary to what many people might feel, we have demonstrated
through this Institute and others that urban education, urban public
school education, can he an outstanding venture. I believe that the
leadership we have demonstrated here in New Haven certainly can be a model
for the entire nation.
</p><p>
We are very excited about this grant, and it is in concert with the
State's initiatives in recognizing the fact that we must make a total
commitment to our teachers, not only in improving salaries, but also in
quality intervention with respect to their being able to improve their
professionalism and competencies.
</p><p>
I want to give my personal appreciation to the Mayor for being here today
and providing leadership and support to this particular collaborative.
Certainly, it is very important that the administration provide that kind
of support in order for this to be a successful program. We are very
pleased about it, and we look forward to a successful participation in
future years.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian:</i></h4>
<p>
The representatives of the National Endowment for the Humanities have
arrived and will join us now. I am delighted that they have arrived while
you are still here.
</p><p>
In introducing the representatives from the National Endowment for the
Humanities, I want to point out that long before the current, widespread
interest in school-college collaboration, the National Endowment for the
Humanities was promoting collaboration between university faculty members
and school teachers in the humanities.  The Endowment has been in the
forefront of this national movement for teachers from universities and
schools to work together in strengthening the teaching of academic
subjects in schools.
</p><p>
Dr. Pamela Glenn Menke came to the Endowment from Colby-Sawyer College in
New Hampshire, where she was professor of humanities, provost, and dean of
faculty. She is Director of the Division of Education Programs at NEH. are
delighted to welcome her to New Haven, and regret her travel problems.
</p><p>
Dr. Menke:
</p>
<h4><i>Pamela Glenn Menke: </i></h4>
<p>
Thank you. I am pleased to be here today to join in congratulating the New
Haven schools and Yale University on their outstanding collaboration, and
to announce on behalf of the National Endowment for the Humanities the
award of $345,000 to continue the excellent work that the Teachers
Institute has accomplished over a number of years. The model of school
college collaboration presented by the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
has gained national recognition.  The Chairman of the Endowment, Lynn
Cheney, and I applaud the project's use of important texts as a foundation
for learning.  Effective teaching demands teachers who know the content of
the humanities, who have informed perspectives that enable them to present
great works, events, and ideas in an integrated fashion, and who have the
intellectual preparation which stimulates them to engage in dialogue with
students and with one another.
</p><p>
Yale University and the New Haven schools have demonstrated that
excellence. They have demonstrated that the humanities can be the basis
for civic relations and that the distinguished scholars of the humanities
are part of a tradition of public service. over the past eight years with
support from the Endowment, the project's vision has strengthened for all
of us and for the teachers, schools, and colleges who have admired and
emulated the project, an appreciation of the force, vitality, and the
central practicality of the humanities.  Over the next three years I hope
that the project will have an even more widespread influence and that the
project will achieve its important goal of sustaining its work with the
support of the businesses in the greater New Haven community.
</p><p>
Without strong schools there can be no strong universities. Schools,
colleges, and universities are partners in the enterprises of preparing
children, youth, and adults to become the informed citizens who shape our
nation. Yale University and the New Haven Public Schools through the
Institute have the academic intensity and dedication of purpose which
bring teachers and scholars together to form an intellectual composition
of a common heritage.
</p><p>
President Schmidt, Mayor DiLieto, Superintendent Dow, Mr. Vivian,
distinguished project faculty, if some of you are here, and participating
teachers and teacher coordinators, if some of you are here, the Endowment
congratulates you on your very fine past successes, and looks forward with
eagerness to the achievement the next three years will bring.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian:</i></h4>
<p>
Thomas Gregory Ward came to the National Endowment for the Humanities from
the Fairfax County, Virginia, Public Schools, where he was social. studies
curriculum specialist. He is Program Officer for Humanities Instruction in
the Elementary and Secondary Schools Program. He became acquainted while
negotiating details of the grant that Dr. Menke has just announced. I want
to thank him for his assistance in bringing this grant to fruition. Mr.
Ward:
</p>
<h4><i>Thomas Gregory Ward:</i></h4>
<p>
Thank you. I am delighted to be here, and I am delighted that all of the
details have finally been worked out and that everything is "go" at the
present time. Just to add one very brief comment to Dr. Menke's remarks:
the grant here at Yale and the project here at Yale, I think, epitomize
what the Endowment has attempted to foster and to generate and to build
upon in the country, and that is to focus on the intellect and things
intellectual in the schools, as opposed to things managerial and
pedagogical, and I think Dr. Menke's remarks have pointed that out.
</p><p>
One other thing that I would add: in our work at the Endowment we focus on
trying to work with teachers of elementary and secondary schools, and to
help them expand and enhance their understanding of the humanities,
because we feel that at the core of elementary and secondary schools is at
that very core the teacher. It is what the teacher does in the classroom
with the student that really makes a difference in education, and that is
why we give so much effort to teacher training and teacher development
activities.
</p><p>
It is a pleasure to be here this morning. Thank you, Jim.
</p>
<h4><i>James R. Vivian:</i></h4>
<p>
It is well known that the Mayor of New Haven established relationships
between the City and this University which created an atmosphere in which
our Institute might be developed and sustained . We are grateful for his
support at so many points in the past, and for his presence today. Mr.
Mayor:
</p>
<h4><i>Biagio DiLieto</i></h4>
<p>
Thank you very much, Jim. I have consistently maintained that Yale
University is one of New Haven's greatest resources, if not the greatest
resource. A resource that has, in my judgment at least, not been
constructively exploited sufficiently in the past. The program that we are
discussing here today is an excellent illustration really of the kind, of
cooperation that exists between the City administration and Yale
University, and it speaks well for our efforts to maintain that
relationship at a very high level.
</p><p>
I am delighted to be here this morning. I am delighted principally because
of the fact that the National Endowment for the Humanities has seen fit to
make this grant, because it is more significant than simply a sum of money
that is being granted to Yale and to the City of New Haven. It bespeaks a
judgment on their part that the program in question is one that is highly
meritorious and I think that vindicates our judgment in having established
the program here in the City of New Haven.
</p><p>
I wish that I could claim credit for having established the program.
Actually, it predated my mayoralty, but it is a program that I have
supported consistently because I recognize how important the education of
our children is, and I also recognize that our teachers ought to be given
every opportunity to teach our children in the most effective way. And, of
course, this teachers Institute enables them to receive opportunities they
might not have otherwise, that is, opportunities to broaden their exposure
to the humanities and to the social sciences and so forth, and to develop
curriculum that will be used to good effect in our school system.
</p><p>
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jim Vivian for the
wonderful job that he has done, and it goes without saying that Dr. Dow
has done an exceptional job with our public school system here in the City
of New Haven. I laud him constantly wherever I go, principally because I
am deeply impressed with the wonderful work that lie has done. Given time
the city of New Haven can look with pride on the quality of education
being provided in our public schools. It goes without saying that I am
deeply grateful to those representatives from the National Endowment for
the Humanities for granting us this large sum of money which will enable
us to continue the program.
</p><p>
Of course, with regard to President Schmidt­I was present at his
inaugural­and I must say that I was deeply impressed with the
marvelous address that he delivered. But the thing that stands out mostly
in my mind was the comment that he made with regard to his being a citizen
of New Haven, and I am sure that he was not simply sparing for himself but
for the entire University family when he said that. I look forward to a
continuing good relationship with Yale University and all. that it has to
offer, and I in turn pledge to President Schmidt that I will continue to
support Yale University in the future as I have in the past. Thank you.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
The individuals seated facing you will now take questions, first from
reporters and then from others present. If you would indicate whom your
question is for, please ...
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
Yes Sir, from Channel 3. Mr. Schmidt, in light of the arrests yesterday,
arrests you, sir, ordered, many students on campus are questioning your .
. .
</p>
<h4><i> Mr. Schmidt</i></h4>
<p>
I'll take questions about the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute, which is
what we are here to talk about and what we are here to honor. Anyone who
has any questions on that, I will be delighted to try to respond.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
Would you then speak to us afterwards, Sir?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Schmidt</i></h4>
<p>
Yes, I would he happy to speak with you after, but not here.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
Are there questions about the Institute or about the grant that is being
announced today?
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
Could someone elaborate a little more on the Institute's national impact?
</p>
<h4><i>Ms. Menke</i></h4>
<p>
Certainly. As I mentioned in the opening remarks, congratulatory remarks,
the Yale-New Haven Institute has had a dramatic effect in serving as a
model across the country. Among its many activities­ and Mr. Vivian
or Tom Ward may want to expand on those­among its many activities are
dissemination conferences which make available approaches used, as well as
some of the materials used in conversations with teachers, to interested
schools, school systems, and teachers across the nation.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
How many are there? Are there hundreds or thousands?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
We have, since 1978, furnished materials to scores of institutions across
the country that have sought to know more about what we have done. We have
participated in conferences that we have organized and that others have
organized, and have consulted individually and in teams with people from
schools and colleges in other places. There are a number of programs
established at other institutions which have drawn, if not wholesale, at
least to some extent on our experience here: for instance, at the
University of Washington, at Duke University, at Lehigh University, at the
University of New Mexico. We will in November be holding the first of the
conferences that Menke referred to­under a present grant from the
National Endowment for the Humanities­that will bring together
representatives from about fifteen of these programs that we have assisted
in the past, and we will be holding annual conferences in the same vein
during the next three years.
</p><p>Are there other questions?
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
I am a little confused on the $100,000 matching grant. Exactly from whom
is that?
</p>
<h4><i>Ms. Menke</i></h4>
<p>
I can respond to the one half; you can respond to the match. The National
Endowment for the Humanities is quite interested in, encouraging the use
of Treasury funds, which are intended to stimulate private, foundation,
corporate donations from other sources. So there is in the $345,000, I
believe $100,000 in Treasury funds, which are to be matched on a
one­to­one basis by funds raised by the Institute from whatever
.sources.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
Which we hope to do. The first grant that we received from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, in fact, contained a similar provision, and
we were able to secure a gift that entitled us then to the matching funds
from NEH, and that we hope to do again.
</p>
<h4><i>Ms. Menke</i></h4>
<p>
As a p.s. to that, one of the things that pleases us about this particular
project is the hope that it may become self-sustaining.  The money that
the Endowment has given is money that has stimulated, encouraged,
supported a project which will find a permanent place, and that pleases us
greatly.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
Has NEH funding diminished over the years? In the three-year period, is
the grant less this time?
</p>
<h4><i>Ms. Menke</i></h4>
<p>
The Treasury matching monies have increased over the years, as a matter of
fact. Yes.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
But the overall grant?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
It is approximately of the same magnitude as the Endowment has been
providing annually since 1978. Their support has been magnificently
consistent.
</p><p>
Are there other questions from reporters before I open the floor to
questions from others?
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
Are there other programs or academic fields that you are going to
continue? You are talking mostly about the humanities, but over the next
three years will you be looking at the sciences or any of that with other
funds?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
We announced this past year a major grant from the Carnegie Corporation of
New York which provides, over a similar period of time, for seminars in
mathematics, the sciences, and technology. The two grants combined, in
fact, give us the first period of time in the Institute's history where we
can look, down the road three years with secure funding in all of these
academic fields with the exception only of this amount of matching money
that we must still raise.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
The Carnegie Corporation?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
The Carnegie Corporation of New York.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
And how large was that grant?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
That is a $250,000, three-year grant.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
How many Yale faculty members take part each year?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
Under the Carnegie grant we will offer seminars led by three Yale faculty
members in each year.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
When was the NEH proposal submitted and is the Endowment's procedure for
deciding which grants you will award?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
We submitted the proposal before the January deadline­ immediately
before the deadline.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Ward</i></h4>
<p>
Our review process takes this length of time for the proposals to be
reviewed and to go through all of the phases of the review process, peer
review and review internally and review by the National Council on the
Humanities, who are a Presidentially appointed body.  The final approval
comes from the Chairman of the Endowment.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
Present today, in addition to reporters, are a number of participants in
the program. We perhaps have time for one or two question from them if
there are any. Are there any of the others present, who have a question?
Mr. Langan.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
In light of the questions we have just heard how competitive was this
grant process? How many other proposals came in and how many grants were
made? We hear a lot of press talking about teacher collaboration between
higher education and public schools.  Has there been an increase in these
types of proposals?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Ward</i></h4>
<p>
Well, I think we receive a number of proposals. At each deadline we
receive proposals for a number of different categories of funding,
including institutes which have often a national focus as opposed to a
collaborative focus, which is what the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
is. At this particular deadline . . .
</p>
<h4><i>Ms. Menke</i></h4>
<p>
Of the approximately 120 proposals, and this is an approximate figure, in
the Elementary and Secondary Schools Program, I believe eight of those are
collaborative projects of this nature which were funded. So this is one of
eight collaborative projects­among the most ambitious of the
collaborative projects­and was funded out of approximately one
hundred twenty total submissions, if that helps.  And the answer to the
increased interest in school-college alliance: the answer is yes. There is
increased interest in collaboration at all sorts of levels, not just among
schools and colleges, although those are incredibly important. There are a
number of collaboratives. The term collaboration has become, I think,
almost symptomatic of the desire of people to group and have dialogue
together, but there are other very important projects that have been
stimulated by this one, as Mr. Vivian mentioned.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
I believe I saw a hand towards the rear. Yes.
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
Our school system was recently cited as one of the twenty-five best in the
country by a national magazine. I would just like to ask Dr. Dow what role
he feels the Institute and our participation in the Institute might play
in that kind of recognition.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Dow</i></h4>
<p>
Well, I would just like to repeat that he indicated that our school system
had . . . I think that the Institute played a significant role in that
designation. I think the difference between an excellent school system or
an excellent institution and a mediocre one probably lies in the
opportunities that are afforded the client and the participants.  And
certainly I think that the New Haven Public Schools offer a whole host of
opportunities and what have you to students as well as to staff. This
institute clearly played a significant role in that designation in that it
clearly demonstrated a continued program of staff improvement. Not only
that, the impact and significance of this involvement could clearly be
documented. So without question it had a major impact on that designation.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. DiLieto</i></h4>
<p>
If I might add to that, correct me if I am wrong, John, a study was done
recently that indicated that as a result of the Teachers Institute the
morale of our teachers was elevated sufficiently, so that did encourage
many of them to remain with the school system who might otherwise have
left, and I think that that is very significant in term of the quality of
instruction being imparted to our students.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
Are there other questions?
</p>
<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
Dr. Menke, I have heard your comments on the significance of collaboration
between other schools and universities. Would you care to comment on the
significance? Why was there something about our report of our activities
here that made it more appealing, perhaps on the question of funding?
</p>
<h4><i>Ms. Menke</i></h4>
<p>
One of the interesting pieces of the current activities of the current
Institute was the evaluation report by a very distinguished writer,
speaker, author, of both academic and educational matters, and he alluded
to the "authentic relationship"­there were words in between that, but
essentially what he talked about­that was formed among the faculty of
Yale University and the teachers of the New Haven schools, and that term
when I was reading materials and vie were contemplating the funding for
the Institute, that really struck me.  "Authentic" is a wonderful term;
"relationship" is a wonderful term, and those two together perform that
forge, that kind of alliance, between eminent scholars and dedicated
teachers, I think as I have mentioned in the remarks. They are prepared
remarks, but they were prepared with tender loving care. I think it really
does talk about the role of the scholar as a public servant, and that kind
of alliance with teachers, I think, is something very rare and very
precious, and needs to be treasured. Certainly, that spoke well for the
work of the Institute.

<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
We pride ourselves on the collegiality that exists between us, and we
would very much like you.. we extend invitations to both you and Mr. Ward,
if possible, to visit us in the summer to see this for yourselves.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Ward</i></h4>
<p>
Thank you. We would very much like to do that.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
I would ask whether there are any final remarks that anyone sitting here
wishes to make. If not, to the things that have been said previously about
the grant I would like to mention one more: This grant enables the
Institute to increase to $1,000 the stipend that each participating
teacher will receive. This underscores the importance that we attach to
teachers' work in the Institute as professional educators­at a time
when there emerges a national consensus that we must increase both the
professionalism of teaching, and also the rewards to individuals in that
profession.
</p><p>
So, I thank the NEH for this particular aspect of the grant, for their
magnificent support in past years, and for all that the grant will enable
us to do during the next three years. And I thank them for coming, and all
the others who spoke, and all of you for coming.
Thank you very much.

<h4><i>Question</i></h4>
<p>
I have a question. The question is for Benno . . . I have a question for
President Schmidt. In view of your role and academic training, is there
any possibility that at some future time, you might want to chair a
seminar in constitutional law?
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Schmidt</i></h4>
<p>
Is that a humanities subject? I have had the enormous pleasure once before
in my life of chairing a seminar that was supported by the National
Endowment for the Humanities in which Charles Frankel, a great
philosopher, a great, great friend of mine at Columbia, and I took a group
of lawyers through some of the great texts in the humanities tradition
that raised questions about law and political theory. I think I never had
such a good time or learned as much in my life, and so if an opportunity
of that sort should arise here, I think I might leap at it.
</p>
<h4><i>Mr. Vivian</i></h4>
<p>
The opportunity might arise.
</p><p>
Thank you all for coming.
