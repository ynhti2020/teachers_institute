<center><h2>A Celebration of the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute
<br/>Completing the Challenges 11 December 1995</h2></center>
<hr/>
To mark the completion of endowment challenge grants awarded in l990 by
the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund and in 1991 by the National
Endowment for the Humanities, the Teachers Institute invited all the
Institute's participants and donors to a celebration on December 11, 1995.
(The program for the event lists all the individuals, foundations and
corporations that contributed to the Institute s endowment between 1990
and 1995.)
<p>At the event, Yale President Richard C. Levin announced the successful
completion of the challenges and thanked the many individuals and
organizations that assisted Yale in fulfilling the matching requirements.
He said,
</p><blockquote>Since the time that I became President of Yale, Secretary
Linda Lorimer and I have placed partnership with the New Haven community
at the very top of our administration s agenda. We do this because we
realize that Yale s fate is deeply interconnected with that of the city
of which we're a part. We also do it because we believe in partnership.
<p>Long before any of the current cast of characters were engaged in this
activity there was Jim Vivian laboring in the vineyards, and the Yale-New
Haven Teachers Institute was boldly leading the way to help make an
organized difference in an area that should be the first concern to Yale
as an educational institution, and that is of course the success of our
city's schools. We re extraordinarily proud of the path- breaking work of
the Teachers Institute which was on the cutting edge of recognizing the
way in which schools and universities could form partnerships.
</p></blockquote>Former Yale President Howard R. Lamar then spoke of the
Institute's history and recalled its founding. He said,
<blockquote>In 1977, based on our rewarding experience with the History
Education Project, we made our first application to the National Endowment
for the Humanities to create the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute. In a
meeting that Jim Vivian, Henry Turner and I had with acting President
Hanna Gray, she offered, and I quote, "a good faith assurance to the NEH
that Yale was committed to locating the funds to continue the work of the
new Institute if NEH provided the grant to establish it." We were lucky
that the NEH was as wise and perceptive then as it is now, for in 1978 we
were able to announce the receipt of the first NEH grant for the
Institute.  It was not lost on anyone present that for the first time in
anyone's memory a Yale President, in this case Bart Giamatti, the New
Haven Mayor and the New Haven Superintendent of Schools made the
announcement jointly.
<p>I close as Rick Levin did with a tribute to Jim Vivian whose dedication
to the goal of finding a common ground between schools and universities
has been unswerving. To him, as well as to the National Endowment and the
DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund the Carolyn Foundation, we owe a very
special thanks for working what I consider an educational miracle.
</p></blockquote>
Institute Director James Vivian acknowledged the seminal $2 million
challenge grant made by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund, and the
President of the fund, M. Christine DeVita, said,
<blockquote>In the current economic climate, raising $4 million is no easy
feat. But then again the Institute has never been known for doing easy
things. For nearly twenty years, as you have heard, the Institute has
recognized that one of the most fundamentally effective ways to improve
public education is to work with the classroom teacher. This is a belief
shared by the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund whose mission is to
improve educational and career opportunities for school-aged youth. Long
before collaboration became a household word, Yale understood the benefits
that could accrue both to itself as an institution and to its public
school system in its city by bringing university professors and classroom
teachers together to study and to plan more effective ways to improve the
classroom teaching and learning. This has never been easy, but time has
proven that it has been very effective, so effective that today the Yale
New Haven Teachers Institute is considered a national model, and we at the
fund are absolutely honored to be associated with such an outstanding
program.
</blockquote>
In introducing the Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities,
Mr. Vivian acknowledged the continuous support the NEH provided the
Institute from 1978 through 1994, which was indispensable as Yale worked
to complete an endowment to continue the Institute's activity in
perpetuity. Mr. Hackney said,
<blockquote>
Nothing could be more hopeful that the Institute that we're celebrating
here today. Nothing sees the future through its children in quite the same
clearheaded way as the Institute. So I admire what the Yale-New Haven
Institute has done here. As Christine has said, it is a model for the
nation, and it comes as a model for other universities in what I think is
critical activity of the future in getting higher education really linked
in a more substantial way to primary and secondary education. I m very
proud that the NEH was here with the Institute from the very beginning.
<p>This is an example of a federal-local and public-private partnership
that really does transcend ideology. It's a partnership of the sort that
we need to see much more of if we re going to solve this nation s problems
in the current political climate.
</p><p>I'm also reminded of the biblical injunction: where there is no vision,
the people perish. Without vision I think this society really is in
difficulty. And it s only with investments in the future through our
children, as represented by this Institute, that I take some hope. So I am
very much indebted to Yale for taking this brave step. It really is a
ground breaking trend setting I hope think to do.
</p></blockquote>
Milton P. DeVane, who was Chairman of the Special Gifts Committee that
solicited individual donors, said,
<blockquote>A great deal of the support for the capital fund drive came
from people with New Haven connections. This really suggests to me the
quality that was on the mind of the people who participated and who
contributed to this drive: A real commitment to New Haven and to Yale to
make this project succeed. Moreover, a commitment to the kind of
contribution that Yale can make best to the community in assistance to the
educational process.
</blockquote>
The superintendent of the New Haven Public Schools, Reginald Mayo, and the
Mayor of New Haven, John DeStefano, Jr., also spoke about the Institute
and the significance of Yale completing the challenges. Superintendent
Mayo said:
<blockquote>I certainly would like to thank the National endowment for the
Humanities for work that you've done and the dollars that you have
committed, as well as the DeWitt Wallace-Reader's Digest fund., we want to
thank you on behalf of all of the teachers and students in New Haven.
<p>In recent years collaborative efforts [with the Institute] have
included New Haven curriculum staff participating in the selection of
appropriate units. One of the things that we've done since I've been
Superintendent, is to take these units actually and to make sure that all
of the teachers in our school district have them. One of the other things
that we tried last summer was to take many of the Fellows in the Institute
and actually do a summer program with their students, using many of the
units that have been developed over the years. So that was a first last
summer and it worked out very, very well, and I'm hoping that we can
institutionalize it for our young people in the school district. Recent
projects have included team projects and I want to say that again, team
projects and that's something new with an emphasis on school change.
That's the thing that Jim and I have been talking about more. How can the
Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute have more of an impact on the school
reform that we're going for.
</p></blockquote>
Mayor DeStefano said,
<blockquote>I think this illustrates that uniqueness and creativity of the
relationship between university and community. Occasionally and
increasingly [President Levin and I] find intersections in our
institutional lives where we do spectacular things, and this is one of
them. The Institute recognizes that at the heart of what we do in our
schools is the act of teaching, and that important to supporting that act
are our teachers themselves. With good teachers we can't have successful
students, and the Institute recognizes that. are our teachers themselves.
Without good teachers we can't have successful students, and the Institute
recognizes that.
</blockquote>
As the Institute looks to the future, it will work to increase the
endowment to $5 million or more in the humanities, and to secure an
additional $2 million to provide the Institute s work in the sciences a
similar financial stability.
