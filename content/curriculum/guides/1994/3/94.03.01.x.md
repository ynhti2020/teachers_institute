<h4>
Guide Entry to 94.03.01:
</h4>
This unit will not present a history of man’s religious evolution. Instead, it seeks to explore the principal religions which are alive today, molding our lives in all parts of the world trying to impress their image on our history. The unit deals with religion as a living element in today’s culture. The questions raised are what does man worship, how, and why? Every great religion has noble teachings and lofty moral goals. Yet we find in each religion these high standards are often not the case in thought and deed, ie. practice of most of its followers. For example, do most Christians really live up to the teachings of Jesus?
