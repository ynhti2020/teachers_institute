This six-week curriculum unit is designed for students in the second grade as they follow a water molecule through a watershed. The unit begins with
<em>
Follow the Water from Brook to Ocean
</em>
, a picture book by Arthur Dorros that introduces to primary-level students how water moves and how it has shaped our earth over time. The young scientists will use their skills of inquiry to understand the structure of a watershed, investigate human impact, and participate in activities and experiments throughout. Students will use journals to document their learning as they build vocabulary, identify stream order, discover how materials dissolve or not in our waters, create an aquifer, and design a game that simulates the pollution entering our watershed.
