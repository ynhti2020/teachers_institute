<h4>
Guide Entry to 06.03.09:
</h4>
<p>
Students enjoy real events, with real characters, in real situations; just as American television today is ruled by reality TV: American Idol, The Real World, Project Runway, America's Next Top Model, and Survivor to name a few. What set the precedent for today's "reality" showcase was New Journalism.
</p>
<p>
This unit explores the work of 1960s authors who combined the techniques of journalism with the narrative voice of novels. Primarily through the use of
<i>
In Cold Blood
</i>
by Truman Capote and
<i>
The Things They Carried
</i>
by Tim O'Brien, students will explore subjectivity, bias, the impact of New Journalism on history, and New Journalism's impact on literature. This unit proposes nine lessons that will ultimately have students questioning their perceptions and what they believe to be the "truth."
