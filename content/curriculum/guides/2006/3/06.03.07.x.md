<h4>
Guide Entry to 06.03.07:
</h4>
<p>
This curriculum unit explores the development of the Disability Rights Movement in postwar America. This unit aids students in understanding the political, legal and social activism that fueled this movement and allows students to examine the many stages and major events encountered by participants fighting for the rights of people with disabilities. It provides a short history of how society has treated individuals with disabilities. However, the focus of the curriculum deals with the milestones beginning with the influx of disabled veterans coming home from World War II to the passage of the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990.
