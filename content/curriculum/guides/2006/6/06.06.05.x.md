unitAuthor: "Heidi A. Everett"
keywords: ""
recommendedFor: "This unit provides the framework for a thorough investigation of the brain's relationship with the five senses. The unit covers only the major anatomical structures associated with the central nervous system along with a brief introduction to the peripheral nervous system. This combination allows for a multi modal investigation of the brain's relationship with the five senses (hearing, touching, seeing, smelling, tasting). The peripheral nervous system is briefly covered due to the integral role it serves in conducting the sensory information acquired by the sense organs to the central nervous system. However, the unit can be easily modified to include a more advanced investigation of the anatomy associated with these two major divisions of the nervous system. The content covered in this unit adheres roughly to the curriculum standards for more advanced biology courses such as anatomy and physiology and advanced placement biology. I endeavor to design lessons with the intent of putting Howard Gardner's multiple intelligence theory into practice. The use of the five senses and the creation of art are designed to maximize the roles of multiple intelligences in learning (Campbell, 2004)."
