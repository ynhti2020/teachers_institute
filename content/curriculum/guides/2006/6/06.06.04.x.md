<h4>
Guide Entry to 06.06.04:
</h4>
<p>
The goal of this unit is for students to develop a meaningful understanding of the nervous system and five senses by incorporating visual arts and anatomy. Students will gain knowledge through scientific exploration, art analyses, and creative expression. While meeting the fifth grade science standards for the New Haven Public School system, this unit can be modified to address other grade levels.
</p>
<p>
The unit is divided into six sections, focusing on the nervous system and each of the five senses. Each section includes Web links to related scientific imaging and fine art connections that can be used to initiate and instruct each lesson. To demonstrate understanding, students will create an anatomy scrapbook based on suggested art activities also located at the conclusion of each lesson.
