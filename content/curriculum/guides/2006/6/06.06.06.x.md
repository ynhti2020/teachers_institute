<h4>
Guide Entry to 06.06.06:
</h4>
<p>
This unit was created for use in an AP Psychology class to teach the brain and the nervous system in a relatively short period of time. The brain is an extremely complex concept, and it is difficult to do it justice in a limited space of time. It is the goal of this unit to circumvent that problem by trimming down the material and presenting it in a way that is both memorable and functional.
</p>
<p>
This unit asks students to break down the brain and the nervous system into their constituent parts and then diagram them according to relationship and function. It is a unit that can cut across learning styles and specialties as a function of its relatively flexible requirements. The process of schematic diagramming also allows the students to attach a skill set to the work, thereby giving the students another means of remembering and accessing the information.
