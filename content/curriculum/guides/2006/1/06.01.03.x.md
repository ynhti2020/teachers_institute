<h4>
Guide Entry to 06.01.03:
</h4>
<p>
Primary students' knowledge of history is very limited. A five-year-old child believes things are as they have always been. History is an abstract concept to children and a verbal explanation will not suffice. Photographs provide a means for making history much more concrete. This unit is intended to teach primary students about the New Haven of the past in comparison to the New Haven of today. Students will think about how they live their lives today and ponder what it would have been like to live at the turn of the twentieth century. Topics for instruction include play, school, transportation, and the shore. While the unit was written for New Haven teachers of grades K-4, it can be easily adapted for older students or other locales.
