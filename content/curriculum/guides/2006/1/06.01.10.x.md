<h4>
Guide Entry to 06.01.10:
</h4>
<p>
Children must develop skills necessary to critically examine and evaluate information in order to become successful students. In this unit, students are taught strategies and methods to become critical thinkers. Using photographs of children, this unit allows students to view, discuss, and analyze photographs from daguerreotypes through contemporary society. As a final culminating activity, students will create their own photographs using the methods of the photographers studied. The unit was developed for a second grade classroom with English language learners but can be adapted for any elementary classroom.
