<h4>
Guide Entry to 06.01.07:
</h4>
<p>
My unit will focus on images of the September 11 tragedy. The unit will integrate literacy, social studies, and art. The unit will be taught in a fourth or fifth grade classroom, but may be used in any classroom. This topic is a difficult, yet vital one to teach. There is no easy way to discuss September 11. By using photographs it will make it more "real" for the students. Students will be able to relate and connect to the photographs. Students will examine the photographs, focusing on point of view, composition, and more.
