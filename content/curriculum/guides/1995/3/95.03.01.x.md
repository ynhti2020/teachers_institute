</h4>
This unit is designed for seventh and eighth grade students to be used in Language Arts classes.
<p>
Its main focus will be on the juvenile justice system and the effect it will have upon the students in school and in society at large. Also, it will focus on the Connecticut court system in order to acquaint students with knowledge of the state in which they live. The main objective of this unit is to explore what students know about the juvenile justice system so that we will be able to give each student what he or she needs to know.
