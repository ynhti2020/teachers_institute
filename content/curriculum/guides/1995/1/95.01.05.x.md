<h4>
Guide Entry to 95.01.05:
</h4>
This unit uses selections from three series and creates activities that encourage reader response in the areas of comprehension and writing. Additional activity ideas are included for integration of math into the curriculum unit.
<p>
The three series are The Private Eyes Club by Crosby Bonsell, the Nate the Great series by Marjorie Weinman Sharmat, and the Cam Jansen series by David A. Adler. The books range in reading level from 1.8 to 3.0, and the activities can be adapted for grades one through three.
</p>
<p>
The accompanying math activities use teddy bear counters and base ten rods, and make use of small group and cooperative learning strategies. Children are encouraged to develop number sense as they work with the book characters to solve problems.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this unit is to encourage further reading as learners become more interested in the characters and settings presented.
