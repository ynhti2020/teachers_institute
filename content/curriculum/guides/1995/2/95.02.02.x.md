<h4>
Guide Entry to 95.02.02:
</h4>
My unit is intended for seventh and eighth grade drama students. This unit is structured to be taught over a 6-8 week period. One of the major objectives of my unit is to expose my students to how the classic film “The Wizard of Oz” was created. In order to accomplish this objective, I have reviewed the process in which the L. Frank Baum novel The Wizard of Oz  was adapted into the 1939 screenplay written by Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf.
<p>
I have provided some background information on the author, L. Frank Baum. I think students will find Baum a very interesting character. In addition, I have provided a set of study questions for each chapter in Baum’s unabridged version of his novel that I feel teachers will find useful. Finally, a major portion of my unit compares the book to the film.
