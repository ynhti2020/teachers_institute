<h4>
Guide Entry to 95.02.04:
</h4>
This curriculum unit is a general overview of the way women have been represented in American films, especially since the 1950s. After a brief discussion of the power of film to shape opinion and make impressions, the unit is divided into the following four week-long sections:
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
-Women and Themselves, including self-image, identity and stereotypes, “good girl” vs. “bad girl,” and the tension between love, career and maternal desires
<dt>
-Viewing and discussion of “Imitation of Life” (1959 version)
<dt>
-Women and Men, including issues of age, male domination, and the viewing and discussion of “Tootsie” (1982)
<dt>
-Black and White, including “whiteness” as protection, “blackness” as both sexuality and nurturing, the symbolism of the mulatto, concluding with a viewing and discussion of the PBS documentary “A Question of Color” (1992).
