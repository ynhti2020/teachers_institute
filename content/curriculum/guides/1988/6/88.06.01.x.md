<h4>
Guide Entry to 88.06.01:
</h4>
This unit describes the workings of flight from a scientific (though not overly technical) point of view. This unit also details some of the important, though not an exhaustive, accomplishments in the development of flight. Emphasis is placed on hands-on activities to tie the theoretical learning with a more practical approach.
