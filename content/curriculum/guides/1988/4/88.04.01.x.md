With emphasis on self-discovery and the classroom environment, this unit presents a method with which to introduce the writing of the short story to tenth graders. Students will be motivated to write, and to develop an involvement with their writing that is both personal and interpersonal. It is a six-week unit, within the context of a Creative Writing course that extends for one marking period, and should take place at the beginning of class.
