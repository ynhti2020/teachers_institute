This unit centers on student autobiographical writing. Using daily journal writing as the focus, the students will write about themselves and their feelings. Readings will be both fiction and non-fiction, using excerpts from autobiographies and class discussion to further stimulate writing, but the emphasis is on self-awareness and on writing.
