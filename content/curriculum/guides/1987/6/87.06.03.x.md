<h4>
Guide Entry to 87.06.03:
</h4>
“Space Shuttle Science” is a curriculum unit designed to use the Space Shuttle as a “vehicle” to teach middle school children basic concepts in science. In space the basic needs for survival, that are so often taken for granted on Earth, are indeed a matter of life and death. The primary purpose of this unit is to focus student attention on the micro-environment of the Space Shuttle and its attendant systems of life support in the hopes that students can be guided to perceive much wider relationships as they relate to the planet Earth. Breathable air, potable water and nutritious food, shelter, suitable clothing, clear communications and management of waste are needs that both passengers on the Space Shuttle or on “Space-ship Earth” must face and solve.
