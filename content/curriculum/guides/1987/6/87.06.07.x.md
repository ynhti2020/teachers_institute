<h4>
Guide Entry to 87.06.07:
</h4>
Man uses water not only for drinking and cooking, but also for bathing, washing, laundering, heating, and air conditioning; for agriculture, raising stock and gardens; for industrial purpose cooling for water power and steam power; for fire protection; for disposal of wastes; and for recreational purposes such as swimming, fishing and boating. Every activity of man involves some use of water. For many of these uses, the water must be drawn from a water source. Often, the water that is drawn is returned to the same water source, either with pollutants or increased temperature or both. If taken from large water supplies (i.e. rivers, lakes and streams), this water is used over and over again by downstream communities.
<p>
The quality of water suitable for manâ€™s needs varies widely, and what is satisfactory for one purpose may not be for another. Since water is such an important part of human life, this unit proposes to discuss the following: 1) Physical properties of pure water; 2) Physical properties of impure properties; 3) The water cycle; 4) Purification techniques of natural waters; 5) Purification systems in New Haven; 6) Drinking water quality and protection; 7) Conservation; and 8) Appendix.
