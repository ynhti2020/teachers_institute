</h4>
This unit is an introduction to science fiction as well as a unit designed to start students thinking about the future and their roles in it. Twenty short stories are to be read, and their similarities and differences discussed. The issues of family relationships, nuclear war, death, overpopulation, and others that appear to provide ample subject matter for a variety of creative activities. As students read through these stories, they will be exposed to many possibilities for life in the future. More important, they will become more aware of the present, and how what we are doing right now will affect all our futures.
