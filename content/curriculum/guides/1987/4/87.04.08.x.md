Guide Entry to 87.04.08:
</h4>
American Avant-Garde Artists from 1904-1920 includes the artists Arthur Dove, Georgia Oâ€™Keefe, Marsden Hartley, John Marin, Charles Sheeler and Charles Demuth. This unit provides some simple step-by-step lessons on how to create abstract paintings and a brief biography of each artist with reproductions of their early work and a quote from each that sums up their endeavors in art. The text includes some background material on America and American artists of this period. The text is concerned with the different attitude to Nature by the European Cubists and the American Abstractionists and how that attitude affected the look of the art work from the two continents.
