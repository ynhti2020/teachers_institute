<h4>
Guide Entry to 87.04.02:
</h4>
This unit uses three novels, “Farmer Boy” and “On the Banks of Plum Creek” by Laura Ingalls Wilder and “Sarah, Plain and Tall” by Particia MacLachlan to encourage fifth graders to read for pleasure. Students will write on an almost daily basis using journals to record reactions to the stories and discussions. In addition, the students will also be introduced to genealogy and autobiography as natural reading and activity enhancers of the autobiographical fiction of Laura Ingalls Wilder.
