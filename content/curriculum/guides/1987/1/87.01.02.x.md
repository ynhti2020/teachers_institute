<h4>
Guide Entry to 87.01.02:
</h4>
This is a curriculum unit that is designed to introduce middle school children to art through Latin American arts and crafts. The premise is that children should be exposed to art of their heritage to improve their self images and the concept of the interconnectedness of various disciplines. Included are art history and studio lessons in several different media: fabric crafts (traditional “molas”), pottery (pinch piece and slip), sculpture (modeling figurines based on Mayan and Nayarit pieces at the Yale Art Gallery), painting (political satires through studying a mural by David Sigueiros), and a brief introduction to some Latin American crafts.
