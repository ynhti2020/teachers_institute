<h4>
Guide Entry to 87.01.06:
</h4>
In this curriculum unit I am focusing on a specific cognitive disfunction encountered in culturally deprived students: a lack of spontaneous comparative behavior, a mental process by which relationships between objects are established. In order to help the students to overcome this inability, my main goal is to improve thinking skills by analyzing and comparing short stories in terms of topic, main ideas, characters, occupations, places, etc. Students will compare these stories with similar ones from the studentsâ€™ own country.
