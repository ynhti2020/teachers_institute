<h4>
Guide Entry to 10.04.08:
</h4>
<p>
This unit is intended for Pre-Algebra students. The main objective is to teach students how to make bar graphs, histograms, line graphs, scatter plots and find measures of central tendency. Students will also gain some background knowledge on renewable energy and what environmental impact they may have on the world. The final project will have students reflecting on their daily habits, making a plan and finally graphically representing their projected habits, based on the plan.
