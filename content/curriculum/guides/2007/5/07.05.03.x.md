Guide Entry to 07.05.03:
</h4>
<p>
This is a sculpture-based Visual Art unit on healthy eating and good habits. This unit will describe how to create sculptural mobiles based on the food pyramid. Students will do research on attributes of healthy foods and the importance of physical activity. Each student will construct a mobile, consisting of several food items, each from different food categories and each of a different color. The finished sculptures will hang in the school cafeteria to inspire good eating habits and a healthy lifestyle.
