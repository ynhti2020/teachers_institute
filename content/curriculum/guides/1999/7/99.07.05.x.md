<h4>
Guide Entry to 99.07.05:
</h4>
This curriculum unit was developed to be used with special education students, grades seven though twelve, in an alternative inner city public school servicing pregnant teens and young mothers.  Although the unit was designed for a special education program, it is also suitable for use in parenting classes, or as an alternative topic in a general science class (with some modifications).  The entire unit should take approximately three weeks, depending on the frequency and length of classes.
<p>
The main focus of the unit is to promote a simple, general understanding of basic scientific concepts and processes involved in developing the medical equipment used in pregnancy and childbirth.  The unit provides background science information on the topics of energy, light, sound, electricity, and magnetism.  The core unit topics include the study of X-rays, CT scans, ultrasound, and fetal monitoring devices.
