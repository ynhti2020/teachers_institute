<h4>
Guide Entry to 99.04.03:
</h4>
"Wrapped in Mystery" is a curriculum unit designed to implement the mystery genre into a sixth grade reading program.  It focuses on reading comprehension and strategies to improve student performance.  It also has a third part which outlines literature circles to foster independent reading. The goal is to teach reading skills through a venue that students enjoy.  Hopefully, students will look at other mysteries-be it mathematics, puzzles, or life situations, and apply problem-solving skills learned through this unit.
<p>
The materials selected vary.  Two classic pieces of literature are used, "The Invisible Man" and "Murders in the Rue Morgue."  My purpose is to introduce students to a classic piece and to appreciate its significance in this genre of literature.  Two contemporary pieces were also used, "The Chicken-Coop Monster" and "The Case of the Stolen Ring."  Some students may like the old, some the new, but either way they'll be wrapped in mystery.
