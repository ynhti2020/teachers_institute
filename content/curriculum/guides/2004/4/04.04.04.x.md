<h4>
Guide Entry to 04.04.04:
</h4>
<p>
The unit "Energy in a Clean Environment" is designed for a ninth-grade integrated science class. The topics of energy, work and power are included. The class will begin by covering what energy is and its various forms. The relationship of work and energy will then be discussed. We will then correlate the units used to describe energy, work and power such as calories, joules and watts. A discussion will follow on our current energy use and acquisition and conclude with the issues of alternative and sustainable energy sources while looking at various sources' advantages and disadvantages.
