<h4>
Guide Entry to 04.04.08:
</h4>
<p>
This unit is designed with kindergarten-age students in mind, but can be easily adapted to the curriculum of first and second grade. The students will explore the idea of energy and three types of energy and engines. They then will apply that knowledge to their own lives. The students will relate the idea of fuel to an engine by making responsible choices about the foods they put into their own bodies. The idea of energy creating work, then waste will be introduced through their bodies, and then applied to engines and the environment.
