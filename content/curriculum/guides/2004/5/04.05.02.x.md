<h4>
Guide Entry to 04.05.02:
</h4>
<p>
This unit is designed to teach students how to decipher the mechanics of word problems and then ultimately create their own.  It also focuses on the importance of mathematical discussions within the classroom, both for the student and for the teacher.  The methods and strategies explained in this unit will aid the students by giving them a systematic way to look at and solve each individual problem.  The students can then assess their own knowledge of how to solve word problems by writing their own for their peers to solve.  For students to write a coherent problem, they need to understand and apply the proper mechanics.  These strategies provide a tool for the students to use not only during the course of this unit, but also during the course of their school career and of course on standardized tests like the CMT.
