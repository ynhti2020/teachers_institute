<h4>
Guide Entry to 04.05.01:
</h4>
<p>
Problem solving and word problems seem to be a universal concern at all grade levels.  Students see a word problem and feel overwhelmed and nervous.  They tend to use the numbers that they see, guess the operation, solve it, and move on.  Problem solving is a "life skill."  It is a skill that students will use in their everyday activities and careers.

It is important that students understand how to solve word problems.  Students must follow steps when solving a problem.  This unit is designed for my second grade class, but can be used and modified for grade three.  The unit touches upon many important ideas/concepts in problem solving.  The concepts that I focus on are as follows:
</p>
<p>
Place Value
</p>
<p>
Addition and Subtraction (within 10)
</p>
<p>
Fact Families
</p>
<p>
Addition and Subtraction (within 20)
</p>
<p>
Addition and Subtraction with and without regrouping
</p>
<p>
Strategies for solving word problems
</p>
<p>
I have combined what I learned at the seminars from my colleagues, what I learned through my experience as a teacher, and what I learned from my seminar readings.  In my unit I discuss books written by Liping Ma, Marilyn Burns, Magdalene Lampert, and T. Carpenter.
