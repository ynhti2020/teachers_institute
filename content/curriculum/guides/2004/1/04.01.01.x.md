<h4>
Guide Entry to 04.01.01:
</h4>
<p>
This unit is intended for a senior honors or Advanced Placement Biology class and will require about two to four weeks to complete, depending on the studentsâ€™ aptitude and prior knowledge. The New Haven Public Schools Science Curriculum demonstrates a commitment to the discussion of current science events among its teachers and students. The questioning of modern biological techniques and the discussion of its social and moral implications is a vital part of a science curriculum; this includes any legal issues that may arise. The bullets to be covered in the unit stem from the Connecticut Common Core of Teaching and Learning and were adapted by The New Haven Public School science curriculum committee. They include:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
1. Preparing and defending a position on the ethics of genetic engineering;
<dt>
2. Preparing persuasive writing on gene splicing and cloning;
<dt>
3. Preparing and delivering oral presentations on possible benefits and problems of recombinant DNA technology.
