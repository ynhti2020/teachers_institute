<p>
Young people discover who they are by coming into contact with literature (folktales, fairy tales, family stories, oral fables) They link their personal lives with those of the characters in the stories. Children are allowed to experiment with their feelings through the exercises of recreating the narratives they hear. Who does not cry at the death of Charlotte in

This unit will provide different opportunities for examining the representation of ethnicity in one of the most popular and widespread tales: "Cinderella," studied in detail and read in different versions from China, Korea, France, Vietnam, Israel, the Native American tradition and Egypt, in order to explore different cultural aspects of the story. The unit makes teaching and learning personal, with the student the worker rather than the receiver of teacher-delivered instructional services. In listening to, telling, reading, writing, and adapting the stories, the students will be prepared to master the important tasks targeted in the lesson objectives, while they explore ethnicity.
