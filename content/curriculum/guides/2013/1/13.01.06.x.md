Guide Entry to 13.01.06:
</h4>
<p>
Today's students are writing all the time. They're texting, tweeting, and updating their statuses. They're also writing paragraphs, essays, and presentations in their English classes. The Common Core State Standards have changed writing expectations, though. With a shift toward argumentative writing and nonfiction texts, English teachers are facing a new assignment: The Research Paper. This unit gives teachers the tools and theory to teach a research paper to high-school students. Importantly, this unit integrates technology, a necessary and helpful part of teaching in the twenty-first century. Blogs, online organizers, and more are included to help even the most novice technology user teach a research paper. It is a daunting task for both educators and students, but with planning, computers, and some creativity, every student can write and present authentic research of which he or she can be proud.
