<h4>
Guide Entry to 13.03.06:
</h4>
<p>
Since my students are always willing to lend a helping hand, I want to teach them about the importance of recycling and the effects recycling has on marine life. My unit will give students knowledge of what is happening in the ocean and how recycling affects the sea creatures. Through the lessons students will gain understanding of what is plastic, the functions and uses of plastics, how to sort plastic with the recycling codes and their meaning, what happens to plastic when it isn't recycled and the effects on sea creatures, different types of sea creatures and how they ingest the plastic particles in the garbage patch. After the lessons are completed, the students will then do an expository writing piece through illustrations and writing about two facts they learned from the unit.
