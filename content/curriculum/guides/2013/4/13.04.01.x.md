</h4>
<p>
This is a unit that covers the Connecticut high school science content requirements concerning enzymes. In order to generate increased student interest and involvement with the content, this unit guides the instructor through a method of teaching enzymes through question-generating activities and current uses for enzymes in bioremediation. Students naturally have questions about enzymes, and this unit harnesses that intrinsic energy, resulting in a highly engaged class.
