<h4>
Guide Entry to 13.04.07:
</h4>
<p>
The fifth-grade science curriculum demands that students learn about light and color. How can we fully engage the students and make them responsible for their own learning? Get them to ask questions! In this unit, students will compare and contrast the structure of a human eye to a canine eye, explore how the different types of eyes perceive light, and examine the properties of light. As students work through the scientific process to understand each concept, they will raise themselves to new awareness and a deeper understanding as they continually question their findings in a safe, judgment-free environment.
