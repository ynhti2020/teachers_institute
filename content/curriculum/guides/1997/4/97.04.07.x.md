<h4>
Guide Entry to 97.04.07:
</h4>
This curriculum unit is designed to introduce elementary teachers to the effects that diversity and culture have on learning styles of students and teaching methods. This unit is based on a horizontal approach to multicultural education where the learning styles of each student are explored. Emphasis is placed on the similarities as we discover our differences among people of our own culture and other ethnic groups. Although the unit is designed with a group of bilingual elementary school children in mind, the concepts can be adapted to almost any group and age.
<p>
This unit includes a set of suggested lessons. The lessons in this unit are set up so that the children and their families, as part of the school community, self-discover and share information regarding their ethnicity and culture.
