<h4>
Guide Entry to 97.03.02:
</h4>
The unit is developed for seventh and eighth grade classes in reading and social studies. It may also be used in language arts. Its main focus is on womenâ€™s struggle for equal rights and justice and the rights of others. Therefore equal rights is not just a part of the past, it is a cord that runs through the entire fabric of our history. The material in this unit will acquaint students with the movements through the ages. They will also be provided with activities where they can do some research and work independently as well as in groups.
