<h4>
Guide Entry to 97.02.08:
</h4>
The development of language arts and socialization skills is an integral part of the K-2 curriculum. Everything—from learning to effectively use the components of reading and writing to learning to get along with peers of differing cultures—contributes greatly to child growth and development in these areas. African-American children’s literature (and literary works created by authors from all cultural and ethnic backgrounds) can be used as an integral building block to empower all students in the above-noted areas.
<p>
In general, literary works created by authors from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds should be incorporated into the overall classroom learning experience. Over the years, however, I have noticed that many educators are unfamiliar with culturally diverse children’s book titles. Celebrate A People was created with this observation in mind—emphasizing Afrocentric picture books for young readers ages 5 through 8.
</p>
<p>
Celebrate A People is divided into three sections that include a picture book resource listing and ways to incorporate Afrocentric children’s literature into Social Studies and Language Arts units throughout the school year. I believe it serves as an invaluable resource and catalyst to utilize culturally diverse children’s literature in the classroom setting.
