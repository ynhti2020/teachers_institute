<h4>
Guide Entry to 97.06.03:
</h4>
Water, Weather, and the World is a multisensory thematic unit which closely examines water and its properties; pollution and conservation; weather and safety; and water’s impact on the earth through hands-on scientific exploration and experimentation. This unit is intended for low functioning students with special needs; however, teachers for kindergarten through second grade may find this information appropriate for their students. This integrated curriculum unit will span many subject areas, such as math, language arts, daily living skills, and art. Planning resources include a vocabulary list with teaching suggestions; background knowledge with corresponding experiments; and a bibliography of children’s literature and science resources.
