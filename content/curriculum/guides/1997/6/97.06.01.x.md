<h4>
Guide Entry to 97.06.01:
</h4>
This curriculum unit is a “hands-on” approach on a primary level (which can be extended to the intermediate grades) to explaining the different effects certain weather conditions and a few other influences have on our Earth. This is done through hands-on activities and a series of experiments.
<p>
The curriculum unit is introduced by way of the seashore using Eric Carle’s
<i>
A House for Hermit Crab
</i>
which is especially meaningful for children who live near the coast. This is also done in a hands-on manner.
</p>
<p>
Prior to the main part of the curriculum, the continents, the continents’ formation and the geography of the Earth are explained—again in a hands-on manner.
