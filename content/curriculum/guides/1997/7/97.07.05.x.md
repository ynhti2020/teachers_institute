<h4>
Guide Entry to 97.07.05:
</h4>
Lead is a health hazard for all humans. You cannot see or smell lead, and often, you cannot taste it. We are surrounded by lead in our environment; however, it does not mean that you will be poisoned. The purpose of this unit is to provide information, awareness, and activities to teachers and students in the middle grades (5-8) relative to the seriousness of the problem of lead toxins in the environment.
<p>
The unit will provide a conceptual framework on how to deal with fundamental problems through sources of lead in the environment; how it may contaminate food and water; why children are especially vulnerable; what to do about it; technologies (batteries) that concentrate lead and disperse it (gas and paint); lead prevention; lead toxicity; human toxicity and exposure; lead regulations and policy; and environmental justice.
</p>
<p>
Students will be exposed to subject content and lesson plans that enhance critical thinking and inquiry through a hands-on approach to learning about lead toxins in the environment. Also, included in the unit is a student reading list, teacher reading list, speakers, resources, field trip information, and a bibliography.
