<h4>
Guide Entry to 97.05.06:
</h4>
The Blues Impulse—An era and the Ambiguity of Adolescence is an interdisciplinary unit, approximately ten weeks in length, with a two-fold purpose: 1) to have students explore the writings, music, and art of Harlem during the 1920s and 30s; and 2) to have students explore their own “blues” in relation to their physical and social development. The students become instruments of adolescent blues representing their segment and perspective of a cultural blues. They are encouraged by creative lessons to explore their feelings through written, artistic, and musical expression.
<p>
The concept of blues music and the historical migration occurring in that time period are to be covered first. Second is a concentration on the blues women and their contribution to the era, musically and through their lyrics. Thirdly, a literary introduction to blues language in literature is done with the study of

and “Karintha,” a story from

Cane.

The ultimate goal of the unit is to have students do a comparative analysis of the blues influence of the 20s and the “blues” impulse of adolescent years.
