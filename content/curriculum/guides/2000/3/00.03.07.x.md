<h4>
Guide Entry to 00.03.07:
</h4>
This unit invites students and teachers to  take a look into medical technologies of the future, namely cloning and genetic engineering..   It is designed as an eighteen-week course in  Future Studies for seventh grade Gifted.  However it is written so that others may use any part of it in science, writing, or drama  classes.    Generally the unit explores some of the current research data in these areas,  explores the government's position on the research and practice of cloning and genetic engineering, highlights some of the positions taken by American citizens, and raises questions about our right to privacy in choosing to practice cloning or opting to have ourselves genetically altered.  Students are asked to discuss,  write and debate and various situations in an attempt to understand the ideas that promise to be a part of their future.
