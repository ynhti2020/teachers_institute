<h4>
Guide Entry to 00.06.01:
</h4>
This hands-on, science curriculum unit is written for the study of photosynthesis in grades 1-3.  Through the implementation of this unit, one month or more of the academic year will be devoted to the study of photosynthesis.  All classroom subjects (i.e.:  Language Arts, Mathematics) will be integrated into the science subject matter.  Full days will be spent discussing and actively participating in the topics of photosynthesis.  A specific section of each day will be devoted to science experiments and activities involving such sub-topics as "Plants and What They Need", "Growing Seeds", and "The Ways of Plants."
