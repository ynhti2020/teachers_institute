<h4>
Guide Entry to 00.05.07:
</h4>
I am a special education teacher at East Rock Global Magnet School, where I teach 7th and 8th grade self contained students.  We have a multicultural population making our focus on global studies appropriate and essential to teaching diversity.
<p>
By researching the history of music from Kenya, I plan to show its importance to the culture.  Music is a form of expression, entertainment as well as communication.  Sounds we hear can control the frame of mind we are in.
</p>
<p>
Through collaboration with a team of fellow teachers, I plan to introduce my students to the culture and music of  Kenya, while exploring the science of sound.  We will learn the importance of music to a culture.  We will make instruments and learn how the different shapes and sizes of the same material, creates a variety of sound.  After the instruments are made we will learn how to play them.
</p>
<p>
At the end of this unit, my class will participate in a collaborative effort to present a culminating activity.  An assembly called the "Festival of Sound" to be performed at an PTSO meeting for parents and students in the spring of next school year.
