<h4>
Guide Entry to 00.07.03:
</h4>
The discoveries made over the past twenty years especially in the area of biotechnology are extraordinary.   Right before our very eyes biological advances have transformed science fiction into science reality.  Continuous research and constant determination have made it possible to clone a mammal, identify genetic flaws and map the entire human genome.  The media addresses this, almost on a daily basis, in newspapers and magazine articles.
<p>
The unit I developed, "Brave New World: Genetics in the Modern World," provides a basic background of genetic concepts as well as information pertaining to some of the current research and developments.  The document contains a student glossary and some innovative hands-on exercises.
