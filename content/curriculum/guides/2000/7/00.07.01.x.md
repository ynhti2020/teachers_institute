<h4>
Guide Entry to 00.07.01:
</h4>
It is intriguing to canvass children in primary grades to discern where they believe foods originate.  I asked my first graders about the origins of hamburgers, fries, and cookies.  The majority asserted "MacDonalds" or the "neighborhood grocery store."  To my surprise, too large a number of students made no connection between these foods and animal/plant origins.
<p>
Listening to student responses motivated me to develop "Inside Out: An Up-Close Look At Foods We Eat."   It is an interdisciplinary curriculum unit that encompasses Math, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts using a hands-on approach.  "Inside Out" is targeted at students in Primary Grades 1 and 2.

Based on the expectation that children ages 6-7 are sophisticated enough to grasp scientific terminologies and related concepts, particularly when presented on a hands-on basis, "Inside Out" will (1) provide students with a better understanding of the origins of food and the food chain; (2) motivate students to make healthy, nutrition-based choices when selecting foods, (3) spark enthusiasm in understanding the inner workings of the human body, and (4) will lay the groundwork for consumer activism and motivate students to explore the wonderful world of Science.
