<h4>
Guide Entry to 00.07.05:
</h4>
A surrogate mother is a woman who carries a child, usually for an infertile couple.  My students' primary focuses are the moral issues.  This unit will be taught in an 8th grade science class, but can also be used in a health and civics class.  Addressed in this unit are moral issues of surrogate motherhood.  The areas developed are:  1)  what is surrogacy and the types of surrogacy; 2)  who should and should not be a surrogate and is surrogacy for you; 3)  religion - from a Christian point of view, how surrogacy is perceived; 4)  surrogacy and the law - an informative tool used to bridge the gap between surrogacy and the law.  Included in this unit are: ethical issues, vocabulary list, resources, lesson plans, reading list, and bibliography.
