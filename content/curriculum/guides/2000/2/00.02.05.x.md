<h4>
Guide Entry to 00.02.05:
</h4>
This unit was written for a population of cognitively low-functioning special needs students in grades 9 - 12. By writing this unit on "Juvenile Delinquency: Cause and Effect," I want to raise students' level of awareness so that at an early age, students can avoid participating in criminal activities.
<p>
In this unit, we will discuss and present tools that allow youth to deal constructively with interpersonal conflicts, problem-solving techniques and behaviors of peacemaking skills. Students will acquire knowledge and skills needed to carry out their responsibilities and protect their rights as citizens of a free society.
</p>
<p>
Lessons in this unit will emphasize basic knowledge of juvenile crime, causes, offenses, treatment, and risk factors. As students work through this unit, they will continually make and judge decisions, and they will analyze decision making by government officials and those seeking to influence government.
</p>
<p>
The reward for learning this unit will be to make significant progress in the lifelong pursuit of becoming a good citizen in a free society.
