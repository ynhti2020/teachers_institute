The purpose of this unit is to help students better understand Latin culture.  They will learn the history of Latinos and how their experiences and values are found in literature and art.  Students will also explore the difficulties and problems Latinos had to and still have to face.  They will then explore their own culture and identity, through the issues raised in the art and literature. Through this unit, students will gain a deeper understanding of their peers and their selves by comparing and contrasting the Latin culture to their own.
