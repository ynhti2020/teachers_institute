<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.05.02:
</h4>
This project describes the political involvement of the Puerto Rican community in New Haven, Connecticut, for the last ten to fifteen years.  Although the community is approximately fifty years old, it is only in the past twenty years that the community has begun to make its political presence better known.  The study concentrates on this period of time although there is a historical survey which includes a short compendium of the political history of Puerto Rico in this century.  Several study aides are included such as questionnaires to be directed at persons occupying key positions relative to that growth.
