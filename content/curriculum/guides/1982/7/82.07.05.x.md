<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.07.05:
</h4>
The unit entitled “Mathematics and Heredity” was designed to expose middle school students to the study of genetics and show the application of mathematics to this study.  The unit consists of explanations of the process of genetic inheritance, the description, and usage of punnett squares, and of pedigree charts.  Students learn about genetics while reinforcing their mathematic skills using percentages, ratios, graphing, charts, and data analysis.  Lessons range from reading and creating pedigree charts to collecting data about physical characteristics, plotting, and organizing this data. The unit should be used as extended lessons to reinforce math skills while explaining the relationship of math to science.
