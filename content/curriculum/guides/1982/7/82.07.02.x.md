<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.07.02:
</h4>
My curriculum unit contains an elementary approach to genetics.  It is directed for a sixth grade class for a six-week unit.  Essentially it will explain the different parts of the cell and the function of DNA. The most important purpose of the unit is to give an introduction to the function of DNA and how it affects our heredity.  Many activities are included to give the students a chance to get involved other than the usual textbook readings or lectures, I have included illustrations of the cell, mitosis, DNA, RNA, and amino acid codes which may be reproduced.
