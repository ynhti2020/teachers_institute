<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.04.07:
</h4>
This unit is a cursory examination of the role of the modern mercenary in the decolonization of Africa.  The unit is approached as a learning package consisting of a pre/post test, the text, a practical work project and a post test.  The text defines what and who is a mercenary, the possible motivations of the mercenary, how Western and African governments view the mercenary and his activities and the political and social climate which made Africa ideal for the resurgence of mercenaries and their activities.
