<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.04.02:
</h4>
This unit is one of the results of Institute study and six weeks of travel and study in the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China during the summer of 1982.  It focuses on contemporary education, an all-pervasive force in Chinese society today, and examines some of the realities of that society.  The unit was written for high school students and may be used for middle school classes as well.  The narrative section of the unit was written as background information for the slide show which goes with the unit (available in the Institute office).  The slides show a variety of schools including elementary, secondary, deaf-mute, nursery, reform and university classrooms and grounds.  Slides have an annotated text giving information about each school and possible discussion questions.
