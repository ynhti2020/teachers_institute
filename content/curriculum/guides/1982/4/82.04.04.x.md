<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.04.04:
</h4>
Today we’re going to begin a new exploration, a voyage.  We’re going to learn about water, boats, marine life and men of the sea—watermen.  While we’re studying the seascapes and the lives of others, we will also start to explore the patterns and seascapes of our own lives.  Why is mankind fascinated by the sea?  What elemental drives have urged man to explore the unknown? Why by sea?  What urge compelled you to want to explore the oceans?  It is just practicality then that causes man to venture to the waterways—the easiest way of getting from one place to another?  What about the present day?  Why do men still explore the sea when faster and safer methods of travel are now available?  In this unit we will explore some possibilities.
