<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.04.08:
</h4>
I took a brief history of Iran’s struggle to become a nation, abstracted major periods of time stated in its history to see whether the United States had allocated weapons during those periods and what capitalist interest was involved.  This unit is designed to be used by a teacher exposing the student to spot research at a beginner stage—most likely grades 7 through 12 This unit will enable the teacher to transmit methods involved in basic research to the student.
