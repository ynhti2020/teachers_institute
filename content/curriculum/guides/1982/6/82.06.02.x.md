<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.06.02:
</h4>
This unit deals with the teenage single mother.  In working with such girls, I found that many lack certain skills vital to survival as single parents.  I believe that some of this information can be integrated into regular classroom subjects.  I wanted to develop plans to teach real life material to the class.  This will include job hunting, where to look for a job, filling out applications, budgeting, apartment hunting, economics, and the vocabulary that goes along with each topic.  I found that I could integrate a lesson on nutrition into any subject.  Also I like to use vocabulary with most of my lessons. This works well for students who have learning problems or for the lower groups.
