<h4>
Guide Entry to 82.06.08:
</h4>
This unit addresses some of the issues and complexities faced by a family having a handicapped child.  The focus is not on a specific disability but rather how a family might cope and adjust to the realization that their child will always be “exceptional.”  There is a need to address these issues because handicapped individuals are becoming increasingly visible in our schools and communities.  With the advancements of modern science most disabled children will live a normal life span.  This has significant implications for the family as it matures.  Teaching a unit on this topic will help sensitize students to the feelings and needs of disabled persons and create an awareness of the stress and joys experienced by a family having such a child.  Bibliographies are offered for teachers to read more about specific disabilities as well as the relationships between family members and the handicapped child.
