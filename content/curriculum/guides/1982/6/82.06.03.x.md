Guide Entry to 82.06.03:
</h4>
<h4>
The History of Birth Control, by Kathleen London
</h4>
This unit explores the medical milestones, the legal questions and the cultural influences which have contributed to current contraceptive technology, family planning services and individual practices.  The unit offers information to promote personal introspection about family planning.  It should enhance students’ identification with women of past, present, and future generations; encourage students to examine ‘unseen’ forces which affect prevailing morality and legislation; promote more effective use of available contraceptive methods; and motivate students to become and remain informed about health and social services which will affect the quality of their personal and family lives.
