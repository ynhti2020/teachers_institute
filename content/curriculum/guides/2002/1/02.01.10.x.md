<h4>
Guide Entry to 02.01.10:
</h4>
<p>
In my unit I use strategies in which the stories of Faith Ringgold and the art of puppetry can be integrated to help children look beyond their struggles, problems, and surroundings so they can become exceptional young people by facing the challenges in their daily lives. The unit, whose primary emphasis is literature, will also integrate various art forms such as writing, music, drama, and crafts.

Willie (a classroom puppet) will assist the teacher in introducing and reading Faith Ringgold's stories such as
<i>
Tar Beach
</i>
,
<i>
Aunt Harriet's Underground Railroad in the Sky
</i>
,
<i>
The Invisible Princess
</i>
,
<i>
Dinner at Aunt Connie's House
</i>
just to name a few of the books found in the unit. A culminating activity includes a drama production based on the story
<i>
If a Bus Could Talk
</i>
.

The unit includes activities suitable for children in kindergarten through third grades with an emphasis on literacy for the first grade child.
