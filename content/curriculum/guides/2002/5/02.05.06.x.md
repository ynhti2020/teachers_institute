<h4>
Guide Entry to 02.05.06:
</h4>
<p>
My curriculum unit, Preparing for the New Haven Public School Science Fair Through Environmental Science, will serve as a basic guide to the rules for the New Haven City-wide Science Fair and a tool for both teachers and students to use in order to produce science fair projects that will qualify for the fair. I will include two different experiments in the final section of the paper that my students in my CPEP (Connecticut Pre-Engineering Program) will investigate for their science fair projects. This will also serve as a guide for both the students and teachers to plan a science fair investigation for their classroom. This unit is designed for middle school students in grades 6-8.
