<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.01.04:
</h4>
<p>
The purpose of this curriculum unit is to help students learn how to draw information from an image, whether it's a table or chart, picture and caption or an illustration, so that the image will enhance their understanding of what they are reading. Students will understand that images convey significant messages and are placed within the text for an intended purpose, as an aid to enhance their understanding of the topic they are reading about. This unit was designed for third graders who are constantly asked to read and demonstrate their understanding by responding to open-ended questions. It is my goal that students will be able to demonstrate their understanding by drawing information not solely from the written text, but from the image as well as in response to open-ended questions. As a result, students will have a strategy to respond to higher-level-thinking questions in alignment with Common Core Standards. Students will understand the clich√© "a picture is worth a thousand words." This unit was created to help students meet literacy and informational standards for grade three. However, the unit can be adapted and used as a tool across grade levels.
