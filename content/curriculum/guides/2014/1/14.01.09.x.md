<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.01.09:
</h4>
<p>
In this unit students will use photographs to help them with their elaboration in the Writing Workshop. In the New Haven Literacy Curriculum there are four writing units. The unit that I created will help the students with elaboration in two of them, Narrative and Expository. It is my intent to have the students use their personal connections with the photographs to help them draw out more details and information about their topics â€“ and become better writers. Through the use of photography, the students will learn what a photojournalist is and does, and they will in turn become semi-photojournalists themselves.
