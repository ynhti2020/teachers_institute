<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.01.01:
</h4>
<p>
How do I get my students to see more than just the written word? How do I foster the connection between words and images that will aid in their understanding? With the Common Core asking students to dig more deeply in their understanding of content, teachers are challenged to find ways to increase student understanding. In this unit, students will be presented with a variety of media containing images that will help them strengthen their comprehension of texts. Students will combine reading and oral skills as they work together closely looking at images that at times will aid or change the story they are reading. Students will also increase their writing skills as they use images to construct narratives. These images will not only enhance the enjoyment of learning but also engage students in higher-order thinking skills in connection with the work they complete in this unit. The unit will examine different types of picture books available and other types of media that may be useful in the classroom.
