<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.01.10:
</h4>
<p>
Are students really focusing on the whole image when learning fractions? Do students merely look at the physical details rather than seeing and interpreting how a shape is divided and shaded to compare and solve fraction problems? This unit delves into understanding fractions and how to apply fraction images to concepts and operations. Students should have a solid foundation to progress in solving problems with fractions. The first step is to develop a solid background in visually representing and explaining fractions in pictures.
</p>
<p>
The main objective of this unit is to teach fractions through pictures. Students will learn and apply the theory of seeing to draw, describe, and compare fractions. This unit will address the gap in teacher knowledge about fractions and the anxiety students may face in learning fractions. The ultimate goal is for teachers to build a strong connection between picture books and math skills.
