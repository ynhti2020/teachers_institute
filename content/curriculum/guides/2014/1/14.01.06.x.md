<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.01.06:
</h4>
<p>
This unit is mainly focused on Latin American history and culture. The unit describes the challenges teachers face daily while teaching Spanish as a heritage language to native Spanish speakers. It explains the purpose and objectives of the unit and its contribution to our district curriculum. Since the seminar concentrated on writing from images, the research part of the unit is focused on Latin American art and writings from the pre-Columbian era to the colonial era, before the wars of independence from Spain. The research covers a wide range of topics, including the place of children in Latin American art and literature. The unit culminates with strategies for teachers and a few lesson plans written based on the national standards for teaching a foreign language.
