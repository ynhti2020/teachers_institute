<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.01.05:
</h4>
<p>
This unit aims to discover the best way to link language to an idea through images, not translation. Most students would think that the easiest, fastest way to learn a new language is direct translation. Since the 1980s the consensus in the World Language community has been that translation is not the best way to teach language. However, contemporary textbooks have not found a way to teach grammar without using English as a way to explain different grammar concepts. Andrew Wright and William Bull have written books that give many examples of how to use pictures to teach grammar and functions in Spanish. In this unit, I provide examples of how to teach these concepts using only the target language and images. In addition, I focus on how the brain learns language and why teaching students about how they learn language can be an effective tool in engaging students in the learning.
