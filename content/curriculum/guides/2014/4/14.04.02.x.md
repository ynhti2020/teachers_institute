<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.04.02:
</h4>
<p>
This is a unit that covers the Connecticut high school science content requirements concerning infectious diseases. To help students develop a full understanding of what disease means they first need to understand the human immune system. This unit takes a look at disease as a failure of the immune system. This is a functional perspective because it allows for discussion around how to engineer a better immune system.
