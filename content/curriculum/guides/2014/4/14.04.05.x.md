<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.04.05:
</h4>
<p>
This unit will explore robotics throughout the medical field and parallels in various aspects of nature. Students will learn about the following topics: minimally invasive robotic surgery, prosthetics, nanobots, and the mechanics of flagellum and bacterial motility. By understanding how simple machines are mimicked in nature and how robotics is advancing the medical field, students will have a deeper understanding of how robotics are becoming a part of our everyday lives. This will allow students to think imaginatively when creating projects for this unit, future units, and their everyday lives.
