<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.02.04:
</h4>
<p>
A community can be described as a group of people that live together and or share a common set of values and beliefs in order to contribute to the well being of the community. In order to be a true member of a community, you must have something in common with those surrounding you. This unit seeks to explain and instill a sense of community within a group of third-graders who otherwise do not get along well enough to complete simple tasks in the classroom or community. This unit will give students from kindergarten through fifth grade the opportunity to become fully immersed in their communities and see the ordinary people and structures as the extraordinary things they can be. As students build upon their research and understand more deeply what it means to contribute to society, it is my hope that they will make great decisions to work together and make their living space and learning space more pleasurable â€“ in turn, leaving a legacy behind in the community that made them who they are.
