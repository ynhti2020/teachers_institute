<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.03.09:
</h4>
<p>
Have your students become lawyers and judges to prepare and argue a momentous Supreme Court case! This unit takes a look at some of the history of equal educational opportunity in America, from the "separate but equal" laws of
<i>
Plessy
</i>
, through the triumph of
<i>
Brown v. Board of Education
</i>
, and the reversal of
<i>
San Antonio v. Rodriguez
</i>
in pursuit of the question, "how did we get to the 'savage inequalities' of education today?" Designed for 8th grade and up, this unit will engage students beyond merely "studying" as they step into the roles of history to research, prepare, write, and deliver their arguments before a court of law. The unit is designed to achieve an active and educated mentality regarding a still pressing issue, through a teaching strategy perfectly suited for the Common Core and New Haven school district's emphasis on close reading, use of evidence, argument, and writing.
