<h4>
Guide Entry to 14.03.10:
</h4>
<p>
This unit was created to allow students to take a look into the past and the struggles that minorities had to endure in order to acquire equal education opportunities and analyze our educational system today. Students will be studying court cases and events during the Civil Rights Movement, specifically
<i>
Brown v. Board of Education
</i>
and Linda Brown's story, and comparing it with a recent case in Connecticut,
<i>
Sheff v. O'Neill
</i>
, which pertains to segregated school districts in the Hartford area. Students will be able to analyze data within school districts, formulate their own opinions and definition about segregation, compare and contrast the past and the present, debate one another about similarities and differences between court cases and critically think about our country's history and the effects it has on our society today.
