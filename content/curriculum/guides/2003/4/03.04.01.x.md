<p>
This unit introduces the physics of light utilizing concrete poetry.  Poetry and physics are complex concepts for first grade students; in an attempt to enhance student performance, I have combined both.  The concept of light as an everyday phenomenon makes this very abstract topic easier to understand and relevant.  Utilizing hands-on activities, simple demonstrations and learning centers this unit explores the sources of light, properties of light and human receptors.  The use of concrete poetry establishes a visual context for the physics of light.  My students include English and Spanish-dominant students participating in a two-way immersion program that promotes science inquiry.  This physics unit was developed in order to enhance the science curriculum in first grade.  As a curriculum and staff developer I will implement this curriculum as part of my modeling and coaching for teachers in the classroom.  For three weeks for approximately a one-hour period I will meet with my students at their assigned classrooms.  A final project will include a written collection of poems produced by the students.
