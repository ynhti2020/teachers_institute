<h4>
Guide Entry to 03.02.06:
</h4>
<p>
This is an interdisciplinary unit designed to give students an understanding of the lives of children in colonial New England. The unit can be best used to help fifth-grade teachers because it is directly in line with the early American history teaching requirements.
</p>
<p>
Students will be actively engaged in using primary and secondary sources to form questions and opinions of what they read.  Students will use their lives and experiences to make comparisons to the lives of colonial children.  Through these comparisons, students will gain a better understanding of both similarities and differences across time.
