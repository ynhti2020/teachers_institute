Guide Entry to 03.05.06:
</h4>
<p>
This curriculum unit is designed to help students understand the relationship between the water quality of Long Island Sound and the effect of pollutants on the shellfish living in its waters.
</p>
<p>
Developed for blind and visually impaired students, this unit offers suggestions for adapting lessons to provide students with the opportunity to learn about science and participate in science labs.  It also will be of interest to sighted peers and will provide activities that allow visually impaired students to work together with their sighted peers on water quality projects.
