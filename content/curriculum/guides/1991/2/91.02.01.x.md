<h4>
Guide Entry to 91.02.01:
</h4>
This unit has been written for seventh and eighth graders. Fashion is the excuse in order to make more interesting the study of history. In the course of my teaching career I have noticed that both boys and girls do not care too much about history but they do care about fashion. Another need is the visualization of what they are studying. Therefore, I believe that by associating the picture of the persons involved in certain events they will remember the events.
