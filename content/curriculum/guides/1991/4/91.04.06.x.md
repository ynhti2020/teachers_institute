<h4>
Guide Entry to 91.04.06:
</h4>
The unit focuses upon the second, third and fourth grade student. The youngster at these levels is in the process of mastering the skills demanded to become a good reader. Some of the lessons take into consideration early educational methods that stress an oral emphasis. Short poems and tongue twisters are used to motivate the students. The presentations for lessons one, two and three are designed to last about forty-five minutes. These would be presented once a week. Each lesson suggests additional exercises that could be done between sessions. A second section allows for the development of an interdisciplinary approach to other curricular areas. It contains references to texts and poems that reflect themes that relate to science, transportation, communication and physical education.
