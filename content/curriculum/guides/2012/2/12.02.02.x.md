<h4>
Guide Entry to 12.02.02:
</h4>
<p>
Who do middle schoolers like talking about more â€“ themselves, or others?  I'd say it's a pretty close call.  In this unit, students will use passport facsimiles and faux Facebook pages (called Fauxbook profiles here) to learn about each other as well as famous French-speakers around the world.  After making their own passports and Fauxbook profiles, students will be introduced to the many faces of the francophone world.  Role-playing can be a fun and engaging way for students to practice language skills.  But sometimes it can feel a bit contrived.  The passports and Fauxbook pages will allow us to circumvent any sense of the stale or prescribed. Employing role-play allows students to build and reinforce question and answer skills revolving around introducing the self while developing a familiarity with well-known people who speak French and the places in which they live.
