The main objective of this unit is to promote a healthy lifestyle, including yoga exercise, to students while determining the moral and lessons of stories and fables. Yoga is an ancient practice that connects the mind with the body. Through yoga, students will strengthen their bodies and stretch their minds to give meaningful thought to the lessons of fables and stories.  This unit also provides students with a sense of body awareness and spatial boundaries. The yoga poses learned in this unit can extend from childhood through adulthood.
