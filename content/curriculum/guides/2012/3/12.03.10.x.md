</h4>
<p>
This high-school science curriculum unit addresses diet, nutrition and digestion. The goal is to engage students with the topic via direct, personal experience with some aspects of their digestive anatomy.
</p>
<p>
The unit is specifically interested in major metabolic biological molecules, namely proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. There are numerous classroom activities integrated into the text of the unit. Images have been chosen carefully for clarity and instructional value. Images are very helpful for understanding such content, and have been carefully appended in the text.
