<h4>
Guide Entry to 12.01.08:
</h4>
<p>
This unit's overall purpose is to help students in the field of Language Arts with the concept of conflict in literature, both in fiction and non-fiction. Regarding the elements of fiction, the students will learn that conflict is an integral part of any story, a factor that drives a plot, develops the character, and engages the reader. Conflict not only is a fundamental part of any story, it is also one of the most complex facets of literature. There are five basic types of conflict: man vs. man, man vs. self, man vs. nature, man vs. society, and man vs. fantasy or technology. Aided by the instruction of Tim Barringer (who led the seminar in which this unit was prepared), the teacher using the unit will apply art seen in the Yale Center for British Art and the Yale University Art Gallery. The art in these galleries will be a valuable resource in helping students to grasp the importance and impact of America's westward expansion, as well as supporting their learning about conflict in literature and in life.
