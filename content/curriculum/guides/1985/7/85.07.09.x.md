<h4>
Guide Entry to 85.07.09:
</h4>
A classification system based on vegetative cover for inland wetlands is explained. Calcium oxalate crystals in a wetland plant, “Nymphaea odorata,” the fragrant waterlily, are investigated. The importance of inland wetlands and laws pertaining to them are explored. A curriculum unit designed as a biological profile of an inland wetland using vegetative cover as a classification system is provided in this unit, and a biological profile of a local inland wetland, Cedar Swamp, can be found at the Teachers Institute Office along with an accompanying slide show.
