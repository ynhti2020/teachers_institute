<h4>
Guide Entry to 85.07.02:
</h4>
This unit deals with an invertebrate, the oyster. The physiology of the oyster and the environment in which it lives will be outlined. Because oysters are cultivated in New Haven, this topic offers different science and math opportunities of local interest. This unit on the oyster is intended for use with seventh- and eighth-grade students. However, the material may be appropriate for elementary and high school. It is the instructor who can best judge its usability. The first and most elementary objective of this unit is to introduce the students to the oyster by telling them what an oyster is, its development and its feeding. Sea animals touch the lives of everyone in our societies either directly through family experiences or indirectly through friends and the discipline of science.
