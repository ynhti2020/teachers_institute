<h4>
Guide Entry to 85.07.05:
</h4>
The human skeleton presents an unusual opportunity to teach mathematical skills and concepts. This paper will show the interactions of the science of anatomy with methods of teaching mathematics. Students can learn basic skeletal anatomy as well as new concepts in mathematics, grades 5-8. The skeletal system can be the basis for teaching: scale, growth charting, tangrams (hand, teeth), graphing, ratios, proportions, percentages, geometric designs, circumference, diameter, radius, metric conversions (length, weight, mass), problem solving, addition, subtraction, and measuring using the body parts as a standard.
