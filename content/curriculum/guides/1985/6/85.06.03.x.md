<h4>
Guide Entry to 85.06.03:
</h4>
Teenage clothing of the mid-1980s is energetic and exciting. This unit discusses issues of adolescent dress: clothing as a form of non-verbal communication, dress representing teenage values, how dress symbolizes a need for autonomy, the recent phenomenon of a teenage style, the historical connection between the teenage dress of the mid-1980s as compared to the 1950s-1960s, and the powerful influence media has upon adolescent styles. Lessons are developed that discuss a methodology of object analysis (1950s Capri pants) and fashion illustration problems that result in a teenage clothing design protect. Drawings are included to assist teachers and students.
