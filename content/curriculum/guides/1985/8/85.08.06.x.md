<h4>
Guide Entry to 85.08.06:
</h4>
The author has written a unit for 7th- and 8th-grade math students which presents a narrative about adolescence, drawing upon the material contained in two major sources, “Adolescence,” by Laurence Steinberg, and “Being Adolescent: Conflict and Growth in the Teenage Years,” by Csikszentmihalyi and Larson. Numerous statistics are presented on various aspects of adolescent life, strictly for the teacher’s information, for much of this section is inappropriate for middle school students. The lessons in this unit are intended to take the student from the basic concepts of statistics (mean, median, mode, data collection) to a culminating activity in which students will conduct a study of themselves.
