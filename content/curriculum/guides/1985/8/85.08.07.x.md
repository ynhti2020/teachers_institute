<h4>
Guide Entry to 85.08.07:
</h4>
“An Introduction to Statistical Thinking” has three sections. Section I: Data generates sets of data from classroom attendance, grades, and temperature and develops a routine to take a set of data and see how the values center by finding the mean, median, and mode and how they spread by finding the range and making box plots. Section II: Random Sample has students generate a random number table and solve random sample problems. Section III: Probability introduces the definition of probability and uses it to find and compare theoretical and experimental probabilities.
