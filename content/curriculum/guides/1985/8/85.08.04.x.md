<h4>
Guide Entry to 85.08.04:
</h4>
The unit provides eight lessons of activity-based inferential statistics. Each lesson centers on an experimental question—eg. What percent of the population is taller than 5’7”? Appropriate sample techniques are tried, and results compared. After several activities, students should be able to describe notions of sample, random sample, sample size and its connection to variations, and confidence limits. No formal mathematics beyond graphing and finding averages is needed or developed.
