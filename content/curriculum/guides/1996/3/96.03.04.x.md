<h4>
Guide Entry to 96.03.04:
</h4>
This unit presents elementary school children with a broader view of AIDS by using film as its core. Initially, material introduces and reinforces related scientific information. It then moves on to dispel many of the stereotypes that people hold regarding HIV and AIDS. Finally, it attempts to develop a more compassionate attitude toward the victims of AIDS and their families.
<p>
The unit takes an interdisciplinary approach and is part of a “team” of teachers from L.W. Beecher School. They are also part of this seminar, and their units also use film to help overcome negative stereotypes. Though aimed at third graders, this unit seems suitable, at least in part, for pupils as high as middle school level.
