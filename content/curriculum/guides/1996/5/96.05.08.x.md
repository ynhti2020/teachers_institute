<h4>
Guide Entry to 96.05.08:
</h4>
Students afflicted with hereditary eye conditions need assistance to help them understand their condition and to deal with the questions and comments of their peers. Developed for grades 9-12, this curriculum deals with these problems by: 1) providing information about four eye disorders, 2) showing how a cell develops from single cell to complex individual, 3) showing how disorders pass from generation to generation, and 4) showing how we are all unique, yet very much related.
