<h4>
Guide Entry to 96.04.02:
</h4>
Fourth grade students learn about the lives and music of immigrants from Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Jamaica, by means of a dialogue between imaginary interviewers and immigrants, in order to develop a more responsible behavior and respectful attitude towards all peoples in our society. They gain knowledge of what it means to be an immigrant, why people left their countries, what was special about their countries, and how they adapted to their new home. The students increase their understanding of geography, history, and languages, and expand their comprehension of these cultures through the different types of music from the Caribbean. They learn to play Latin percussion instruments and rhythms, sing and accompany songs, demonstrate movement to different types of dance music, and identify the elements of the musical styles of calypso, plena, salsa, merengue, Cuban rumba, reggae, and contemporary music of Miami and the Dominican Republican. They learn to recognize the elements that are common to their own music.
