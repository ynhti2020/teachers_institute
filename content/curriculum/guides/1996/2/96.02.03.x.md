<h4>
Guide Entry to 96.02.03:
</h4>
This is a health and social studies unit on the tobacco industry and smoking-related illnesses. It begins with a history of tobacco in the Americas, and how its use spread throughout the world. This global tobacco market created a tobacco industry which is now under intense scrutiny by the media, government, and society at large.
<p>
The tobacco industry aggressively markets and sells cigarettes, a product which kills 350 thousand Americans each year. For tobacco companies to maintain their current sales, they must recruit 2.2 million new smokers each year.
</p>
<p>
Cigarette advertising is aimed at the young. Everyday, 3 thousand teenagers become regular smokers addicted to nicotine. One thousand will eventually die of smoking-related illnesses.
</p>
<p>
The goal of this unit is to empower children with knowledge about tobacco and smoking-related illnesses.
