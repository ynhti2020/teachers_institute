<h4>
Guide Entry to 78.01.01:
</h4>
This curriculum unit stresses the “saturation” approach to reading and writing in conjunction with a totally individualized program for students. The structure of the program has three major parts: 1) Reading material, chosen from hundreds of sources in the classroom library, is used for regular reading assignments culminating in reading reports, teacher-student conferences, and oral reports given to small groups. 2) Writing is done daily; ideas and topics emerge from bi-weekly workshops, reading material and student journals. 3) Independent activities including word games and classroom charts encourage constant use and improvement of skills. Underlying the structure is a belief that all children learn at a different pace and that once motivated, they will learn through constant exposure to and imitation of correct language in what they read and what they hear.
