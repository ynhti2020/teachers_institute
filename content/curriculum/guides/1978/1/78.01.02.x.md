<h4>
Guide Entry to 78.01.02:
</h4>
A vital element of both good writing and careful reading is the development of a sense of the audience/author relationship. This unit stresses the personal as well as the social and historical economic implications of letters. It also includes the significance and development of cryptology throughout the centuries. Activities are suggested that broaden the use of letters to encompass several subject areas: social studies, reading, writing, mathematics. The unit covers basic background material as well as enticing examples of coded notes. There is an extensive list of published letters that is divided by category for students. The teacher bibliography has annotations for a second extensive menu of collected letters.
