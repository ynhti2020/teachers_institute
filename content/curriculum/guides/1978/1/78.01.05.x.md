<h4>
Guide Entry to 78.01.05:
</h4>
This unit is an informal explanation of and preparation for a supplemental English course offered to Sophomores at Hillhouse High School who had been unsuccessful in their Freshman English classes. The limited attention span of the students involved warranted the development of a highly organized program that places heavy emphasis on oral reading, pre-writing and group editing (steps-approach), as well as a variety of activities that strengthen both concentration and skills. The unit is electic, drawing materials from a variety of texts (available at Hillhouse) and from the authorâ€™s imagination and expertise. The second half of the unit is devoted to a detailed sequence of lessons, including suggestions for teacher comments when returning papers to students. Several of the sample lessons can be reproduced and are easily adapted for use in many classrooms.
