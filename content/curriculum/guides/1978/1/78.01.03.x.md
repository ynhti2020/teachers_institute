<h4>
Guide Entry to 78.01.03:
</h4>
This unit was designed for a specific writing elective that would cover the final six months of a year course in SAT and advanced writing skills. The program is designed to have students involved daily in a three-step process that includes pre-writing (brainstorming and note taking), writing (getting ideas on paper in an organized manner), and post-writing (proof reading and criticism). Much of the unit is divided between a review of a variety of methods for the teaching of writing and an extensive collection of creative writing assignments (both general and specific) adapted from a variety of sources. Appendices include a detailed outline of the stages of the composition process as well as a variety of methods for evaluation.
