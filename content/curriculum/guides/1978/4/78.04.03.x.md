recommendedFor: "Most conventional textbooks still recount the history of our country from its earliest days at Jamestown to the time of the American Revolution by combining facts with dates.  This unit is based on the premise that colonial architecture (old homes, taverns, churches, and public buildings) reveals the drama of colonial times and explains much about the lives and concerns of our ancestors.  The narrative includes background information on the two strong and opposing cultures of Virginia and New England (the architectural landmarks used to support the discussion are from Jamestown and Plymouth,) The prose section is designed to be for use with a series of handouts (printed in the volume) and a set of slides (available through the Institute office).  Examples of existing colonial architecture in Connecticut (appropriate for student field trips) are listed at the conclusion of the narrative.  A detailed course outline serves as an introduction for the five full-page handouts to which the narrative refers.  There is an extensive bibliography that is divided into two parts: general reference on architecture and specific works on colonial structures."
