<h4>
Guide Entry to 78.03.01:
</h4>
The goal of this unit is to have students gain a basic understanding of how our economic system works.  The introduction poses three vital questions and then attempts to answer each one fully.  The questions are: a) Why is our system sometimes called a “free enterprise” system, and sometimes a “mixed economy”? b) How are goods produced and marketed? c) What are the functions of money and banking? The narrative is divided into five sections; following the prose portion there are three sample class activities that coordinate with three of the sections.  Student and teacher bibliographies are followed by a long list of appropriate multi-media resources.
