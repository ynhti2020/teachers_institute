Guide Entry to 78.03.11:
</h4>
<h4>
Woman Emerging in the Twentieth Century, By Bernice Thompson
</h4>
The intent of this unit is to point out the struggle of women who are writers to become recognized and included in the literature of this century.  The main teaching objective is to improve the reading skills of students and to help them read for enjoyment.  A brief summary of the history of women in the literary world is traced from their early writings in magazines in the late 1700s through the rise of the new feminism in the 1960s.
