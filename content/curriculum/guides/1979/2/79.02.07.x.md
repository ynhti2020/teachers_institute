<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.02.07:
</h4>
This “voyage” is planned to provide an integrated body of resource material for a high school general mathematics course.  The integrating theme, twentieth-century America, provides the general area to be considered and five “focuses” supply the specific subtopics from which mathematical data to be used in class will be drawn.  The five focuses are: 1) Orientation, 2) People, 3) Science and Technology, 4) Ecology, and 5) Communications.
<p>
This unit is interdisciplinary, primarily combining mathematics and history, and is planned to supplement basic skills lessons.  Detailed lesson plans, activities and charts are included in the project.  The lesson plans are divided to indicate both mathematical and historical applications.
