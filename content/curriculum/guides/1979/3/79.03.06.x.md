<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.03.06:
</h4>
The purpose of this unit is to provide the student with a broad understanding of the social, economic, and political aspects of the Urban Renewal Program in New Haven.  Further, the unit should convey a knowledge that is transferable to any large-scale public project which affects such a large segment of the population.  A brief history of the Urban Renewal Program is included in the narrative.  Several suggested lessons and activities are presented in the unit.  A brief bibliography is also included.
