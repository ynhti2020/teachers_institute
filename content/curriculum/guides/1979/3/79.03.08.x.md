<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.03.08:
</h4>
This unit will attempt to chronicle the development of various methods of transportation that were made available to the residents of New Haven from the period 1800-1920.  The main objectives are to have the students become aware of New Haven’s major contribution to the transportation industry and to develop a sense of pride in New Haven’s achievements.  The narrative presents research on the carriage industry in three distinct periods: the rise of the industry, the industry’s golden age, and its decline.  The unit includes three biographical sketches, three suggested lessons, bibliographies, and lists for classroom materials and field trips.  Several illustrations (that can be easily reproduced) complete the project.
