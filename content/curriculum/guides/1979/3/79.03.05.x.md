<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.03.05:
</h4>
The purpose of this unit is to add an experience-based component to standard high school and middle school courses.  This unit is an extension of an approach developed by Project Adventure; the programâ€™s aim is to educate the whole student through sound academics, physical activity, and learning that enhances self-concept.  This project is divided into two parts.  The first part is a walking tour of Fair Haven and the second part is a canoe trip down the Quinnipiac River. Student worksheets are interwoven throughout the narrative. Bibliographies are followed by maps and diagrams that can be easily reproduced for classroom use.
