<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.03.01:
</h4>
It would be impossible to study the development of Westville or any other area without reference to people, places, and events outside of Westville.  The concept of relating Westville to the world is the major theme of this project.  The unit is divided into three main sections: Early Westville, Industrial Westville, and Westville in the Arts.  The unit deals primarily with events to 1900, although some references are made to this century.  Three sample lesson plans are explained and outlined.  Two maps are included in the unit; copies for classroom use are available at the Institute office.  A combined teacher/student bibliography is also included.
