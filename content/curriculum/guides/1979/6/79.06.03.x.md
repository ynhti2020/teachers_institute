<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.06.03:
</h4>
This unit is designed to contribute to a better understanding of an environmentâ€”in this case the environment of Fair Haven.  The Quinnipiac River is the starting point of the project.  The narrative describes how life developed in relation to the water.  The three general objectives are: 1) Students will appreciate the process of community development; 2) Students will develop a sense of awareness that supersedes superficial investigation; 3) Students will increase their general knowledge of Fair Haven.  Three sample lesson plans, seven suggested activities, two field trips suggestions, and bibliographies are also included.
