<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.06.04:
</h4>
This unit is a brief “sourcebook” on bees.  Students learn to describe the characteristics of the bee, to identify the parts of the bee, to demonstrate a knowledge of the function of the parts of the bee, to recognize the diversity of the order Hymenoptera (Bees, Ants, Wasps, Sawflies, Horntails), and to discuss the importance of bees to man.  A list of needed laboratory materials precedes three sample lessons and several bee illustrations.  Student and teacher bibliographies are included.
