<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.06.01:
</h4>
The purpose of this unit is to present an overview of some methods for teaching evolutionary thought.  Students must come to understand the processes by which evolution takes place rather than teaching it as a record of the changes that have taken place.  The science of heredity should be understood if students are to comprehend and appreciate evolutionary thought.  A clear cut objective is to teach that something unique is transmitted from parent to offspring.  Sections of the narrative cover Darwin, the theory of natural selection and a list of important definitions.  Two sample worksheets and bibliographies are also included.
