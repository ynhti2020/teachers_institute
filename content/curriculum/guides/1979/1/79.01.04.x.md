<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.01.04:
</h4>
The intent of this unit is to use certain fictional texts to study “The Stranger in Fiction,” or “Estrangement in Fiction.” The narrative begins with a discussion of Joseph Conrad’s short story, “Amy Foster.” The process of overcoming isolation never happens for the main character, Yanks Goorall.  A discussion of Ernest Hemingway’s “The Green Hills of Africa” follows “Amy Foster;” here, students can learn that estrangement is not always a permanent condition.  The narrative continues to analyze three other works: Faulkner’s story, “The Bear;” Blake’s poem, “Visions of The Daughters of Albion;” and, Camara Laye’s novel, “The Radiance of the King.”  An “opening day” writing activity concludes the unit.
