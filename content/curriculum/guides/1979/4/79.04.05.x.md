<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.04.05:
</h4>
This curriculum unit will be divided into three sections.  In the first section we discuss our view of learning and place it in a larger social and educational framework.  In the second section, we describe and explain in detail the structure, environment, and curriculum content of “Our Class” as it presently exists.  The third part of the unit explains our method of choosing and using reading materials; this section introduces a group of stories not previously used in the class and includes sample lesson plans.  Two bibliographies are included: an annotated list of works on education and psychology, and a list documenting short stories discussed.
