<h4>
Guide Entry to 79.04.06:
</h4>
Sentence-combining is a process which all writers and other users of language employ either intuitively or upon review and revision.  In the classroom, models are employed which enable students to move at their own rates.  The program builds upon intuitive knowledge that the student already possesses.  There are two general sentence-combining formats: open and signaled.  Examples and explanations are discussed in detail.  Exercises that can be used in the classroom are presented, with possible “solutions.” A teachers’ bibliography concludes the unit.
