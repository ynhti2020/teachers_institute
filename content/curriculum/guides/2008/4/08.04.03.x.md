<h4>
Guide Entry to 08.04.03:
</h4>
<p>
The purpose of the unit is to help my students to learn about democracy (and the lack of it) and other forms of government using film, literature and music. I will be using various materials and resources, including numerous cultural representations of the two political opposite ends: the
<i>
fidelistas,
</i>
those who support the revolution, and those hostile to Fidel Castro (
<i>
anticastristas
</i>
, in Spanish) and the communist state  expatriates dispersed around the world. This unit will allow me to introduce different representations such as film, literature mainly, but also art and music in the classroom as instruments to teach history and to start developing something many high school students lack which are vital to their intellectual growth: critical thinking skills.

The unit is recommended for Spanish students with a basic to intermediate level of the language and fluency.
