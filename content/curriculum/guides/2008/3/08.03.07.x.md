<h4>
Guide Entry to 08.03.07:
</h4>
<p>
I would like my students to learn more about the histories of their neighborhoods, to look at photographs of their neighborhoods at different time periods, to read oral histories of these places and to begin to really understand the rich history of where they come from through a variety of sources. As an end result students will take photographs capturing the neighborhoods as they look currently. Through a comparison of “then and now” photographs I believe students will gain a greater appreciation of New Haven and their own neighborhoods. I will be teaching this lesson in my Digital Art class, where students learn digital photography, the basics of Photoshop, and the research applications of Google Earth/My Maps. The results will be digital maps with images and information added.
