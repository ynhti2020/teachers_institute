<h4>
Guide Entry to 08.02.04:
</h4>
<p>
This unit proposes strategies that teachers can use to help their students come of age as thinkers. It is suitable for freshman and sophomore students and provides activities that prepare students for the Response to Literature section of the Connecticut Academic Performance Test. As they practice strategies that experienced readers use to understand, interpret, connect to and evaluate literature, students will examine a varied array of texts that focus on the theme of coming of age.
