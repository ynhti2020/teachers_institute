<h4>
Guide Entry to 05.04.10:
</h4>
<p>
This unit uses the popular topic of meteorology to include physical science and meteorology in the middle school science classroom. The unit explores the source of weather energy (the sun), energy transformations and distribution, temperature, pressure, the role of water in weather, and geographic location.
</p>
<p>
The curriculum unit contains activities for six days of classroom lessons in support of the physical science concepts addressed. Weather investigations present dynamic, locally based, easily observed phenomena which all students have experience with. The physical science activities are a fantastic starting point for students seeking a science fair project.
