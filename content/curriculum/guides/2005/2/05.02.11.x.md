<h4>
Guide Entry to 05.02.11:
</h4>
<p>
The objective of the unit is to enable students to understand and recognize the importance of cultural identity in order to identify who they are.  The unit focuses on study of the Hispanic/Latino umbrella group, and its roots: culture, traditions, history, art, and politics. Students will learn the influence of different ethnicities and backgrounds on the development of the Americas. The unit contains direct references to, for example, Mexico, Guatemala, Colombia, Cuba and Puerto Rico.
</p>
<p>
The unit is recommended for Spanish students with at least an intermediate level of fluency (Spanish 3 and 4) since most of it is going to be conducted in Spanish.
