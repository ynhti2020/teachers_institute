<h4>
Guide Entry to 05.02.06:
</h4>
<p>
This unit is designed to that will explore identity and culture through the context of National Hispanic Heritage Month.  This unit is not only a means to investigate Hispanic Heritage Month, but also a means to introduce students to the vast world of Spanish while developing a sense of what 'identity' is.
</p>
<p>
In this unit, I aim to use the concept of identity to explore the diverse world of Spanish-speaking peoples.  Helping students develop ideas about their own identities will encourage self-confidence, inside and outside the classroom.  This confidence will promote learning and acceptance of other people, cultures, and languages.  It is important that all students' cultures and heritages be recognized, appreciated, and celebrated.
