<h4>
Guide Entry to 05.02.07:
</h4>
<p>
This unit focuses on ethnicity. I will explore the cultural values of the majority of the populations I teach. This will include African American and Latino students, who will consider the similarities and differences between the two groups. Students in grade five must study the History of New Haven. They will learn how immigration began in America, connecting the two ethnic groups as to when they migrated to New Haven. The students will make connections to their own families.

This unit can be taught to students from grades four through six. For the fourth and fifth grade students, the novels I have chosen can be read by both grade levels. The sixth grade students will need their reading materials adjusted to fit their reading levels.  Some students could possibly be on an fourth or fifth grade reading level.
