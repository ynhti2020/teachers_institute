This unit uses film to teach students the basic elements of story including plot, character development, and causal logic.  Students will have the opportunity to produce a wide range of process writing including: quick-writes, film journal entries, and reflections on them.  Students will also have the opportunity to write a fully realized product piece, the formal film essay, using their own film journal entries as research.

This unit also comes complete with three self-assessment rubrics that can be used by the student-writer, a peer editor, and the teacher.
