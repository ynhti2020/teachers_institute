<h4>
Guide Entry to 05.01.07:
</h4>
<p>
During the first few weeks of school, many kindergartners experience anxiety when leaving their families for the first time.
<i>
Family Finding: Exploring Multicultural Families Using Film
</i>
is designed to help ease the transition between home and school, while instilling an understanding for multiculturalism within the classroom and beyond.  The children will view foreign films featuring families and compare those traditions to their own. This unit is designed for a kindergarten classroom, but can easily be adapted to older grades, especially English as a Second Language classrooms.  This unit is designed to be taught during the first six weeks of school.
