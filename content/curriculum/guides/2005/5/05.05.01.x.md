<h4>
Guide Entry to 05.05.01:
</h4>
<p>
This unit introduces such concepts as ecology, biodiversity, and fragmentation.  As the population increases and the demand for goods increases, there may be a growing conflict between further economic development and the maintenance of unspoiled ecosystems large enough to sustain viable wildlife populations. I want my students to be aware of how human activity can impact their environment. Utilizing hands-on and center activities, observations, and demonstrations this unit explores the relationship among living things present in urban habitats.  The use of journal writing establishes a medium through which the students can expand their language expression, specifically writing in the content area of science.  As an assistant principal I will implement this curriculum as part of my modeling and coaching for teachers in the classroom. A final project will include a written collection of scientific and historical observations.
