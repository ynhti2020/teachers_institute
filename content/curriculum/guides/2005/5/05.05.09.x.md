<h4>
Guide Entry to 05.05.09:
</h4>
<p>
This unit is anchored in the science vision statement of the New Haven Public School curriculum standards and frameworks. This unit will provide the elementary school teacher in a dual language program with a framework that closely matches district-wide goals of literacy and numeracy to the study of biodiversity focusing on science standards. The list includes standards in the areas of scientific inquiry, life science, technological science, ecology, and historical perspectives in science.

<p>
This unit focuses on biodiversity by allowing children to explore and become familiar with food sources, producers, chains and webs, different habitats, the importance of diversity to a habitat, and how biodiversity affects our ecosystem and our lives. Through the use of concrete examples that contextualize and make meaningful a few ecological principles and processes involved in their day-to-day living, students are able to understand how biodiversity is an essential and integral part to our lives. Therefore, as we uncover and discover the surrounding backyard habitats in school and homes, we explain the reasons as to how and why the diversity of life affects our lives.  A glossary of the most important terms, a list of student, teacher and electronic resources, evaluation rubrics, extension activities and standards are provided for the implementation of the unit.
