<p>CRISPR-Cas9 is a gene-editing technology with potential to expand the agricultural industry and improve human health.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, this technology may have unforeseeable consequences and adverse effects for society.<span>&nbsp; </span>Statistical procedures are often used to study public perceptions of controversial technologies.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this unit plan, students will design and administer surveys to investigate how their peers feel about various applications of gene-editing technology.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the process, students will apply random sampling methods and learn how to minimize response bias.<span>&nbsp; </span>Once their surveys are completed, students will analyze the results using contingency tables, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests.<span>&nbsp; </span>The ultimate goal of this unit will be to help students to create clear policies for regulating the use of CRISPR-Cas9 and defend these policies with their statistical findings. <span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
