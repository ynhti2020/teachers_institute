<p>This unit is written with fourth grade students in mind, although it can be adapted for any grade level.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>We want to develop citizens who are knowledgeable problem-solvers as they tackle the challenges of improving the quality of life for themselves and the world around them.<span>&nbsp; </span>One approach that has been heavily utilized in universities and businesses in recent times is known as Design Thinking. It is a model adopted by famous companies such as Google, Apple and Airbnb and they have wielded it to notable effect.<span>&nbsp; </span>The design thinking model is an incredibly powerful and useful process for students to use whenever they are faced with designing solutions to help others.<span>&nbsp; </span>Like any process or skill, it will take practice to become good at it.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the heart of this unit is the Design Thinking process, I have also connected it to life science concepts related to the human body as outlined in both NGSS and Connecticut State Standards.<span>&nbsp; </span>The unit should take nine or ten 45 minute lessons to complete, depending on the complexity of the projects to be prototyped and tested.</p>
