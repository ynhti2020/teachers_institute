<h4>
Guide Entry to 89.01.09:
</h4>
This unit was written with two distinct purposes in mind: One, to supplement or to be incorporated into an American history unit; the other, to expose students to one of the most hideous enigmas ever to plague American communities.
<p>
In order to give students a complete picture of the lynching phenomenon in the United States there are four areas related to this topic I wish to explore in this unit. First of all I would like to present the history and evolution of the term “lynch law.” Next, I intend to concentrate on mob mentality and the role played by the Ku Klux Klan, after which a presentation and discussion of several lynchings will occur. Finally, I will conclude with an in-depth examination of the effect lynching has had on the United States.
