<h4>
Guide Entry to 89.01.10:
</h4>
The purpose of this unit is to give students an opportunity to learn more about their community (neighborhood), or any neighborhood for that fact, thus giving them a greater appreciation and respect of that neighborhood. This unit uses Newhallville as a unit for study. It combines personal research and interviews (oral history) to gain an understanding of the historical development of that neighborhood. We concentrated on three ethnic groups that lived in that community (Irish, Italian, and African Americans). It also deals with the industries of that area that attracted those groups. The unit is designed to emphasize the oral approach to study.
