<h4>
Guide Entry to 89.01.13:
</h4>
The unit will address the church community, that of the (A.M.E.Z.) African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, founded by James Varick in 1796. The organization grew out of the well-known dissatisfaction among the people of color over the kind of treatment they received in the services of the church. The unit will contain detailed research that will identify Varick Memorial A.M.E.Z. Church as the third oldest Black church in New Haven.
