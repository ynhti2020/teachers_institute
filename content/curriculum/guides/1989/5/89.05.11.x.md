<h4>
Guide Entry to 89.05.11:
</h4>
This unit aims to combine an appreciation for the place of jazz in the 20th century with a visual arts curriculum in painting and design. The ideas behind the jazz era and what propelled that music, came out of the roots of black America. They are the very roots that spoke for freedom of all men. In these roots came inspiration for the 20th century Abstract Expressionists. The unit attempts to develop the studentsâ€™ responses to translating music and sound into color and painting.
