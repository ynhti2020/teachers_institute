Guide Entry to 89.05.04:
</h4>
Language Arts skills of writing, reading, comprehending, persuading and analyzing will be taught through the media of newspapers. Lessons, discussions, tasks, practice exercises and tests will be designed to allow students to get the most out of journalism skills as they relate to communicating with the printed word. Students will learn how to describe people, places and events. Students will also be taught how to express opinions, persuade a reading audience, and how to “read between the lines” in a newspaper article. Students will further be taught how to distinguish myth from reality and avoid becoming victims of sensationalism, yellow journalism, chauvinism and bias often found in news articles.
