<h4>
Guide Entry to 89.06.04:
</h4>
The unit on “Crystals: What Are They and What Holds Them Together?” is to help students learn about crystals and their structure. The unit will deal with what is a crystal, the three states of matter, their properties, structure, ions and salts and crystal growth. The students will do some hands on activities with crystal creations, such as crystal on a string, and snowflakes. The unit will deal with methods of growing crystals. One method is by preparing a saturated solution and the other is growing crystals by evaporation. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages that will be discussed.
<p>
The unit can be taught to students in grades five through eight. The Science and Math teachers are encouraged to use a team teaching approach. Other features that will be included in the unit are content, lesson plans, resources, and a bibliography.
