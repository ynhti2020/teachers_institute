<h4>
Guide Entry to 89.07.01:
</h4>
This unit on teaching electricity to middle school students is meant to be a self contained introduction to electricity for fourth through seventh graders. It develops out of the vocabulary and experiences that children have had and uses analogies, demonstrations and experiments to teach concepts and the design of simple series and parallel circuits. I designed this unit 1) so that teachers would be able to give more accurate and detailed answers to questions that children naturally ask when they deal with this material in grade level texts, and 2) to enable children to learn the basics of electronics so that they could design science projects independently.
