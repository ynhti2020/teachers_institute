<h4>
Guide Entry to 89.04.06:
</h4>
This is a year-long unit in which Reading and Writing are linked to utilize the skills needed to become a critical reader and an entertaining writer. In reading mystery stories, pupils will improve their vocabulary, learn skills of sequencing, analyzing, and deducing, and gain an appreciation for this genre! By writing their own story, pupils will learn the format of a good mystery story and improve their writing skills. This appeals to the love all children have for puzzles, riddles, secrets, and problem-solving challenges.
