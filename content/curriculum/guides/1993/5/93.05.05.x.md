<h4>
Guide Entry to 93.05.05:
</h4>
This unit is designed to be used with an eighth-grade science class. It addresses the expected learning outcomes of New Haven’s science curriculum and uses the approved basic textbooks as a guide. The unit is designed for the student to do critical thinking about issues that will face them today and tomorrow. CEPUP modules will be used to reinforce the reading material.
<p>
The unit starts with activities dealing with the scientific method and how they relate to our everyday life. From there we review properties of matter and finally proceed to the topic of “Environmental Chemistry.” Using CEPUP modules we investigate pollution problems in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere.
</p>
<p>
The unit is designed to motivate students to think about the environment and the part they play in keeping it and making it a place for future generations.
