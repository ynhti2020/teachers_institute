<h4>
Guide Entry to 93.05.04:
</h4>
The crisis of the environment mandates that science education focus more on environmental problems. In the early stages of science, students should be given the chance to explore environmental issues through labs so that they have a strong base to build upon in later years.
<p>
This unit is designed to be taught in a self-contained sixth grade. The unit explores environmental issues concerning water use and pollution, deforestation and acid rain, and global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer. It is designed to be a hands-on science unit with labs that have been developed for a classroom without extensive lab equipment. Success of this unit is contingent upon traveling to sites around the New Haven area to expose students as much as possible to “real life” applications of environmental science.
