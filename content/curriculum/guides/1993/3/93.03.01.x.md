<h4>
Guide Entry to 93.03.01:
</h4>
In my paper, I have explored strategies and an array of activities to be integrated into the school curriculum for children participating in school plays. An important component emphasizes the active participation of children in using creative dramatics to invent or create imaginary situations. The unit also contains suggestions of multicultural stories and the works of writers with various backgrounds suitable for adaptation for school productions. A sampling of creative dramatic activities and a few plays for use in the classroom accompanies the unit. The unit is designed for an eight-week after-school program. However, many of the activities suggested can be integrated into any language arts or social studies curriculum throughout the school year.
