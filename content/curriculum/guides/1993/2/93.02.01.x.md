<h4>
Guide Entry to 93.02.01:
</h4>
This unit can be used by junior high students as well as high school students. I will be using this unit for my foreign language classes, but the idea of Folktales can be connected also to other languages. For further help the bibliography can be of help. For the French teachers two full tales have been attached and will be held at the Institute because of their length.
