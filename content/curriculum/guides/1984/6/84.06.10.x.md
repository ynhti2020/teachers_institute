<h4>
Guide Entry to 84.06.10:
</h4>
This unit is designed to supplement the curriculum of Connecticut History which has been adopted by the New Haven Public Schools.  The purpose of this unit is to show how the geographical location of the New Haven Harbor has affected the lives of the people—-present and past—-living in New Haven.  Emphases have been placed on the phenomena of nature which has been prevailing for millions of years. It also tells of some of the goals that the city of New Haven and the state of Connecticut have proposed in order to preserve the New Haven Harbor for future use.
