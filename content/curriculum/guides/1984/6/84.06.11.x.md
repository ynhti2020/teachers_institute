<h4>
Guide Entry to 84.06.11:
</h4>
This unit has been developed to infuse into 7th through 12th grade classes.  Its objective is to teach students the importance of knowing your watershed.  It is divided into four parts, watershed, hydrolic cycle, surface water, and ground water.  The strategy of each section is to provide teachers with background information and then to suggest in-the-classroom, in-the-playground, and in-the-field curricula units to enhance classroom lectures.  A Teacherâ€™s Box accompanies this unit and contains a slide show of the flora, fauna, chemistry, geology, and land use of a local river, along with maps of importance.
