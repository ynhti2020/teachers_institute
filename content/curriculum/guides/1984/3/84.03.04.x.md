<h4>
Guide Entry to 84.03.04:
</h4>
This unit presents a comprehensive overview of folklore in its different manifestations and forms including folksongs, folktales, and proverbs.  It includes a history of Panama and explores the premise that the folklore of any given country often reflects its history.  It alludes to the theory of polygenesis which suggests the assumption that folklore material in general is the common property of the entire human race, since many genre could arise among every people and any form of a genre may arise among any given group.  Various forms of folklore are compared and analyzed.
