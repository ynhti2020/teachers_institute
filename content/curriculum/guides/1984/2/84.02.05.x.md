<h4>
Guide Entry to 84.02.05:
</h4>
The author has written a unit that focuses on the beginning of the development of geometry, from the very first experiences that man might have had with shape through a period in ancient Greek history. The life of one famous mathematician of this period, Pythagoras, is spotlighted as a motivational device, to ease students into the content skills of basic geometry.  The unit starts with lessons on basic definitions and postulates, taking students to the next logical step, the proof.  Lessons are also included which suggest exercises that teachers may use to help students become proficient in the use of the tools of geometry.
