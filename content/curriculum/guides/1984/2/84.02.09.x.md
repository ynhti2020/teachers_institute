<h4>
Guide Entry to 84.02.09:
</h4>
The “Iliad”—A Practical Approach is a unit designed to make Homer’s “Iliad” accessible to most high school students.  The unit contains a brief summary of the legend of Paris and Helen, which a student must know to understand why the Greeks and Trojans are at war, and why the gods are arrayed on one side of another.
<p>
The unit examines the epic hero and the role he plays.  There is a section which explains some of the differences in the way the Greeks understood their deities and the way in which we view religion.  The “Homeric Question” is touched on.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, the unit contains a book by book summary of the story with recommendations for selecting books in the event that the instructor wishes the students to read a shortened version of the text.
</p>
<p>
The unit concludes with strategies for making the “Iliad” more enjoyable for all students as well as study questions, lesson plans, and a short bibliography for the instructor.
