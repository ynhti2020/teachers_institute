<h4>
Guide Entry to 84.01.06:
</h4>
The objectives, strategies, and activities which are set forth in this essay represent a further development and refinement of those presented in the curriculum unit designed in conjunction with last year’s seminar at the Institute.  Experiences gained in the application of that unit and further research into the writings of Walt Whitman, Vincent Scully, Louis I. Kahn, and Charles Moore are the resources which inform this supplement.  Additionally, I will draw upon my own design project which was executed as a part of this year’s seminar to further develop ideas derived from these sources.
