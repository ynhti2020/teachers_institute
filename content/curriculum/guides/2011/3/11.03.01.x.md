<h4>
Guide Entry to 11.03.01:
</h4>
<p>
The purpose of this unit is to identify and utilize poetry with a focus on the sound of sense and nonsense in the first-grade classroom. With this in mind, I will elaborate on how to utilize poetry as a teaching tool to spark the interest and motivation of reluctant readers in the first grade. The use of poetry in the classroom is the best way to reach out to learners of different academic levels by activating the imaginations of each individual student. Suggested teaching strategies and activities have been researched and compiled within the unit with reluctant readers in mind. By exploring the unit, you will discover how poetry may be used to aid in student comprehension and facilitate the implementation of new skills across academic disciplines.
