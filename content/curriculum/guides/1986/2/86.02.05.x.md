<h4>
Guide Entry to 86.02.05:
</h4>
In this curriculum unit I intended to present the different student disabilities that we can work with and at the same time to present other strategies that teachers can use in order to motivate the students and help them to improve their reading and language arts in general. And, at the same time, I wished to enhance the studentsâ€™ participation in school festivities and holidays through the use of Latin-American Poetry.
