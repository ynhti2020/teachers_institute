<h4>
Guide Entry to 86.05.01:
</h4>
Graphing Current Drug Data gives (1) some current views on the drug issue, (2) a history of drug use, (3) specific data on alcohol, caffeine, cocaine, marijuana and nicotine, and (4) data on high school drug trends from 1975-1985. When I wrote it, I was aiming for general math students grades 10-12 because I have found it difficult to find math material suitable to their level of maturity and yet mathematically uncomplicated. The unit could supply graphing data for any math class 7-12. It could also be used in a social studies class. One thing that is different about this unit is that it is written to be used as a student text. I will have a classroom set made for use in different ways.
