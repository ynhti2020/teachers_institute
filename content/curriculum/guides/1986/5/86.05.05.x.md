<h4>
Guide Entry to 86.05.05:
</h4>
The unit is a continuation of last year’s unit. It reports the results of last year’s unit and expands to talk about the standard deviation, tell some stories about statistics, show what statistics is, and provide three computer programs to demonstrate activities one may do in class, or students may use independently. In passing, it answers the question: How can you tell if the coin flips or the dice are random?
