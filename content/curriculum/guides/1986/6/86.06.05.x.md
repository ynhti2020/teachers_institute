<h4>
Guide Entry to 86.06.05:
</h4>
This unit develops a study of air pollution from a description of what constitutes air pollution, specifically, from its coal sources in the United States, and, most specifically, in the northeastern U.S. and Canada.
<p>
The geographic area involved and the particular source of the greatest emissions are discussed. The chemistry of air pollution in the atmosphere, radiation, and the effects upon vegetation are also included.
</p>
<p>
A final discussion includes the legislative developments and the legal problems in assigning air pollution liability. Specific attention is given to New Haven.
