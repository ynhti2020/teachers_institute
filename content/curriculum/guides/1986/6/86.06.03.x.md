</h4>
This unit is designed for seventh and eighth grade students. The purpose of this unit is to provide an historical aspect to the developments which lead to the discovery of coal and coal mining through the origins and kinds of coal; types and methods of coal mining, hazards of mining, measures of safety and chemical by-products of coal. This unit is divided into three sections. The first section focuses on coal and coal mining with five different quizzes. The second section focuses on word problems and math dealing with the measurement and computation of different polygons. The final section deals with problems based upon energy and its resources. This unit can be used to teach Math and Science through the: 1. origins and kinds of coal; 2. types and methods of coal mining; 3. hazards of mining and measures of safety; 4. chemical by-products of coal; 5. labor force and economics.
