<h4>
Guide Entry to 86.04.07:
</h4>
This unit is designed for teachers who want to provide their children more writing experiences without themselves being bogged down by the endless paperwork that most teachers envision whenever a writing program is proposed.
<p>
The writing is painless also for the student since much of the writing is done without the need for formal correction by the teacher. This is possible because the unit teaches children various ways to self-correct their own work either alone or with peer-response groups.
</p>
<p>
Also in the unit students will be encouraged to express themselves quite often using free-writing paragraph development techniques and journal writing and to enjoy the endless possibilities of cluster writing.
</p>
<p>
The unit is most directed toward middle-school teachers teaching in contained classrooms, but many activities are provided for teachers of other grade levels and subject areas.

(Recommended for Language Arts classes, grades 6-9)
