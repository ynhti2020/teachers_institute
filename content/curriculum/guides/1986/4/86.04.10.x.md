<h4>
Guide Entry to 86.04.10:
</h4>
In this paper, I discuss students whose life style and resistences to learning have interfered with their language acquisition and skill in expression. What may be a weakness at the early grades has deepened into severe inadequacies in and deterrents to learning at the upper grades. Thus students in grades 7-12 who read and write (if they do at all) at grade levels 1-4 no longer have the language skills to deal with age-level information and subjectâ€”except in terms of their street language.
<p>
This unit offers a strategy which will: 1) help students reverse their direction and become receptive to increasing their formal vocabulary; and 2) build accumulative skills in language use out of the beginning stage of word acquisition.
</p>
<p>
Thus as students progress through stages of development, each stage will build on, contain and advance beyond the previous stage.
</p>
<p>
The stages of development in the unit are predicated on the idea that language growth and development is cumulative in effect.
</p>
<p>
Stages of development involve clustering, creating a street term dictionary, learning proverbs, idioms, and popular quotations and, in the last stage, exploring the use of imagery.
