<h4>
Guide Entry to 86.01.02:
</h4>
The focus of this unit is on the wandering and homecoming of Odysseus—the reunion with his family. The sixth grade readers use two books, “A Fair Wind for Troy” by Doris Gates and “The Children’s Homer” by Padraic Colum, as well as reading some passages and even chapters from the poetic translation of “The Odyssey” by Robert Fitzgerald. The family relationships and feelings in these tales become meaningful to the students.
<p>
Activities include discussion and writing assignments, but the emphasis is on the reading and appreciation of this literature.
