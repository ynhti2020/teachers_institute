The overall unit is a study of the family in literature. “The Village and the Stars” centers on a study of “Our Town” by Thornton Wilder. This play encompasses themes and questions which will resurface in all our readings and discussion: What is the importance of a family in society? How does a family shape its individual members?

Points of interest for students include parent/child relations, love, death, responsibility, and the future.

Wilder’s dissatisfaction with the theatre and “Our Town” as a reaction to this dissatisfaction is discussed.
