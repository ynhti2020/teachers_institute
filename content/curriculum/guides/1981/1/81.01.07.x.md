<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.01.07:
</h4>
The City in Black and White and Color is an interdisciplinary approach to teaching life in the city using literature, social studies, art, and photography.  The purpose of this unit is to direct students to design an artistic and literary collage of contemporary urban life that seeks to interpret, analyze, and evaluate its mettle.  Students will be given an opportunity to integrate their impressions of urban life with established views, thereby enriching their understanding of their own present and future.  The unit will culminate in a student production of a room-size scrapbook depicting the full range of complexities in urban living.
