<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.06.08:
</h4>
This unit uses the actual Connecticut Daily Numbers as data for each of the BASIC programs developed.  The unit will teach the importance of developing logical thought processes and of intelligent approaches to problem-solving techniques through computer programming.  As a student learns programming, he/she will learn quickly the importance and methods of organizing his/her thoughts and actions.  Students should have at least a working knowledge of the computer language called BASIC.  The length of time needed to teach this unit could be two or three weeks, depending on the amount of time you would spend teaching or reviewing the language of BASIC with your class.
