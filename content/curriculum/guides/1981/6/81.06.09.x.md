<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.06.09:
</h4>
This unit is appropriate for use with remedial students who need extra practice with basic addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  The computer programs will offer independent work which is challenging but rewarding.  The programs are motivational to facilitate learning because of the new experiences they will offer. The students will realize through working with the programs that it is not as difficult as it appears.  Some of the programs are designed for the student to type in his own basic facts to receive or give an answer.  There is room for the student to interact with the computer.
