<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.03.05:
</h4>
This unit is intended to guide students in their examination of some of the issues confronting adolescent boys in today’s urban environment.  The Unit is divided into four sections: Identity-self image; Moral Dilemmas; Adolescent Sexuality; Teenage Fatherhood.  Each section includes a vignette or case study, and may be used with or without photographic images.  The strategies provide guidance in developing a variety of classroom activities.  The adolescent sexuality section contains lessons on contraception and a discussion about handling controversial issues.  There are three detailed sample lesson plans developed around three films: “Am I Normal?,” “Teenage Father,” and “Are We Still Going to the Movies?”
