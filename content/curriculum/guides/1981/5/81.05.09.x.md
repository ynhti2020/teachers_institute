<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.05.09:
</h4>
The purpose of the unit is to introduce to the student all aspects of energy use in the United States, with the objective of making the student an educated consumer and an intelligent, informed voter on energy matters.  As much relevant information about our energy situation as is feasible will be presented.  The unit is in three basic sections: (1) A brief history of energy use in the New England region beginning with manâ€™s use of muscle power and progressing through animal, wind, water, fossil fuel, solar and nuclear power; (2) a short study of the physical science aspects of energy in general; and (3) a brief description of each alternative source of energy possible now and in the foreseeable future.  The unit concludes with several activities including role playing and model building.
