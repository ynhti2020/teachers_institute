<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.04.10:
</h4>
This unit on Sense Organs and Perception was developed in a writing seminar.  It is both a science and a writing unit.  Students are always interested in studying their own sense organs and perceptions. Capitalizing on this interest, daily writing assignments have been developed.  The writings are varied but progress from simple vocabulary lists to a short research report on animal senses.  The unit covers vision, hearing, touch and smell.  It included experiments on phototaxis, optical illusions, braille, sensitive plants and even ESP.
