<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.04.09:
</h4>
I have directed this unit toward helping foreign-born students develop better skills in report writing.  This unit consists of five steps which are intended to guide students and teachers in report writing. I definitely feel that if the teacher follows the five basic steps, the students will have a successful experience in writing their first reports.  The unit is developed for students of middle school grades. The instructions are clear and straightforward so that students will be able to comprehend their tasks.  The unit will last approximately four to five weeks, or until each student has received ample time to complete his/her report.
