<h4>
Guide Entry to 81.02.09:
</h4>
The British Thriller is a IA Block English course designed as an introduction to the British novel.  The course assumes a student has taken at least one literature course before, but this is not required.  Included in the unit are summaries for “The Thirty-nine Steps” and “Call for the Dead,” a brief summary of British history from 1880 to World War II, suggestions for teaching both novels and several short pieces, and three lesson plans, as well as a complete study guide for LeCarre’s “Call for the Dead.”  Emphasis is placed on a humanistic approach, although skills are not neglected.  The unit can be adapted for any level from below average to advanced.  Group discussion and composition constitute a large share of the time, and vocabulary is given with each reading selection.
