<p>
This unit is designed for students who are enrolled in advanced drawing and advanced painting classes. The intent of this unit is to expose students to the distinct art form of Graffiti, and its significance on African American art and culture today. In this unit the goals will allow students the opportunity to focus on developing their own style of Graffiti lettering. This unit will also use as a resource information on the art and style of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, along with the history of Graffiti and Subway art. This unit also uses various teaching strategies and objectives and contains five hands-on art related activities.
