<h4>
Guide Entry to 01.04.09:
</h4>
<p>
This unit may be incorporated into the general United States History survey course that is required of all 10th and 11th graders in the New Haven public schools. The history of Native Americans and their relationship with the federal government is a very complex subject. It has been largely dictated by the growing desire of the United States government for land. This unit attempts to examine the history of the relationship between the government and Native Americans. It studies the policy of assimilation that was in effect for over one hundred years. It looks at Native American culture through film, art, literature, poetry and short stories and finally it examines the emergence of the American Indian Reform Movement.
