<h4>
Guide Entry to 01.06.05:
</h4>
<p>
The cognitive development of the human brain is not concrete enough to be presented conceptually to Kindergartners. However, the biology of the brain, the weight, size, shape and sections of the brain are concrete and can be taught. Understanding the biology of the brain will lead students to better understanding the abstract workings of cognition.

Educators must address the needs of their students by first informing them of the brainâ€™s abilities. The twelve principles of brain-based learning and constructivist theory go hand in hand in a classroom that exemplifies learner-centered instruction. Traditional tests as well as other forms of assessment offer the teacher, and student, the opportunities to increase learning and motivation. These opportunities must be regular and consistent for success.
