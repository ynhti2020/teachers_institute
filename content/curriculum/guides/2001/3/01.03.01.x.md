<h4>
Guide Entry to 01.03.01:
</h4>
<p>
In my unit I use strategies in which poetry and the art of puppetry can be integrated into a unit for helping children capture the beauty and magic of feelings and emotions, instilling those positive experiences within their young lives to help them express love on life’s pathway. The unit whose primary emphasis is poetry will also integrate various art forms such as literature (African American), writing, song, drama, and crafts.

<p>
Wednesday Delight, and her puppet friends will assist the children in reading poems such as “Honey I Love,” by Eloise Greenfield, “The Reason I Like Chocolate,” by Nikki Giovanni, and “Hope,” by Langston Hughes just to name a few of the poems found in the unit. A culminating activity includes a drama production based on the story “No Mirrors in My Nana’s House.”

<p>
The unit includes activities suitable for children in kindergarten through third grades with an emphasis on literacy for the first grade child.
