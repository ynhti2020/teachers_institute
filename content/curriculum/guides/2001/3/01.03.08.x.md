<h4>
Guide Entry to 01.03.08:
</h4>
<p>
This curriculum unit is designed for high school seniors, any level. It is meant to give seniors a tangible and meaningful way to end their high school years. Using rap music and poetry as a basis of study, students will create their own journals filled with original art work and poetry. My objectives with this unit are to give the gift of poetry to students who will be leaving at the end of the year, take the fear out of of poetry, memorize some new poems, have a poetry slam with another school, improve public speaking skills, and give students a much needed way to express themselves. The poets we will study include Tupac Shakur, Walt Whitman, Gwendolyn Brooks, Langston Hughes, Robert Frost, John Updike, Allen Ginsberg and the music of rap and rock and roll.
