<h4>
Guide Entry to 01.05.03:
</h4>
<p>
The unit is written for use with elementary-level students in grade three, although it could be used with grades level two to five with some alterations. The unit discusses the beam, arch and suspension bridge as well as the movable bridges. There are hands-on activities for the students to do from building arches, to planning out their own bridge project. Students are familiarized with how bridges are built, what criteria are used in deciding where a bridge can go, and how a bridge can impact a community both positively and negatively. There are bibliographies for the teacher as well as the student along with popular Web sites available.
