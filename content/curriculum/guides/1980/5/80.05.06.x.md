<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.05.06:
</h4>
My unit involves the studying and observing of city animals.  The sparrow, starling, pigeon and gray squirrel are the focus of the unit.  Activities on animal observation, games involving birds and lists of teacher and student bibliographies are included.  The purpose of the unit is to make inner city children more aware of their environment by giving them the opportunity to study it.
