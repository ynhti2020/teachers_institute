<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.05.11:
</h4>
This unit presents a history of scientific thought relating to the origin of life as explained mainly by the early Greek scientific philosophers.  The unit begins with the eighth century B.C. and concludes with the fourth century B.C.  Since the scope of the unit is limited to this time period the unit deals with information which, for the most is scientifically outdated.  The purpose of the unit is not to impart scientific knowledge for its own sake but rather to show how scientific thinkers came to their conclusions based upon how science was viewed in the scheme of history.  The actual purpose then is to combine the areas of history and science to show the relationship between these two academic disciplines.
