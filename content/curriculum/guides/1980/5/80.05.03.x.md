The unit takes you from sperm and egg development through conception to birth.  The unit begins with a very short history of the science of human embryology, including several of the early theories.  Then you are given a short review with diagrams of the human reproductive systems.  Section three is the central theme; it begins with the three stages of prenatal development, the development of the senses, it covers birth defects, genetic and the influence of the following on prenatal development: nutrition, drugs, smoking and alcohol.
