<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.05.12:
</h4>
Developing Environmental Awareness Through Problem Solving has two parts.  The first part works with developing personal linkage to the immediate environment using basic math skills.  The second part continues in the same manner but extends this linkage from the immediate environment to Earthâ€™s natural resources.  The importance of problem solving is stressed.
