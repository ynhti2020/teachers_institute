<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.05.02:
</h4>
This unit pertains to the circulatory system.  The unit is described to the reader in six different learning areas: history and discoveries, blood and its parts, blood vessels, the heart and diseases of the heart and blood.  The reader can use the factual information that is given for each different learning area.  There are lessons which are creative for the students to use.  Basically, this unit is trying to get away from memorization, facts, questions and is geared towards a more helpful way of teaching the circulatory system by using creative, hands-on activities.
