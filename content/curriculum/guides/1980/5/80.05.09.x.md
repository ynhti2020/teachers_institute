<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.05.09:
</h4>
This unit provides a framework for teachers who are considering incorporating a sex education course into their existing science or social studies curriculum.  An overview of the period, Early Adolescence, is presented.  The bibliography includes useful and appropriate materials which should be read and considered thoroughly before the unit is introduced.  All films and classroom materials are reasonably available; previewing all materials is a must.  Sample lessons include: Social Development - Sex Roles (Gender Identity); Physiological Changes - puberty; and, Pregnancy and Birth.
