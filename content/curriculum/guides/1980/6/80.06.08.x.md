The unit deals with the culture, history and government of Puerto Rico.  It also introduces an outlook on the political involvement and participation of Puerto Ricans in New Haven, Connecticut.  In order to have a better understanding of Puerto Rican participation in politics, one should have some knowledge of Puerto Rican history.  History and culture alike shape the political attitudes.  The unit will focus on the political agencies which indirectly affect the attitudes of the Puerto Ricans.  It is designed to cover five school days, and may be adapted for a high school history or current events class in grades 11 or 12.
