<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.06.03:
</h4>
This unit hopes to open the minds of students on the importance of making a decision.  The five steps in making a decision will be explored in this unit.  Minor and major decisions will be discussed. The difference between the two will be defined.  Students will learn how a value has a great deal to do with the type of decision they will make in life.  Lesson Plans are given in this unit so students can actually make a decision and be questioned on why they chose a particular alternative over another.  Knowing what an alternative is and how to apply different alternatives in different situations will be discussed.
