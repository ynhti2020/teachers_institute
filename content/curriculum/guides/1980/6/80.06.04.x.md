<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.06.04:
</h4>
I tried to develop a unit that would be teachable.  I mean something that would be successful in the classroom.  After much consideration, I chose music as an enticement to get students interested in my teaching the unit.  I think once I get their interest, the vocabulary skills, listening skills, reading concentration, etc.  will follow.  I have tried to select material that has worked for me in some way or the other in the past.  I tried to select artists that the students would enjoy, not necessarily the ones that the experts of the periods suggest.  The lesson plans are quite flexible and will allow alterations to suit any particular ethnic group.
