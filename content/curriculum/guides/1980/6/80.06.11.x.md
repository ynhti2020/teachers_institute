<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.06.11:
</h4>
This unit focuses on the criminal justice system: Its development, function, and proposals for reform.  The unit’s specific focus is plea-bargaining.  Students become aware of the dynamics of plea-bargaining through readings, visits to Superior Court and the Yale Library, and classroom activities.  The activities include a mock trial which compares the results of plea-bargaining with the trial’s results.  The unit attempts to build and develop research skills by integrating these skills with cognitive and affective objectives.  The unit is designed for advanced high school students.
