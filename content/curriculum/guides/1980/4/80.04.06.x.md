<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.04.06:
</h4>
Do you love teaching?  have you ever found yourself liking something and yet being terribly frustrated by it?  If teaching is that special something that you like but you are experiencing frustration, this unit is for you.  Research has shown that students who present most discipline problems are those who cannot read.  Since our entire educational structure is based on reading, then the student with reading problems will almost certainly be an academic failure.  As a result, he will either drop out of school or stay in and be a nuisance.  This is why I have devoted my entire project to researching techniques for motivating these “turned-off,” “tuned-out” students to read.
