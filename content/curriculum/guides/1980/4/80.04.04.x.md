<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.04.04:
</h4>
In this unit we have shown how the teacher can divide and conquer by providing skills for the students who are slow learners or reluctant readers.  We have taken phonics and divided it into different categories and broken it down into the smallest meaningful units.  We must utilize new materials and new approaches, for if we do not the program will be geared for failure.  The search for new materials for the slow learner and reluctant reader must always continue.  As time progresses we can gradually get into a more structured curriculum program.
