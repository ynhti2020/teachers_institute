<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.02.07:
</h4>
“Early Man in North America” is developed as an approach to the study of early man.  The unit incorporates art and material culture, science and social studies.  “Early Man” deals with the science called New Archaeology, which sees culture as a link between behavioral patterns and material items.  The culture that a society develops therefore, is the direct result of the way humans learn to cope with their environment.  Along with the written text there are thirteen transparencies which illustrate maps, charts, graphs, diagrams, and drawings.
