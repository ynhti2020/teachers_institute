<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.01.07:
</h4>
This unit, to be used in the seventh grade, is an eight week study of France.  Its aim is to help Middle School teachers of Italian, Spanish, or German when they are expected to spend a semester introducing France to their students.  The poetry of Victor Hugo and the short stories of Guy de Maupassant are highlighted.  Because not all teachers of this unit will be familiar with France, I have included appendices devoted to geography, history, and vocabulary.
