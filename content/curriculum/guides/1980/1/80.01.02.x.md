<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.01.02:
</h4>
This unit was developed for highly motivated third or fourth year Spanish students or for native Spanish speakers.  It is a guide to be used for teaching Latin-American literature, especially the novel “Dona Barbara,” by Romulo Gallegos.  It includes an outline which covers the geography of Venezuela and the rest of Latin America, history, a sample Spanish vocabulary list including Venezuelan idioms, an introduction to the culture, a summary of the plot of “Dona Barbara,” and a skit based on the story.  The unit provides many insights and an excellent opportunity for students to practice and even master the Spanish language.
