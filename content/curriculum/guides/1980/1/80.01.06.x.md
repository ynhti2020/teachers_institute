<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.01.06:
</h4>
This unit is designed for high school students who are low-level readers.  It consists of five new young adult novels and activities for use with each.  There is also an annotated bibliography of additional novels that could be included in such a unit.  The unit can cover a full school year or can be used as a mini-course for better readers.
