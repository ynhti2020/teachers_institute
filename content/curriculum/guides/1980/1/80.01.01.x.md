<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.01.01:
</h4>
My unit consists of an informal introduction to a major literary work, “Don Quixote.”  Many facets of the novel will be discussed.  The students will learn some biographical facts of the life of Miguel Cervantes and about knight-errantry and chivalry as it existed during medieval times.  An overview of the history and geography of Spain (and of southwestern Europe) will be introduced, and, finally, acquaintance with the novel will help develop Spanish vocabulary and grammatical skills.
