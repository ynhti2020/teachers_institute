<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.07.10:
</h4>
This unit is intended for use with middle school students, but may be easily adapted for use in the elementary and high schools.  The unit discusses a variety of strategies that may be used in math problem solving, and provides illustrative examples of how these strategies may be used.  For the teacher who may want to make math problem solving a part of what (s)he teaches throughout the year, this unit will provide the basic development of a solid program.  The unit is accompanied by a kit of materials that are available through the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute.  These materials include commercially available materials, as well as task cards prepared by the author.  Many of these materials are available through Harry Levitin, math supervisor.
