<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.07.12:
</h4>
This four to six week unit is meant for use with college-bound high school students.  The unit combines the introduction of chemistry with a methodical method of problem solving and a review of the mathematics needed for high school chemistry.  It includes the vocabulary used in describing the physical properties of matter, the metric system and decimals, a progression of problems dealing with the derived quantities of density and heat, and the calculation of percentage of error.  It is hoped that by integrating chemistry and mathematics in this way, the student will see an immediate practical application for his math skills and will thus be motivated to begin using them outside of math class.
