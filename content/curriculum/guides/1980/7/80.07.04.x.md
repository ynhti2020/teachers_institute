<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.07.04:
</h4>
“Logic and Set Theory” is designed to offer teachers and children a chance to explore what may be to them a different area of Finite Mathematics.  The unit offers an introduction to the basic concepts and symbols of Logic and Set Theory and provides exercises in these two areas.  Problem solving in all areas of mathematics requires the ability to reason and to form valid conclusions.  Logic and Set theory will aid students in proving the equivalence of statements as well as in solving problems.  Some of the ideas introduced in the unit include types of statements, truth tables, and Venn Diagrams, as well as the language of Logic and Set Theory.
