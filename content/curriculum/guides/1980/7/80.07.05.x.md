<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.07.05:
</h4>
Our unit is a structured technique to aid any teacher in teaching the solving of word problems in their math classes, heuristically.  The method, as the title suggests, is rather simple, consisting of four steps.  It can be taught to any class that solves word problems.  We suggest, however, that this method be taught early in the school year.  We also point out many difficulties students face at the high school level.  These include reading habits, motivation, and poor text books.  We discuss how we deal (or plan on dealing) with these difficulties.  Motivational suggestions are also included.
