<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.07.02:
</h4>
This unit is designed to help students gain insight into problem solving through hands-on materials based upon careers.  This unit focuses on six careers through visitations to local businesses and one out-of-state trip.  Speakers and on-the-job training will also be utilized as well as classroom activities.  A pre- and post-test will be given to all students to determine their ability and progress in problem solving.  One of the purposes is to guide the studentsâ€™ thinking to help make decisions.  It is hoped that the learner will not only develop problem solving skills, but take a critical look at himself/herself in this ever-changing and complex society of ours.
