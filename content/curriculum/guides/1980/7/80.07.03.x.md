<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.07.03:
</h4>
This paper contains some of my thoughts on problem solving.  In it I show you the reader how my class and I try to solve problems.  The solutions range from the easy one to the harder ones.  Sketches are presented as they might be found on my blackboard.  The paper is part me and part the student, sometimes itâ€™s hard to tell us apart.
