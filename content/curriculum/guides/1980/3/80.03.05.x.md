<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.03.05:
</h4>
Our unit on dramatic dialogue or script writing is designed to help students write more effectively.  It is also designed to enable students to use script writing as a means of confronting and working toward a solution of dilemmas in their daily lives.  We lean heavily on Viola Spolin and draw on the events from studentsâ€™ lives as we take them from oral speech to the more formalized process of script writing.
