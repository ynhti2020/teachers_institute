<h4>
Guide Entry to 80.03.01:
</h4>
This unit should prove useful in any course on Shakespeare, Elizabethan theater or World theater as a model for teaching plays not merely as dramatic literature but as a theatrical script that can be staged in the classroom.  I suggest various theater games and warm-up activities for Christopher Marlowe’s “Doctor Faustus” that can allow students to connect to the underlying emotional content of the play. I discuss them in terms of how they relate to individual soliloquies, specific scenes and the whole play; how they fit in with some of the themes of “Doctor Faustus;” and how to best do them in class—what to watch out for, what has worked for me.  The goal is to introduce students to a fascinating play in a manner that conveys the excitement of experiencing it as theater.  (“Doctor Faustus,” by the way, is an excellent companion piece to “Macbeth.”)
