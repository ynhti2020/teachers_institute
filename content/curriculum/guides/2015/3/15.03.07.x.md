This curriculum unit, focused on the physics and chemistry of the Earth’s atmosphere and climate, will foster the creation of more global students and citizens capable of making informed decisions about our planet. This unit envisions transformational change by impacting all areas of my students’ lives, from academic growth to problem-solving and career development. Academically, students will gain exposure to real-world scientific connections. They will engage in cutting-edge work of the discipline, through topics such as the balance of thermal energy from the sun, the ozone layer, and the effects of increasing carbon dioxide levels. The problem-solving aspect will see my students, like scientists, practice thinking critically and creatively about problems that relate to the world around them and other fields of science and mathematics. Finally, this unit will provide students with a deeper understanding of STEM careers and hopefully spark their interest in pursuing a degree in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics to show others the importance of protecting Earth so it can continue to protect us.
