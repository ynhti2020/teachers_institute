In many educational settings around the United States there are classes where Native American histories are overlooked or under-taught for various reasons. My curriculum unit tries to combat the absence of these histories within the classroom, and to bring to life the various tribes in this country whose histories have been omitted or underappreciated. The main objective of this unit is to allow students an opportunity to examine various tribes’ cultures, languages, societies, interactions with settlers, and advances made over the years. The purpose of this analysis will be to show students that even though many textbooks and curricula across the nation may have exchanged native history with other topics in the curriculum, there is still a rich history and continuing legacy. The unit consists of primary and secondary source analysis along with class discussions and group assignments. The unit will culminate with the students working in small groups in order to create their own textbook entry on a Native American tribe or region of their choice. My overall goal will be to open students’ minds to the fact that even though Native American histories may be too often missing, they are not forgotten.
