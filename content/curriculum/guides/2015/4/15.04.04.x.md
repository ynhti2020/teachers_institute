This unit will teach students the molecular difference between natural sugar and artificial sweeteners. Students throughout the unit will be able to explore and evaluate the effects each of these has on the human body. Students will be able to compare and contrast the substancesâ€™ chemical make-up. Students will be able to build structural models of their chosen sweeteners in order to give others the opportunity to see their results.

Currently students enter the class with a basic understanding of the digestive system as well as the six basic nutrients and how they assist in our everyday bodily functions. It is my hope within this unit to teach students to delve more deeply into analyzing what we are placing into our bodies. We will research the questions: Is it safe to eat? How much should we be eating? And, of course, which should we consume to maximize our health?
