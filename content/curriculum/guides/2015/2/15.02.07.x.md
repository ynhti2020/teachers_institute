This is a marking-period-long, reading and writing unit designed for middle-school students, primarily in the sixth grade, but can be modified and adapted to fit high-school curriculum, grades nine through twelve. Students will be challenged to research, read, and write about yellow fever and its origins at the turn of the century, using a wide array of multimedia resources that will include literature, music, visual arts, and technology to help enhance studentsâ€™ background knowledge of what the world was like in the 1900s. It is the intent of the unit for students to gain background knowledge of the culture of this period in order to better understand and make connections with the text. The unit will engage all the readers, writers, and thinkers in your classroom who are willing to be transported to circa 1900 and explore Cuba, old-fashioned scientific laboratories, and most importantly, witness transformation of women. Would you be willing to risk your life for science?
