This unit teaches art appreciation by taking a deeper look into art history, focusing on modern art of the 20th century and influences that American culture had on art and the artists who were creating it. Aims for the lessons include being able to form objective opinions about modern art, making connections to contemporary culture discovered within art subjects, creating a painting project where students apply critical thinking, and exploring and collecting various forms of media to learn from and then utilize in student research. The unit aligns with the National Arts Education Standards and achieves all eleven Anchor Standards. The influences of Technology, Mass Media and Industry on artists George Bellows, Joseph Stella, Aaron Douglas, Norman Rockwell, Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol are bridged together to teach students understanding of modern art as well as lessons on processes and techniques for a painting assessment.
