<h4>
Guide Entry to 92.02.05:
</h4>
The unit “Rediscovering the Aztec Indians” is geared toward third and fourth graders. This unit can be used to teach Social Studies, or as a way to teach content-based foreign language. The aspects that are covered on the Aztecs are: cooking, food, the arts, and their way of life. Also includes a set of slides to be used in conjunction with the unit. This unit, a part of a curriculum that is being developed called “Sharing Our Language Through Culture,” also includes a set of slides.
<p>
The unit proposes that the language teacher implement a method which I have named “The Process Approach.” The method is a “see it, say it, do it” approach for teaching foreign language, using multi-sensory, multi-media methods. Hands-on activities are also suggested in the lessons.
