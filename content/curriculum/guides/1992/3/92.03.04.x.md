<h4>
Guide Entry to 92.03.04:
</h4>
This unit is a multicultural study of three cities in existence in the latter half of the fifteenth century.  It is designed for fourth and fifth grade students in the Talented and Gifted Program.  It looks at many aspects of city life in Florence, Italy; Tenochtitlan, Mexico; and Timbuktu, Africa.  The unit begins with a discussion of the definition of a city, and then moves into a study of each of the three cities.  Topics covered include family life, government, religion, art and architecture.  While studying each city, comparisons are made not only with each other, but with city life in the fifteenth century and city life now.  Additional emphasis is placed on geography and map work.
