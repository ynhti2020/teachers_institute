<h4>
Guide Entry to 92.03.06:
</h4>
This unit contains reading and writing assignments based on city life.  They are intended to improve students’ sensitivity to and awareness of the issues that impact them and their lives growing up in New Haven. In addition, my intention is to improve students’ writing by letting them write about what they know and what they see.  They are to become intelligent and thoughtful observers and listeners.
