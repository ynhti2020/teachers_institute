In anatomy, form and function of sensory organs allows students to understand how the body interacts with external stimuli.  Explorations of the eye and ear often lack a full exploration of the physical science phenomena behind them.  In this unit, both the eye and ear are explored as receptors for wave phenomena of light and sound.  The interaction between anatomy and physical science provides a robust understanding of how the body functions.  In addition to a brief study of waves, students will also explore medical interventions such as the bionic eye, glasses, hearing aids, and cochlear implants as ways to improve our ability to sense sight and sound.
