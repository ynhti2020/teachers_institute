In this unit we will discuss and learn about how batteries work their relation to the field of robotics.  We will study the different types of batteries, their differences and their uses. We will also briefly look at the history of batteries and a timeline of different events in the field of batteries.  Students will set up and conduct experiments, which will span days to weeks.  During this time other units and lessons can be taught.  On the conclusion of the experiments the students will recap the lesson and conclude the unit.  This unit will be tied into students’ Chemistry courses allowing a better understanding of the chemical reaction that goes into the operation of a battery.  This will be tied into students’ math skills and digital media as they will be making small mathematical calculations and viewing video footage.
