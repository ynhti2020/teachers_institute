This unit is based on the fourth-grade core text,
<em>
Yolonda's Genius
</em>
, by Carol Fenner.  It intends to connect the core text to the general music curriculum and focus on responding and expressing identity through music.  Students will concentrate on the responding and connecting processes from the National Core Arts Standards.  Students will spend time exploring the identity of Andrew, the young boy in the novel who cannot read and barely speaks, but creates incredible music with his harmonica.  Students will then create what they believe Andrew's music sounds like, and use what they learn about Andrew's creative process and the musical elements to create an original composition based on their own identity. This unit would work best if the General Music teacher works together with the fourth-grade Language Arts teacher.
