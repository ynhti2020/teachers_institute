<h4>
Guide Entry to 83.05.08:
</h4>
This unit offers another supplemental approach to the middle school geography teacher: the use of both poetry and drama that has an association with journeys, weather, people in distant places, resources, beauty, and time, among other things.  A number of poems are suggested for classroom use: some are familiar, some are not; some of the poems are serious, some are not.  The poems are recommended for various kinds of readings, and also in conjunction with other geography class uses.
<p>
Four plays are recommended for use and described:
</p>
<p>
The Swamp Dweller (Nigeria) by Wole Soyinka A Marriage Proposal (U.S.S.R.) by Anton Chekhov Spreading The News (Ireland) by Lady Gregory The Big Wave (Japan) by Pearl Buck
</p>
<p>
As with the poems, some suggestions are made for activities to correlate with the dramas.
