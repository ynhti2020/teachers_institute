<h4>
Guide Entry to 83.02.06:
</h4>
This unit has been written to teach students an appreciation for and an enjoyment of mythology.  Mythology is read as an end in itself and not as a stepping-stone to something else.  I will start with the creation mythology and compare the Greek gods with those of other cultures.  The unit discusses the Olympian gods, the creation of man, the Prometheus and Pandora myths.  The students will also read on their own and report to the class about a particular god or goddess they have studied.  From the study of the gods, the unit moves on to discuss heroes.  Class readings will include Herakles, Orpheus and Daedalus.  Students will be expected to read individually from the adventures of other heroes and to report to the class.
