<h4>
Guide Entry to 83.02.11:
</h4>
This unit has been created to supplement the curricula of social studies as well as urban studies classes by introducing Greek and Roman mythology readings in order to increase the studentsâ€™ vocabulary and comprehension skills; encouraging students to become more observant and appreciative of the world around them, especially the influence of mythology in the world today; helping students in gaining further understanding of the process of decision by representation; encouraging use of library facilities by increasing the amount of research in Greek and Roman mythology; reinforcing map skills by locating mythological places; and pinpointing the way sex-role stereotypes were conceptualized by the Greeks and the Romans in mythology.
