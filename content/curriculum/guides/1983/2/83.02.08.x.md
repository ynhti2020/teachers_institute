<h4>
Guide Entry to 83.02.08:
</h4>
This unit is designed for ninth grade students who are reading four or five years below grade level.  These students enjoy reading aloud and have vivid imaginations.  They often keep each other enthralled with their much embellished stories of out-of school events.  The reading, telling, retelling and writing of myths and folktales will help these students use talents they already have and help them improve writing, oral presentation, and group participation skills.
