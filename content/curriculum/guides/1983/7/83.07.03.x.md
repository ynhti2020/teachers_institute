<h4>
Guide Entry to 83.07.03:
</h4>
This unit will cover the atomic basis of radiology, including the structure of the atom, formation of X-rays, the effect of X-rays on living tissues and film, as well as fluoroscopy.
<p>
It supplements Joyce Calarcoâ€™s unit on the historical development of cathode ray tubes, as well as the unit by Marcella Flake and Carolyn Kinder which deals with the subject of radiology and safety, on a middle school level.
</p>
<p>
Only by understanding the basic structures and physics of the atom can we appreciate the processes of radiology.
