<h4>
Guide Entry to 90.04.04:
</h4>
This unit covers the Puerto Rican family emigrants to New Haven, the Puerto Rican family in New Haven, and their involvement in this city’s life. With this unit I hope to bring my students to an ample knowledge of the Puerto Rican family before its emigration to the United States, its components and everyone’s role as members of a family. This unit discusses why families move from one country to another looking for better living conditions, how they adopt parts of the new culture, and how families and countries go through changes over time. This unit contains a brief study of the New Haven Green, Wooster Place, and some famous Puerto Rican people, including people from the Puerto Rican community in New Haven at the present time.
