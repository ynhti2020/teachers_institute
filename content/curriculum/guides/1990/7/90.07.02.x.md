<h4>
Guide Entry to 90.07.02:
</h4>
The unit focuses on problem solving through real life situations that involve aviation. For more than eighty years men and women have been designing and building airplanes in an amazing variety of shapes and sizes. In spite of the shapes and sizes all airplanes fly in the same way, and the problems of the aviation industry are basically the same. Some of the problems in this unit deal with the tests that have already been in the United States by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Federal Aviation Agency, and by the Department of Defense. These tests were done in order to ensure safety, convenience, and efficiency in this swift and powerful aviation world of ours.
