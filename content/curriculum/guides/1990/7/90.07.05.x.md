<h4>
Guide Entry to 90.07.05:
</h4>
The topic is flight. I knew little about flight and the men and women who made it possible. Others were probably in the same position. To correct this I did a short history of events which led to flight. I was only interested in getting the reader to fly. In looking at the other writings, I still did not know much about the real causes of flight, so I did a part of my paper on this to teach the teachers. I showed four paper airplane books in hopes that my fellow teachers will look at them and use the models which are found within their pages to demonstrate flight. “Hands-on” is a good way to learn. I took a trip to the Connecticut air museum but was not impressed. I learned by reading.
