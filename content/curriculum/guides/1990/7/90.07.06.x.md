<h4>
Guide Entry to 90.07.06:
</h4>
This unit contains the history of the aerospace. The aerospace industry is one of the most powerful industries in the United States. It encompasses a worldwide complex of manufacturers who produce airplanes, helicopters, military aircraft, missiles, rockets, spacecraft, and satellites. These manufacturers employ a vast number of supplier firms that make a variety of products ranging from avionics and hydraulic systems to rubber gaskets and adhesives.
<p>
The history of aerospace begins in 1256 with Roger Bacon and his “liquid fire” to the present with the spacecraft. The unit discusses the careers that are included in the aerospace industry. Included with this are the possibilities for both women and minorities in the field. There is a discussion about the effects that the aerospace industry have on the U.S. economy. In connection with this, I researched the strides that other countries such as Japan and West Germany are making in this aerospace industry. Finally, this unit deals with the effects of the aerospace industry on our own state economy.
