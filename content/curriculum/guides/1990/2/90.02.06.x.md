<h4>
Guide Entry to 90.02.06:
</h4>
The development of this unit will take one full school year. The students will learn behavioral problem-solving skills that promote successful strategies for coping with stressful situations. The three main units are stress management, six problem-solving steps, and behavioral social skills. This is followed by a substance use prevention module.
<p>
Students will compile a problem diary that will be used to generate a list of ideas for a subject to write about. At the appropriate time students will be assigned to groups who will compare and discuss their diaries and then select a subject for the writing project. Students at all ability levels can benefit from this unit. Teachers will find that students will work with little difficulty.
