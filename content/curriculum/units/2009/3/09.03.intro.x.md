Every child is a natural scientist.  Every kitchen is a laboratory in disguise.  Our seminar explored these ideas to develop approaches for teaching science to students in elementary and middle school.
</p>
<p>
The units we developed are far-reaching and fun.  As a group, we placed special emphasis on the development of hands-on classroom activities using materials and tools found in the kitchen.
</p>
<p>
Some of our units are focused on the science of food.  How is candy made?  How do micro-organisms help us make food?
</p>
<p>
Some units are focused on teaching basic scientific principles using examples from the kitchen.  What is the scientific method?  What are solids and liquids and why are some materials hard to classify? What are the differences between igneous and sedimentary rock?
</p>
<p>
Other units take a broader view and use food and cooking as a means to introduce students to new cultures and careers.
</p>
<p>
Along the way, our discussions were supported by Harold McGee's delightful text
