Like the units published under thin title in 1978 and 1979, these curricula show great diversity: their authors teach students at different stages of development, focus on different problems, and suggest markedly different approaches. Still, the volume finds a principle of unity in the urgency of the problems it addresses. Everyone knows that language skills are vital to economic and personal survival, yet American students continue to show shocking deficiencies in those skills, and the New Haven schools are no exception. These units, worked out in the open exchange of a lively seminar, informed by common and special reading, and testes in part in the classroom itself, indicate some strategies teachers can employ in the critical struggle to motivate and improve reading, speaking, and writing.
