The topic of our seminar “Problem Solving” can be interpreted to encompass virtually any mathematical activity. These units range from the everyday, but important, problem of computing sales tax to the exotic, but important, problem of the motion of the moon. I am certain that a teacher of any grade or ability level will find these units interesting and stimulating.
