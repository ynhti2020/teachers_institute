Introduction
</h2>
Statistics play a role in all our lives. From time to time we provide data or collect data to be organized, analyzed, and used in making decisions. For example, the registrar of vital statistics records our date of birth and our date of death. Periodically we are counted in the population census taken by the federal government. School children are always concerned about their scholastic averages. When planning vacations we are interested in data provided by the weather bureau. We try to predict the outcome of elections by analyzing the results of political polls that have been taken. Business people conduct surveys to find out what products are most frequently sought by consumers. Sports fans compare batting averages, wins and losses of various teams. Although our list could continue indefinitely, it is sufficient to say that we encounter statistics in many facets of our lives, and all school children should be introduced to basic statistical terms and concepts.
In this unit of study we will try to improve the students’ understanding of the elementary topics included in statistics. The unit will clearly define the arithmetic mean, the median, the mode and the range of a group of numbers. Methods for computing these measures of central tendency will be discussed. Frequency tables, histograms and frequency polygons will be explained and constructed. Following the explanation of each topic, a set of practice exercises will be included.
<p>
There are several basic objectives for this unit of study. Upon completion of the unit, the student will be able to:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
— understand and appreciate the use of statistics in everyday life.
<dt>
— define basic terms used in statistics.
<dt>
— compute simple measures of central tendency.
<dt>
— construct tables, bar graphs and line graphs that display these measures of central tendency.
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>
The material developed here may be used at the following levels of instruction: (1) in seventh or eighth grade arithmetic classes; (2) in high school applied mathematics classes; (3) in high school consumer mathematics classes; (4) in adult basic education classes.
<h3>
<i>
Arithmetic
</i>
<i>
Mean
</i>
</h3>
The
<i>
arithmetic
</i>
<i>
mean
</i>
is another name for the average of a set of measures. To calculate the arithmetic mean, add the members of the set and divide the sum by the number of items in the set.
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>
Example 1
</i>
: Find the arithmetic mean of the following set of numbers: 15, 10, 12, 18, 20.
<dt>
<i>
Solution
</i>
: (15+ 10+ 12+18+20) $dv$ 5 = 75 $dv$ 5 = 15 The arithmetic mean is 15.
<dt>
<i>
Example
</i>
<i>
2
</i>
: On four English tests John received grades of 92,80, 88, 94. What grade must he receive on the next test if he wishes to maintain an average of 90?
<dt>
<i>
Solution
</i>
: If John wishes to have an average of 90 on five tests, the sum of his scores on the five tests must be 5 x 90 or 450. His total score on the first four tests is 92+80+88 + 94 or 354. He must receive 450 354 or 96 on the fifth test to maintain an average of 90 on the five tests.
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>
Sometimes an item appears in a set of measures more than once. The number of times any item occurs in the set is its
<i>
frequency
</i>
. To find the arithmetic mean of a set of measures when some items occur several times, multiply each item in the set by its frequency and divide the sum of these products by the total number of items in the set.
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>
Example
</i>
: Find the arithmetic mean of the following numbers: 8, 6, 10, 11, 12, 6, 6, 8, 14, 15, 14, 14, 10, 12, 6, 11.
</dt>

Sum of Products:
<p>
24+ 16+ 20+ 22+24+ 42+30+20 = 198
</p>
<p>
Total Number of Items:
</p>
<p>
4+2+2+2+2+3+2+1 = 18
</p>
<p>
Sum of Products $dv$ Total Number of Items:
</p>
<p>
198 $dv$ 18 = 11
</p>
<p>
The arithmetic mean is 11.

<h3>
<i>
Median
</i>
</h3>
When the elements of a set of numbers have been arranged in ascending order, the number located in the middle of the set is the
<i>
median
</i>
of the set. The median divides the set of data into two equal parts. To determine which element of a set is the middle number, use the following formula:
Middle Number (Total Number of Elements + 1). Ö $ 2
If the set contains an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<i>
Example
</i>
<i>
1
</i>
: Seven students received the following scores on an examination: 100, 04, 62, 95, 73, 71, 88. Find the median score.
<dt>
<i>
Solution
</i>
: Arrange the scores in order from lowest to highest: 62, 71, 73, 84, 88, 95, 100.
<dt>
(7+ 1) $dv$ 2 = 0 $dv$ 2 = 4. The fourth number of the set is the middle number. The median of the set is 84.
<dt>
<i>
Example
</i>
<i>
2
</i>
: Eight workers received the following hourly wages: $5.50, $3.75, $6.00, $4.25, $8.50, $3.90, $7.85, $4.80. What is the median wage?
<dt>
Solution: Arrange the wages in ascending order: $3.75, $3.90, $4.25, $4.80, $5.50 , $6.00, $7.85, $8.50.
<dt>
(8+ 1) $dv$ 2 = 9 = 2 = 4.5 The two middle numbers of the set are the fourth and fifth numbers. $4.80 and $5.50.
<dt>
($4.80 + $5.50) $dv$ 2 = $10.30 $dv$ 2 = $5.15
<dt>
The median wage is $5.15.

<h3>

Range

</h3>
The
<i>
mode
</i>
of a set of numbers is the element that appears most frequently in the set. There can be more than one mode in a set of numbers. A set that has two modes is
<i>
bimodal
</i>
. One that has three modes is
<i>
trimodal
</i>
. If no element of a set appears more often than any other element, the set has no mode. The mode is an important measure for business people. It tells them what items are most popular with consumers.

<h3>

Histogram
</i>
</h3>
The frequency of a set of numbers can be represented graphically on a histogram. A
<i>
histogram
</i>
is a bar graph on which the bars are adjacent to each other with no space between them. To construct a histogram, arrange the data in equal intervals. Represent each interval on the horizontal axis of the graph. Represent the frequency of items in the interval on the vertical axis of the graph.
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>

</i>
<dt>
Example: The number of students in twenty-five classes of a high school are as follows: 15, 27, 22, 18, 10, 25, 27, 12, 19, 26, 14, 12, 22, 20 21, 17, 21, 20, 13, 12, 22, 27, 21, 17, 27. Arrange the class sizes in intervals and construct a histogram depicting the number of classes in each interval.

<h3>

Frequency
</i>
<i>
Polygon
</i>
</h3>
A frequency
<i>
polygon
</i>
is a line graph which can be used to represent the frequency of a set of numbers. It is formed by connecting a series of points. The abscissa of each point is the midpoint of the interval in which the point lies. The ordinate of each point is the frequency for the interval. The polygon is closed at each end by drawing a line from the endpoints to the horizontal axis at the midpoint of the next interval.
