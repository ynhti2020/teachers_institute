Because of the range of interests among the Fellows, it was agreed in the course of two meetings of the full group to divide it into three working groups: one dealing with issues in American domestic affairs and led by Assistant Professor Richard W. Fox, one focusing on aspects of American foreign policy and led by Professor Henry A. Turner, the third concentrating on the feminine experience as revealed in various forms of literature and led by Lecturer Cynthia E. Russett. The seminars were conducted within the framework of these working groups, which permitted each fellow to present drafts of his or her curriculum unit for extensive criticism and suggestions by the others. The result was a high level of interchange between the fellows of each working group.
