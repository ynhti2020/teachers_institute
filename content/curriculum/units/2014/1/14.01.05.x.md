Introduction
</h2>
<p>
How did you learn to speak? How did you begin to understand your parents' first commands? You probably didn't spend eighty five minutes every other day in a classroom until you got it. It was most likely a natural progression. From your first words, to the first time you asked for milk or water, to the first time you wrote your name correctly was an eventuality because your entire world was such a constant barrage of auditory and visual stimuli that your brain had no choice but to create meaning from it. That was my experience, and yours too. My stimulus was always in Spanish, yours… it could be any language, but we both still learned our first language, and we learned it well, evidence provided by the fact I am able to write this unit and you are able to read and use it. So if the majority of us learn our first language so well, why do so many of us have such difficulty learning a second language? Does our brain forget how to learn language? Is learning a second language fundamentally different than learning our first? How can we as World Language teachers tap into how we learned our first languages, and avoid using translation to teach students a new language?
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
In writing this unit I addressed the subject of language acquisition without the use of translation for my unit topic for the Yale New Haven Teacher's Institute because I wanted to find out the best way to continuously link language to an idea through image rather than translation. Most students would think that the easiest and fastest way to learn a new language is direct translation. Many people have become very fluent through years of hard work and dedication, but since 1982 most professionals follow the proficiency guidelines of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL), according to which direct translation is not the best way to go. Proficiency in a foreign language can be acquired without translation through the use of simple and complex images.
</p>
<p>
We all have the ability to speak at least one language fluently. Most of us, excluding those with severe disabilities, learn how to speak naturally as toddlers as we grow. However, few of us ever become bilingual or trilingual. There are many differences between learning one's mother tongue and learning another language in a classroom. In fact, according to ACTFL, students who reach and pass AP Spanish should be at only the fifth (out of ten) level of proficiency, which is Intermediate-Mid. Why is it so difficult for so many students to learn a second language? How can teachers maximize how much students learn in a short amount of time? How can we use pictures and images to teach more than just colors, actions, and objects?
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Background: Who Am I and Whom Do I Teach?
</h2>
<p>
In this curriculum unit I explore the different schools of thought on the percentage of target language that should be used during instruction in a World Language classroom, as well as take a look at how the brain actually learns language and how learning more than one language can affect other areas of learning. Next I share some research on how images can be used to teach language, and finally I share my conclusions on language learning and what teachers can do to help students understand not just what they are learning, but how their brains are actually learning the material.
</p>
<p>
As World Language teachers, we try to do several things throughout the course of a class. In most states we use the national standards that go with the five C's: Communication, Culture, Comparisons, Community, and Connections. New Haven Public Schools like to focus on professional development on just one or two of these areas each year.  This year it has been Communication. There are three types of communication. Interpersonal communication involves individuals talking back and forth, and this now includes texting. Presentational communication is about producing the language, and Interpretative communication is about comprehending the language, listening, and reading. Additionally, there are four modes of communication: reading, writing, listening, and speaking. When foreign language teachers are teaching, we are trying to hit all five C's as well as the four modes. It can be overwhelming, especially since many students feel as if learning a language is too difficult, and they are never motivated.
</p>
<p>
In my unit I attempt to teach only through the use of 100% target language and images. I think that if I eliminate the crutch of translation from the very beginning, and find a way for the students to be willing to grapple with the difficulty curve, the students will begin to understand how their brains learn and retain information, and including a lesson about just that subject will create a new dynamic in the classroom. Not only will students be learning a new language, but they will be consciously practicing to learn in general because they will be aware of how brains work. I already use pictures to teach many things, however, through my research I have found out how to use images for more complex ideas, even using pictures for grammar.
</p>
<p>
One of the major things that differentiates New Haven from the other school districts is the sheer number of Magnet Schools. Hyde School of Health Science and Sports Medicine is one of those schools. The school changed from a Leadership Program to a Health Science school just a few years ago, and it was not given a curriculum – a challenging position to say the least. As a high school Spanish teacher at a New Haven magnet school, I am always looking for ways to engage my students in the theme of our magnet as it relates to Medical Spanish concepts. Each year I work to write units taught through a health science lens and I have found that the Yale New Haven Teacher's Institute is an excellent way to collaborate with colleagues and experts in the field to write engaging and relevant units for my students. This year, as a participant in the "Picture Writing" seminar, I am focusing on developing a unit for my Spanish 1 and Spanish 2 students that uses images and not translation of any kind to teach vocabulary and grammatical concepts.
</p>
<p>
In the summer of 2012, I went through Connecticut's Alternate Route for Certification Program for World Languages with a cohort of 13 other future teachers. One of the main questions we aimed to tackle that summer was "What amount of target language is too much when teaching an introductory class?" It was a question that we all had opinions on, and one that our professors couldn't answer definitively. We all came to agree that language immersion, when you are experiencing only that particular language, is the best way to become fluent and master a language. For example, when a person who is learning Spanish moves to Costa Rica for 6 months, he or she will have gotten much more proficient in Spanish through sheer exposure. But, how much language does one need to become immersed and not submerged? Can students get to a place of proficiency using only the target language so that they can then go immerse themselves in a new setting? Some students will surely travel to a Spanish speaking country; however, the majority of them will never get that opportunity. As community members of New Haven, which has a very high population of Latinos, we would find it interesting to be able to walk down the street and communicate in Spanish at any of the various businesses in Fair Haven. In addition, those students who reach a certain level of proficiency in Spanish and in Health Science or Sports Medicine skills are at a distinct advantage when looking to enter the field.
</p>
<p>
An example. During one of our many ARC sessions, the professor wanted to make a point about teaching only in the target language. The languages represented in our session ranged from Spanish, German, Chinese, and few others, so the professor decided to do a Swahili lesson. It's safe to assume none of us in the session had been exposed to Swahili before. He began with a prop. It was the toddler toy with different size and colored rings that you can stack on a stand. He slowly took each ring one by one and saying a word in Swahili, going back and forth and reviewing constantly. It became very clear very quickly that he was teaching us colors in Swahili, and after ten minutes, each of us fourteen could identify the colors with some proficiency. Our professor did not speak English one time during this lesson, which he pointed out during our debriefing. His conclusion: we can teach in only the target language.
</p>
<p>
While I appreciated this example and can use this same method to teach colors, I still felt like that was taking the easy way. It is easy to teach colors in the target language, just have different colors of the same thing, like his rings, point and speak, and repeat. There are still many questions about this that didn't go answered. How do we go from teaching simple concepts like colors, to more complex ones like grammar, tenses, and abstract ideas like "truth" and "freedom" using only the target language to teach?

<h2>
Rationale: Changing Vews on Target Language Only
</h2>
<p>
According to ACTFL, World Language teachers should use the target language anywhere from 90% to 100% of the time. In my personal experience, doing this on a consistent basis has been very difficult. A study conducted by Peter Dickson from the National Foundation for Educational research has outlined several factors that could possibly deter teachers' use of the target language. The categories are as follows: disorderly behavior, lower achieving students, large classes, mixed ability classes, your own fatigue, your views on target language use, your confidence teaching a foreign language if said language is not your native language, department policy, and your confidence (1
<sup>
<sup>
st
</sup>
</sup>
foreign language). Dickson created a questionnaire that 504 language teachers answered for each of these categories on how they rated it affected negatively their use of the target language in the classroom ranging from very much, quite a lot, a bit, and not at all.
</p>
<p>
It comes as no surprise that the three categories in which the greatest number of teachers selected very much or quite a lot were 1. disorderly behavior, 2. lower achieving students, and 3. mixed ability classrooms.
<sup>
<sup>
1
</sup>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
At my school, these three factors are prevalent in all of my classes. Last year, our school had the highest percentage of suspensions in the district. In the last ten years, only two students have been able to pass an AP exam. And in my Spanish classes, I have some students who are in twelfth grade in Spanish 2 who took Spanish 1 three years ago in ninth grade among tenth grade students who finished Spanish 1 just months before. I am not using these statistics as excuses for why I cannot remain in target language, only to highlight the reasons I want to answer the questions I posed in the introduction of this paper.
</p>
<p>
For me, the most significant obstacle has been mixed ability classrooms. This is evident in my class data on assessments and presentational tasks. By a large margin, students in Spanish 1 do much better than students in either Spanish 2 or Spanish 3, and Spanish 1 students also can comprehend and produce more of the target language, and have less of a resistance to it. This could be for a number of reasons. The first and most obvious one is that as an introductory course (with the exception of native speakers, of whom I have two) the mixed abilities factor is virtually gone. Even students who academically do much better than other students are at only a slight advantage; everyone is essentially starting from zero. The opposite is true in the other levels. In Spanish 2 and 3 students' language history begins to diverge. Are they taking it in consecutive years or spread out? Do they have the same teacher? Have they used it outside of school? These uncontrollable factors make higher levels not just more difficult to learn, but more difficult to teach. As I continue writing and researching, the question of "How can I overcome these three factors and continue to move toward 95% to 100% target language?" will remain a focus in my mind.
</p>
<p>
While achieving full Target Language in my classroom is my goal, it is important to discuss the schools of thought that don't necessarily agree with teaching in only target language. Jang Ho Lee wrote a paper in 2012, "English Teaching: Practice and Critique" criticizing policies in Korea that demand that English classes be taught only in English. "Use English to teach English" is the motto in many World Language curriculums. She argues, however, that in a bilingual global society, we should teach bilingualism. She goes on to explain four assumptions that we make about how to teach a foreign language: Monolingualism, Naturalism, Native-speakerism, and Absolutism.
<sup>
<sup>
2
</sup>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
Lee defines monoligualism as implying that any language other than the target language should not be used, no matter what. She defines Naturalism as the idea that language learners will learn second and third languages much more efficiently if learned in a "natural" way similar to how toddlers' learn their first language. She defines Native-speakerism as the view that separates native speaker teachers from non-native speaker teachers and that one is more effective than another (this is most associated with English as a second language, so I will not be going into detail). Finally, Absolutism is defined as the absolute confidence in monolingualism, and it presupposes that other techniques cannot be valid.
<sup>
<sup>
3
</sup>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
Native-speakerism and monolingualism can be mostly applied to learning English, and Lee's paper speaks directly to that subject. Naturalism and Absolutism, however, can be applied to learning foreign languages in middle school and high school. Naturalism suggests that teaching in only the target language will allow the student to learn a language in a similar way to how a first language is learned, through constant immersion. Lee questions this assumption based on the two schools of thought attached to being bilingual. Henry Widdowson has coined terms for the two accepted theories of bilingual people; "compound bilingualism" and "coordinate bilingualism."
<sup>
<sup>
4
</sup>
</sup>
Compound bilingualism claims that when someone learns a second language, the two languages become inseparable and intertwined in the learner's mind. For people like me, who became bilingual at a very early age (three years old) this does not seem to be the case. I can very easily turn one language off or on. I can also have both on, so to speak, and switch between them very quickly. When I am actively teaching in the classroom, both languages are on; however, when I am visiting family who speak only Spanish, my English is off. Whether that is voluntary or involuntary seems a mystery to most researchers.
</p>
<p>
For Widdowson, according to Lee, coordinate bilingualism is "coordinate bilingualisation" in which L1 and TL linguistic systems are held to be neither interfering with each other nor fusing into one single system."
<sup>
<sup>
5
</sup>
</sup>
It seems as though the process of teaching in only the target language would be coordinate bilingualisation because one language is not dependent on the other. However, it also seems as though bilingual learners who learn a second language later in life cannot separate one language from another. This doesn't mean that they constantly translate in their head, but it does mean that they use each language to help expand the other one. This seems to be how bilingual learners from later in life become fluent.
<sup>
<sup>
6
</sup>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
Lee makes a case for bilingual teaching rather than teaching in only target language. I think that Lee is going in the right direction. However, when thinking about high school students from New Haven, it is difficult to make the assumption that learners will use both languages to help each language; rather they will use English as a crutch and never accept the difficulty of learning any new language. For example, I fell into the trap this year of using too much English, especially in my Spanish 2 classes. When I tried to go back to more Spanish the students rebelled and would say, "JUST TELL US WHAT IT MEANS, JUST TRANSLATE!" I had created a crutch for them and ended up paralyzing them for good. Yet I think that if English is used on a teacher's terms rather than a student's terms, then English can be used effectively to teach.

<h2>
The Brain and How it Learns Language
</h2>
<p>
When I began thinking about this unit, I tried thinking of how I could get students to learn more efficiently. Then it came to me: I never learned about how the brain actually works in terms of learning language. Understanding this process could lead to significant breakthrough in pedagogy for World Language teachers. The following is a summary of how the brain processes language.
</p>
<p>
In 1861 France, Paul Broca began a study on a man named "Tan" because that was the only sound he could make, although he could understand language and had no motor disabilities. Upon Tan's death, Broca examined his brain and noticed a lesion on a particular part of his brain. To test his hypothesis, Broca examined eight other patients who had similar language disabilities. Each of them had similar lesions in the same part of the brain. He came to the conclusion that "we speak with the left hemisphere."
<sup>
<sup>
7
</sup>
</sup>
Another section that was associated with language was discovered ten years later by Carl Wernicke. He figured out that people who had injuries in this part of the brain could speak, but could not create coherent sentences; they could not comprehend the language. Focusind on these two parts of the brain, the first language theory came to be, created by American neurologist Norman Geschwind.
<sup>
<sup>
8
</sup>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
In essence, according to Geschwind, each part of our brain that is associated with language is connected to the other. It is the connections between the Broca and Wernicke areas that allow us to understand language. Without those areas working properly, any sound coming in contact with our ears and brain are just that, sound, regardless if it is meant to be meaningful language at all. When we are learning a second language, our brains are not necessarily using Wernicke area just yet; it takes time and practice for that part of the brain to activate. Broca's area is the section of the brain that allows the production of language, mainly, speaking and writing.
<sup>
<sup>
9
</sup>
</sup>
These two areas of the brain need to work together for people to use language effectively. It seems that the questions are: Do people who are bilingual have more connections between these two areas of the brain, are the areas larger, or is the second language held in some other part of the brain?
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="../../../images/2014/1/14.01.05.01.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Well, in the year 2000 at Cornell University a study whose overall goal was to determine the use of fMRI's was conducted. One of the parts of the study was testing several bilingual people, half of whom learned both languages in their infancy while the other half learned their second language as adults.
<sup>
<sup>
10
</sup>
</sup>
Their finding was very interesting. They found that bilingual people's Wernicke area, which is responsible for understanding language, was similar to that of monolingual people: that part of the brain handles all understanding of language, regardless of the language. Almost as if to that part of the brain, there is only one language, the language of comprehension.
</p>
<p>
Broca's area, which is responsible for the production of language is different. For all bilingual people tested, there were two distinct sections in the brain responsible for producing each language, essentially, there were two separate Broca's areas. For those that learned early in childhood, these sections were large and overlapping, while those who learned later in life had smaller sections that did not overlap as much. This is so fascinating because it explains a lot. I learned both English and Spanish at the same time. I can think in either language, and I can go back and forth several times in the same sentence; maybe that's because the same part of my brain is active whether I am speaking English or Spanish. On the other hand, this theory can also explain why people who learn a second language later in life cannot do those things. It also explains the final phenomenon that the comprehension of language and the production of language, while inevitably connected, are distinct. There are so many Latino students around the country who grow up hearing Spanish at home but using English at school. The outcome of that situation are students who understand Spanish fluently, but absolutely cannot speak it or write it. It seems very counter intuitive but these scientific advancements are providing meaningful insights into language learning.

<h2>
Using Pictures to Teach a Second Language
</h2>
<p>
All teachers use images to teach. It is an inherent part of our craft. Science teachers use diagrams of different topics from body parts to diagrams of ecosystems. History teachers and English teachers use art to portray a variety of things. Math teachers use all sorts of graphs to help students conceptualize abstractions. World Language teachers also use pictures, in the same way that pre-school and kindergarten teachers use pictures: to teach vocabulary.
</p>
<p>
Vocabulary is one of the most essential and necessary things to learn when trying to master a new language. Without it, nothing would have meaning. The various textbooks that many educators use, like
<i>
Realidades
</i>
or
<i>
Expresate
</i>
, know this all too well. For each new chapter there is a picture with various things going on in them and Spanish vocabulary scattered throughout. This is a very effective way to get students to learn vocabulary while avoiding translation. All the vocabulary that is presented, however, falls into three categories: things, actions, and adjectives. While I won't claim that using pictures to teach these different vocabulary categories is easy, I will say that it is pretty straightforward.  A unit like this one would not have to be written about it.
</p>
<p>
What is very interesting about all of the textbooks that we use, is that as soon as they transition from rote vocabulary to grammar so that students can begin to create sentences, the pictures disappear. The following is an example of what I mean.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="../../../images/2014/1/14.01.05.02.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
For me this example is telling. It shows that mainstream authors of textbooks for teaching a World Language have not figured out a way to effectively teach grammar in the same fashion as they teach vocabulary. There must be a way.
</p>
<p>
There are two authors who have created and implemented theories that seem to work, the first of whom is Andrew Wright. In his book
<i>
Pictures for Language Learning,
</i>
he gives over 200 different examples of how to use pictures to teach different ideas in a language. He presents five different concepts or five ways of looking at language. Those five ways are: Structures, Vocabulary, Functions, Situations, and Skills.
</p>
<p>
Structures are simple statements that don't have any underlying meaning, there is no need for analysis. "The boy is walking." or "Is it raining?" are two examples of this. Vocabulary are lists of words that can be out into categories. White, black, yellow, orange are all colors. Functions look more at the meaning behind a statement. For example, when students are learning how to say "Hello, how are you? My name is Jean." They are really learning how to introduce themselves to someone else. Situations seem to be the most complex of the five: putting together structures, vocabulary, and functions that a student is familiar with to be able to describe a situation or maintain a meaningful conversation. The four skills in language are reading, writing, listening, and speaking. As teachers we should make sure that students are exposed to the preceding four ways of looking at language with all four skills. Wright shares many examples on how to do that. In the strategies section of this unit, I go over several examples in detail
<sup>

<p>
M. Stanley Whitley and Patricia V. Lunn recently republished a book in digital form entitled
<i>
Teaching Spanish Grammar with Pictures: How to Use William Bull's Visual Grammar of Spanish
</i>
. In it they discuss William Bull's language theories as well as the 400 pictures he created to help teach Spanish grammar in particular.
</p>
<p>
There are three key ideas that Bull wrote about in terms of teaching and learning language. First, linguists have not paid attention to the role of meaning in their concentration on form. Second, learning another language is really another way to structure the world, not just language. Finally, something's meaning and function are defined by the contrasts to other things in the system. The first key idea on linguistics really speaks to two points: first, tenses in language are to situate readers or listeners in particular situations and cannot really have "rules," and second, "English translation is irrelevant to the structure of the Spanish language."
<sup>
<sup>
12
</sup>
</sup>
</p>
<p>
Bull's second main idea is about structuring the world. A great example is the verb
<i>
to be
</i>
. In English we use to be in many different ways. A system is in place where we understand why we are using to be in different contexts. The way Spanish's system is organized is different.
<i>
ser, estar
</i>
, and
<i>
haber
</i>
can be translated to "to be" in English, however Spanish speakers use each of the three verbs in different ways. This is a very good example to support not translating in the classroom. When I teach
<i>
ser vs estar
</i>
in Spanish 2, the students inevitably become confused and can't wrap their heads around the concept because they are stuck trying to translate the two different verbs to the same English verb.
</p>
<p>
Bull's third main idea rests on the principal that everything needs to be contrasted to be understood. In his 400 posters, which I am using for this unit, all of the pictures come in pairs or groups. In Spanish there are so many examples that could be used with these photos. For example, when we say "to leave the book" and "to leave the library," most English speakers understand what those sentences mean and that
<i>
to leave
</i>
has a slightly different definition in each. In Spanish, this slight difference in definition means that there are two different verbs.
<i>
Dejar
</i>
means to leave something behind, while
<i>
salir
</i>
means to leave or exit a space. Using translation and English to explain these small differences always confuse students. Now, however, I can provide suggestions as to how to avoid these confusions by using images.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Classroom Activities
</h2>
<p>
My research and this unit are about how to teach Spanish. The strategies that I offer are not specific to the topic that I use in each example. As a language teacher, feel free to adjust, add, or exclude any of what you find here to your classrooms.
</p>
<h3>
The Brain
</h3>
<p>
The first part and probably the most important part of teaching this unit is teaching about how the brain learns language and why learning language through pictures is more effective than translation. Finding a unique and engaging way to teach this in Spanish and making sure that the students are comprehending can be a challenge. As I said earlier, I believe that if the students understand what is happening within their brains as they are learning the language, they are more likely to become invested in it. Using William Bull's method of using contrasting images you can get the students to comprehend how Broca and Wernicke's sections of the brain function. The following would be a series of images, that you can create yourself or find some cartoons for online. The text in bracket is the image and the text in quotes is the language that accompanies it.
</p>
<p>
[Human with dialogue bubble, recognizable Spanish vocabulary]
</p>
<p>
"La persona habla."
</p>
<p>
[Zombie with dialogue bubble, not recognizable gibberish]
</p>
<p>
"El zombie no habla."
</p>
<p>
[Human reading a book]
</p>
<p>
"La persona lee."
</p>
<p>
[Zombie trying to read a book, looks confused]
</p>
<p>
"El zombie no lee."
</p>
<p>
What you want to do is show that a person can perform the four skills of language use reading, writing, speaking and listening-- and a zombie cannot. After you show all the images, your final image should be the contrasting a human brain with that of a zombie brain. You want your human brain to have Broca's area and Wernicke's area lit up. By pointing and using simple words like
<i>
escuchar
</i>
,
<i>
hablar
</i>
, and
<i>
leer
</i>
, students should be able to deduce what skills are controlled by each section of the brain. After the activity give them a sheet with comprehension questions on them that include English: What skills of language is Broca's area responsible for? What about Wernicke's? It is also important to include a question that allows students to make a connection to their own lives, if they know someone who can read and listen but not speak. The fun cartoons, simple language, and connections to their own experience will give students the best chance to retain the material you want them to leave with.
</p>
<p>
<i>

</p>
<p>
<i>
Using Flaps to Teach Changing Concepts
</i>
</p>
<p>
One of Andrew Wright's most effective techniques is the use of flaps. You can use this with any set of vocabulary that has changing meanings.
<sup>
13
</sup>
<i>
To like
</i>
something and
<i>
to not like
</i>
something is an easy example. What you do is take a large piece of paper or construction paper and fold the bottom so that the edge reaches half way up the page. It doesn't matter which direction you fold first because you are going to switch back and forth. Assuming the flap is on the back you can draw a boy or girl's happy face. Under his or her face you can draw two or three things that he or she likes. Once you finish that you fold the paper the other way so that it covers the smile on the face. On the folded piece of paper you draw the frown and two or three things he or she does not like. The flap changes the information.
</p>
<p>
When presenting this to the students you do not need to speak any English, the picture gives the meaning of the things drawn giving happiness or sadness and the idea is conveyed. As a follow up you can give the students this assignment: have them draw their own likes and dislikes and practice speaking with each other using the pictures that they have drawn.
</p>
<p>
<i>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Ser vs Estar
</i>
</p>
<p>
This distinction is one of the most dreaded concepts for teachers to teach in Spanish because most students cannot grasp which verb to use in which situation. The following would be most appropriate for a Spanish 2 class that already has a significant amount of vocabulary knowledge as well as exposure to both SER and ESTAR. The most basic way that teachers will try to explain is that SER means to be when in a permanent state, as in the statement "I am tall" would be "yo soy alto", and ESTAR means to be in a not permanent state as in the statement "I am sad" would be "yo estoy triste." However this rule has many exceptions, so many that it doesn't really work as a rule. There are many different versions of the set of rules given, but like Bull, I will avoid using rules and use images that depict what those rules mean. As I have before, I will use brackets to describe the image and quotes for the Spanish text that should go with it.
</p>
<p>
The following is a set of images from Bull's poster collection in which SER and ESTAR are contrasted through a series of images that tells a story about an overweight man who goes to the hospital and has surgery (the surgery is implied) and becomes thin. His friend sees him and is so surprised at his new figure. Later, however, the newly skinny man goes to a café and binge eats and get fat again. SER and ESTAR are used differently in each image.
</p>
<p>
[Fat man]
</p>
<p>
"Pedro es gordo."
</p>
<p>
[Fat man meets friend whose thought bubble says…]
</p>
<p>

This example shows that characteristics, although typically used with
<i>
ser
</i>
, can be used with
<i>
estar
</i>
in certain situations. While showing each image, you should have the students read each one and take time to look at each one. At the end of this activity it should be acceptable to have a conversation in English about the activity as a whole, especially the first few times you do it. A follow up activity would be to use similar pictures and have the students write the caption for each one.

World-Readiness Standards for Learning World Languages
</b>
</p>
<p>
- Interpersonal Communication: Learners interact and negotiate meaning in spoken, signed, or written conversations to share information, reactions, feelings, and opinions.
</p>
<p>
- Interpretive Communication: Learners understand, interpret, and analyze what is heard, read, or viewed on a variety of topics.
</p>
<p>
- Presentational Communication: Learners present information, concepts, and ideas to inform, explain, persuade, and narrate on a variety of topics using appropriate media and adapting to various audiences of listeners, readers, or viewers.
</p>
<p>
- Making Connections: Learners build, reinforce, and expand their knowledge of other disciplines while using the language to develop critical thinking and to solve problems creatively
</p>
<p>
- Acquiring Information and Diverse Perspectives: Learners access and evaluate information and diverse perspectives that are available through the language and its cultures
</p>
<p>
In terms of the World Language Standards, the communication and connections strands are the ones most associated with this unit. Using comparative images to teach grammar in only the target language allows for students to practice their interpretative communication and make connections between different types of verbs. The section on the brain addresses the connection standard again by teaching something from another discipline, and allows students to think meta-cognitively about what they are learning.
