Introduction
</h2>
<p>
Now, in my fourth year of teaching as a New Haven Public School elementary teacher at Davis Street Arts and Academics Magnet School, I have come to understand and appreciate the opportunities, which arise throughout our tumultuous school year wherein we, as lovers of learning, can integrate deeper, more meaningful explorations into the curriculum. This being my first year teaching fourth grade, I am exploring for the first time heightened common core state standards proposed for this grade level as well as new and exciting curriculum material designed to meet those standards.  While our district has given the subject areas of literacy and mathematics an abundance of mandatory lessons, helpful materials and resources, the subject areas of Science and Social Studies seem to have been robbed not only of the afore mentioned resource materials but so too of the time allotted in each day with which to survey these subjects in a meaningful, engaging way. Similarly, our writing curriculum, although well laid out in terms of which genres of writing we must teach during each marking period, lacks depth. Many of the mini-lessons provided in our curriculum binder are related to the mechanics of writing and the organization of writing journals and fall short in offering meaningful ways to incorporate lesson material into a writing project or performance task. It is my goal therefore to create a curriculum unit, which incorporates a more in depth exploration of science and social studies by way of meaningful performance tasks and written activities.
</p>
<p>
Today in my fourth grade classroom we are reading a non-fiction core text from our "Plugged Into Reading" program, entitled Rescues by Sandra Markle. This engaging text deals with the various natural disasters that have occurred throughout the world in recent years and how professional rescue teams as well as volunteers have brought survivors to safety. In tandem with this core-text, my students are researching various natural disasters (forest fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, etc.) from the perspective of science. Through my curriculum unit, my goal is to find ways to expand these studies into the more intrinsically interesting subject of how human communities (schools, neighborhoods, towns, nations) are affected by and respond to such challenges in accordance with their own moral value systems and resources. Since the concept of community is neither straight-forward nor concrete in terms of a definition, I have found that approaching this subject requires a great deal of care and sensitivity. Therefore, the conceptual framework I propose is meant to gradually release the responsibility of understanding 'community' to my students by way of guiding them from an analysis of 'outside' communities to a reflection of their own lives and the lives of those in their immediate communities.
</p>
<p>
In addition to and, possibly, more importantly than the academic objectives of my unit, my goal is to raise my students' awareness of their integral role within their classroom and school community as well as their neighborhood community. In order to impact their notions of responsibility towards their communities, my curriculum unit takes them on an exploration of community through an in depth study of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Through non-fiction texts, articles, case studies, film and other media, we will observe how communities, both far and near, reacted to the devastation and destruction wrought by not only the hurricane itself but, almost more importantly, by the failed rescue attempts of institutions that only served to worsen the blow.  Upon identifying those characteristics, which both failed and came to the rescue of this traumatized community, I will guide my students to be self-reflective and determine what kinds of moral value systems they intend to act upon as they live and develop within their various communities.
</p>
<p>
This unit links together history, geography, writing and literacy through interdisciplinary explorations into how victims whose lives are directly and inadvertently endangered as well as those who voluntarily risk their lives to be a part of rescue efforts, react in groups to meet the imminent danger posed by these natural disasters. In so doing, the essential question I ask my students to reflect on in the culminating section of this unit is: How might I function as an individual within my community? In this way, my students are being invited to take what they have gleaned from their research to a more personal level that can stimulate their self-expression. So too does it cultivate a sense of personal agency in the face of forces beyond one's own control within my students.
</p>
<p>
Throughout this unit my students work in both small- and large-group settings on the activities included in this unit. The unit lessons are implemented 4-5 times a week, for a period of 40-60 minutes over a 4-month period. I have divided my curriculum-unit into four sections in which I employ the use of fiction and non-fiction texts as well as film and Internet resources, in an effort to engage them in active reading and enhance their writing ability. The sections are:

<h2>
Section 1: Rescues!
</h2>
<p>
The first phase of my curriculum unit takes place in the second marking period wherein students are exposed to informational text during Reading Workshop and are expected to write an expository piece during Writing Workshop. This phase is designed to give students an introduction to the various rescue efforts, which have gone on throughout the world in the recent past. Through the use of our core-text, Rescues!, I provide my students with relevant information regarding the various facets of survival which entail preparedness before, during and after a particular event. I must ensure that my students are grasping this information by way of modeling and providing practice using the eight power strategies of reading informational text: Monitoring Understanding, Identifying Text Structures, Identifying Text Features, Previewing Text, Asking Questions, Notetaking and Specialized Vocabulary. You will find that we often make use of the numerous graphic organizers provided by the Plugged-Into Reading program which highlight word studies of specialized vocabulary, the use of text-features when reading non-fiction texts, initiate small research projects and measure students' comprehension of the material covered throughout the text.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 1: Utilizing Text Features to Preview the Text
</p>
<p>
Through the use of the 'Plugged Into Reading' graphic organizer " Previewing with Book Parts" (pgs. 77-78), students explore Sandra Markel's Rescues! and are prompted to make inferences and predictions using the text clues found in photographs, headings, glossary and other critical text features. Students are then paired up to discuss their findings and share connections they might have to the information they come across.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 2: Activating Background Knowledge by Asking Questions
</p>
<p>
Through the use of a KWL chart, students jot down any information they feel they already know about Rescue efforts under the K column. Students are then asked to fill in the W column of their chart with Questions they still have regarding the topic, which arise as a result of previewing the text. Students come together whole class and one large KWL chart is generated in order to share common understandings and questions. As students read the text in the coming days, they are encouraged to fill out the L section of the chart with 'What I have Learned'.
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="../../../images/2014/2/14.02.03.01.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
Lesson 3: Identifying Text Structures: Sequence and Chronology
</p>
<p>
Students read their first rescue account, "Hasty to the Rescue" and work with the text structure of Sequence and Chronology to create a diagram, which demonstrates the main events in the story, which began with the avalanche disaster and culminated in the rescue of the victim in a plot diagram. Students are guided to include the conflict, rising action, climax, falling action and conclusion.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 4: Identifying Text Structures: Sequence and Chronology
</p>
<p>
Students read 'Frozen Child" and continue to work with the text structure of Sequence Chronology to describe and depict what occurs when Hypothermia takes over the body using the Plugged Into Reading graphic organizer (pg100).
</p>
<p>
Lesson 5: Identifying Text Structures: Sequence and Chronology
</p>
<p>
Students read "Nine Miners Trapped" and create a timeline with illustrations and captions, which depict the sequence of events leading up to the disaster and culminating in the rescue.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 6: Identifying Text Structures: Compare and Contrast
</p>
<p>
Students read "Baby in a Burning House" and "Saving Elvis" and compare and contrast the circumstances in each situation to determine what factors were similar and different in each disaster using the Plugged Into Reading graphic organizer (pg 132). Students draw conclusions regarding what is most important to remember in such an emergency situation and how best to be prepared for such an unfortunate event.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 7: Determining Critical Information
</p>
<p>
Students read "Tsunami Strikes" and jot down the measures that need to be taken before, during and after such an event to increase the likelihood of survival.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 8: Determining Critical Information
</p>
<p>
Students read "Surviving Katrina" and compare the circumstances of Hurricane Katrina to those of the Tsunami in Thailand using the Plugged Into Reading graphic organizer (pg 161). Here students are guided to summarize the critical information using the specialized vocabulary words floundering, tsunami, survivors and debris when describing "Tsunami Strikes" and evacuated, agencies, generator and chaos when describing the events of "Surviving Katrina".
</p>
<p>
Lesson 9: Elements of a Survival Guide
</p>
<p>
Students read 'A Kid's Wilderness Survival Primer' by Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht from the Plugged Into Reading resource materials (pgs. 185-189) and take note of the structure and organization of the guide by way of its paragraphs, headings and sub headings. This serves as a model of expository writing.
</p>
<p>
As a final project for this phase, students write their own survival guides on "How to Survive Fourth Grade since, in many ways, the children are starting to become 'experts' on ways they have found to meet with success, both academically and behaviorally. In order that the brochure follow expository writing guidelines and also lend itself to a survival guide of sorts, the students must come up with a thesis statement to the effect of: "In order to be successful in fourth grade you must be prepared before, during and after." Students then list which strategies, routines and/or ideas of preparedness they have for each phase of fourth grade thus far in the year and will support each with specific examples.  As a reflection of what they have gleaned from the text features and structures within the Rescues! book, students are required to include 4 or more text features within their brochure as a way to make it more visually appealing and engaging for their audience. Students eventually present these brochures to the incoming third graders at the end of the year as a way to bring purpose and meaning to their projects.  To follow is the rubric used to assess their brochures:

Section 2: Researching Natural Disasters
</h2>
<p>
The second phase of my curriculum unit takes place in the third marking period wherein informational text is still our primary literary focus and yet, in writing, students are required to learn the necessary steps to researching and paraphrasing information they have gathered on a particular topic. From our reading of Rescues!, students choose a natural disaster, which piques their interest most and then engage in further research of this topic. During this time, students are given presentations in our school library on how to search the Internet for credible, reliable sources and how to cite sources in a bibliography. I also give mini-lessons on how to avoid plagiarism when taking notes. This phase culminates in a poster or PowerPoint presentation given by pairs of students along with a model component in the form of a diorama. In this way students learn not only how to research but also about the important skills of working with another person cooperatively and efficiently.
</p>
<p>

Lesson 2: How to Research using Credible Sources on the Internet
</p>
<p>
Students are given a mini-lesson on the importance of searching for information on reputable websites versus the less-reliable, commercial ones. Students are then taught how to use websites like bearport.com, www.iconn.org , www.nationalgeographic.com etc, using keyword searches. It will be explained to students that information posted on commercial websites are actually paid to issue information which many times is not accurate and therefore not credible. Students are also given a Bibliography graphic organizer on which to begin citing their sources. Organizing their research sources into genre and identifying all of the components of a bibliography will be modeled. Students spend time in the computer lab practicing their searches on the afore mentioned websites and will be given scaffolded instruction and assistance in citing their sources appropriately.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 3: Paraphrasing Vs. Plagiarizing
</p>
<p>
Students learn the difference between taking direct quotes from a reading passage and rewriting someone else's words into our own words. The teacher models how present factual information gathered from a source in such a way that it is not using the original author's exact phrasing. Students are also cautioned that simply changing a few words within a sentence is not the true essence of paraphrasing either. Students are shown how to take direct quotes and cite them properly. (See Lesson Plan 1)
</p>
<p>
Lesson 4: Culminating Performance Tasks
</p>
<p>
Once students have gathered their information and written rough drafts of their notes on each guided question, they can be given the option to present the material on a poster or PowerPoint. Students who already know how to use PowerPoint will, in turn, show their partners how to create PowerPoint presentations and peer learning can occur naturally. Students who create a PowerPoint need to include 10 slides with pictures and some animation while students who choose to make a poster need to include headings, diagrams, pictures and organize their information in a cohesive manner. Students also have to work together on some sort of three-dimensional representation of their natural disaster, either in the form of a diorama or demonstration model. Students are assessed on their knowledge of the topic and their creativity in demonstrating their understanding of forces that cause the disaster to occur and its effects on the communities in its path.

<h2>
Section 3: Exploring Community through the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina
</h2>
<p>
The third phase of my curriculum unit delves more deeply into the complex nature of community through a closer look at the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina by way of looking more closely into the devastation that occurred as a result of not only the hurricane itself but also due to the conflicted nature of the rescue efforts, which ensued after the storm. It should be noted here that earlier in the year, my students engaged in a unit of study on Global Warming, wherein they researched various ways in which humans are altering the global environment by emitting carbon dioxide and other green-house gasses into the atmosphere. My students also completed a science experiment wherein they measured how the percentage of CO2 in the atmosphere affected the amount of time it took that environment to cool down. In addition to winning first place in the district city science fair, this hands-on approach to learning about what Global Warming actually means led to further explorations into how climate change is leading to various forms of natural disasters like glaciers melting, flooding, mudslides, drought and forest fires, etc. Upon developing this kind of background knowledge and environmental awareness, students can approach this complex concept of Anthropocene with a greater sense of maturity as it brings to light the fact that what we may call a natural disaster is in fact often a direct result of human activity.  Therefore, following this train of thought, my students have greater insight into how the choices and actions by members of a community lead to a wide variety of short and long-term consequences, both positive and disastrous.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 1: A Humanistic Approach to Disaster
</p>
<p>
We begin our study of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina through a literary approach in our reading of A Storm Called Katrina by Myron Uhlberg and beautifully illustrated by Colin Bootman. This story draws from real-life events as it paints a portrait of a ten-year old boy and his family in the immediate aftermath of the devastating hurricane and powerfully brings to light the challenges faced by the people of New Orleans and the response of its community through small acts of heroism. After reading this story, students are asked to reflect on the following questions:
</p>
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>
1.
</td>

How did this disaster bring the community together?
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2.
</td>

</td>
<td>
What acts, both good and bad, did people engage in that they otherwise wouldn't have?
</td>

</td>
<td>
How did Louis Daniel show courage?
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
6.
</td>
<td>
What purpose did this tragedy bring to his ability to play the trumpet?
</td>
</tr>
</table>
Students work in pairs to share their reflections and explore this story from the perspective of other characters in the story, like the mother, father or dog in order to see it from various points of view and recognized the feelings and experiences that would be shared by all under such circumstances.
<p>
Lesson 2: Surviving Katrina
</p>
<p>
Students revisit the story, "Surviving Katrina" in the Rescues! core text as a way to refresh their memories of the event through the case study of Karen Nelson, a nurse in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, who was looking after a fifteen-year old boy named William who was in need of a heart transplant when the hurricane hit. Students will now be asked to reflect on the more humanistic qualities of this account wherein Karen acted like a true hero, risking her own life to ensure that William was rescued. Students are then asked to analyze Karen's choices to stick with William through it all instead of abandoning him and saving herself. Students are asked to act as one side of her conscience and persuade her in a paragraph or two to act in a certain way.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 3: Getting the Facts
</p>
<p>
Students engage in research to better understand the events, which led up to the hurricane, occurred throughout the onslaught of the disaster and took place in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina utilizing the skills they have learned from phase 2 of the curriculum unit. Students can use non-fiction texts like Hurricane Katrina, Aftermath of Disaster by Barb Palser, Hurricanes, Witness to Disaster by Judy and Dennis Fradin, Hurricane Katrina by Peter Benoit. Additionally, clips from Spike Lee's documentaries, When the Levees Broke and If God is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise as well as the National Geographic documentary, Inside Hurricane Katrina. In preparation for an upcoming written piece, students are then given guiding questions to consider as they research these various media:
</p>
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>
1)
</td>
<td>
How was the natural disaster turned into a man-made disaster?
</td>

What were some common feelings and experiences by all victims?
</td>

<tr>
<td>
10)
</td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Students are also given the option to glean understanding from novels like, I Survived Hurricane Katrina by Lauren Tarshis as well as Zane and the Hurricane by Rodman Philbrick, in order to incorporate different genres of reading into the research process. We also explore several articles from www.iconn.org like "You Can Count on Us" by Alan Van Zelfden and "After the Hurricane" by Suzanne McCabe. Having access to different articles through this website allows us to read diverse perspectives and study differing points of view regarding the disaster and its aftermath. Once again we revisit the importance of preparedness before, during and after a natural disaster and then use our understanding of rescues, survival guides and natural disasters to analyze what went wrong in New Orleans. Since students are in the fourth marking period by this time, this phase includes a persuasive writing piece wherein students take a stand and try to persuade their audience of what went wrong and what could have been done differently in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. (See Lesson Plan 2)
</p>
<p>
Lesson 4: Designing a Functional Levee
</p>
<p>
Students also engage in an engineering project wherein they work in groups of four to design a levee, which can withstand flooding. (See Lesson Plan 3.)
</p>
<p>
Lesson 5: Do humans play a role in 'Natural Disasters'?
</p>
<p>
To bring this phase to a conclusion, students reflect on what a natural disaster is versus a disaster wherein humans do play a role? And, do humans also play a role in 'natural disasters' indirectly? To support students in their reflection, as a whole class, we can then brainstorm and categorize those characteristics, which brought about the necessary change during the aftermath of Katrina and those characteristics, which further entrenched the community in tragedy and destruction. Such a discussion might lead to the following chart:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="../../../images/2014/2/14.02.03.03.jpg"/>
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Section 4: What is my Role in my Community?
</h2>
<p>
The fourth phase of the curriculum unit requires my students to think about the essential question: How might I function as an individual within my community? My children will be asked to use any and all of the written pieces they have created thus far to come up with one service initiative, which will inform the class of how they intend to function as a member of the community.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 1: Reading Accounts of Kids who have Served their Communities
</p>
<p>
Students engage in reading texts like Community Helpers from A to Z by Bobbie Kalman and Niki Walker and read articles like "The Service Effect: How Helping The Community Develops Strong Leadership" by Darian Smith and "Community = Happy" by Ashleigh Haynes, "The Girl Who Planted Hope: How Do I Make A Difference In My Community?" by Layla Akay and "YOU Can Change THE WORLD" by Phoebe Ducote, which offer real life examples of how children have made a difference within their communities in a variety of ways.
</p>
<p>
Lesson 2: Community Service
</p>
<p>
Students reflect on the articles they have read and come up with 5 possible service activities they could engage in to support their school or neighborhood communities. These activities can be focused on initiatives as simple and integral as improving communication and listening skills amongst each other and as involved as taking part in a community service project like a community garden, picking up litter in the neighborhood or raising money for a community cause. They are then placed strategically into groups of 3-4 and share their ideas. As a group they must narrow their scope down to one plan of action by way of assessing the project's necessity, practicality and anticipated impact on the community. Students will research and plan out how they will exact their plan of action and present their idea as a group to the class. Upon teacher approval, students engage in the activity for 1-2 weeks during which time they will keep a journal of their experiences and interactions with members of their community. At the end of this period of time, students present a poster advertisement persuading others to get involved in their cause.

<h2>
Lesson Plan 1
</h2>
<p>
Rationale: When researching, students must understand the difference between paraphrasing versus plagiarizing in order that they develop the former and avoid the latter.
</p>
<p>
Learning Goal: Today we are learning how to paraphrase information we read in our research so that we can put our understanding of the author's ideas into our own words.
</p>
<p>
Materials: a brief article or paragraph for each student to practice paraphrasing i.e.  "Cool Job" by Lorrie Castaneda from the Plugged Into Reading Resource materials for Rescues!
</p>
<p>
Procedure:
</p>
<p>
1) Begin by asking students if they know what plagiarism means. Depending on the responses, explain the term making sure to highlight how easy it is to make the mistake of plagiarizing when doing research due to the fact that collecting facts from non-fiction texts can easily lead to using the authors exact words when transferring that information into their own research documents.
</p>
<p>
2) Discuss the meaning of paraphrasing and model an example of putting your understanding of what an author writes into your own words using an article like "Cool Jobs" by Lorrie Castaneda. The first paragraph reads:
</p>
<p>
"At some point in his or her life, nearly every kid wants to be a firefighter. In 1998, the "Didja Ever Want to Be a FIREMAN?" survey on the World Wide Web tried to establish why. After four years of collecting responses, the survey pinpointed four reasons people wanted to become firefighters: the excitement, the heroics, the camaraderie, and a family history of firefighters."
</p>
<p>
3) On the board, model for the students one possible way to paraphrase this information:
</p>
<p>
<font color="#ffffff" style="visibility:hidden;">
____
</font>
Since being a firefighter is often what many kids dream of becoming, researchers decided to put out a survey on the internet called "Didja Ever Want to Be a FIREMAN?" After many years of research they determined four main reasons: 1) the job is exciting, 2) the job allows you to act like a hero, 3) the job helps you make good friends and 4) if you have firefighters in the family, you are more likely to become one youself!
</p>
<p>
4) Explain to students that in order to paraphrase successfully they must understand the vocabulary the author uses. For example, without really knowing what camaraderie is, you cannot accurately paraphrase that critical information. Point out that a tendency of students is to just copy the words they don't understand and then when they are asked what it means, they demonstrate a lack of understanding. Encourage the students to imagine explaining their understanding to a friend and to write down what that natural explanation would sounds like.
</p>
<p>
5) Next, take another paragraph from the same article and practice paraphrasing it as a whole class where the teacher writes down the ideas of the students and guides them accordingly. Actually practice having a child look of a new vocabulary word the students may not be familiar with so they can understand the process and it's importance.
</p>
<p>
6) Have the students work in small groups to paraphrase a third paragraph and then share out their various paraphrases to demonstrate that there are often multiple ways to express the same information. This is also an opportunity to guide those students who tend to use to much of the original text such that their own sentences sound choppy and awkward.
</p>
<p>
7) Finally, have students practice paraphrasing a fourth paragraph independently and then share with a partner what they have written.
</p>
<p>
8) Walk around and observe, offering suggestions as you listen.
</p>
<p>
9) Assign another paragraph or article for homework for the students to paraphrase to give them further independent practice and feedback.
</p>
<p>
Evaluation/Assessment: We'll know we've got it when we can explain the ideas and information of an author in our own words, without plagiarizing.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Lesson Plan 2
</h2>
<p>
Rationale: Students must understand that in order to be effective in persuading an audience in written form, each argument must be well supported with evidence and examples. So too must the students anticipate counter arguments to their claim and try to address those challenges.
</p>
<p>
Learning Goal: Today we are learning how to write well-supported claims so that we can persuade our audience of our argument in what could have been done differently in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
</p>
<p>
Materials per group: H-chart
</p>
<p>
Procedure:
</p>
<p>
1) Students will take a stand on what they feel could have been done differently in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in terms of being more prepared before the storm or being more responsive after the storm hit.
</p>
<p>
2) After considering their audience (their classmates and parents), students will fill out an H-chart where on they will list both sides of the argument. This might be used to model for the students what ideas they might consider:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="../../../images/2014/2/14.02.03.04.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
3) Students will then develop their 'For' arguments further with more detail from their research and site specific examples and case studies from their readings to support their claims.
</p>
<p>
4) Students will then be guided to turn their notes from these graphic organizers and formulate paragraphs. Their introductory paragraph will need to have a hook, a thesis statement wherein they present their argument and its rationale. The following three paragraphs will lay out each of their arguments along with evidence and case study examples. Students will also be encouraged to counter the arguments against their claim. They will conclude their persuasive piece with a conclusion, which both summarizes their argument and drives home their point with a powerful statement.
</p>
<p>
5) As a way to revise and edit, students will confer with each other using a T.A.G. form wherein they Tell something they noticed or liked about their partners writing, Ask a question regarding something they may not have understood in their partners writing and then Give a suggestion to make the piece more persuasive.
</p>
<p>
6) As students confer with each other, the teacher can confer one-on-one with each student to provide feedback and guidance to children who may need more support in crafting their arguments.
</p>
<p>
7) Students will then bring their pieces to publication by typing them out and presenting them at a publishing party wherein parents and administrators are invited to attend and be their audience.
</p>
<p>
Evaluation/Assessment: We will know we've got it when we have understood all of the necessary elements that go into writing a persuasive essay.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Lesson Plan 3
</h2>
<p>
Rationale: Students are often able to identify a problem and very readily place blame for that problem however, when they are held responsible to think of a solution to that problem, they fall short of understanding the energy and care that need to go into making change happen.
</p>
<p>
Learning Goal: Today we are learning how to design a model levee so that we can attempt to create sturdy barriers to prevent water from flooding in the event of a hurricane.
</p>
<p>
Materials per group: one rectangular plastic container or tub, $10 worth of fun money, levee building materials (sand or gravel, duct tape, cotton balls, plastic sandwich bag or plastic wrap, a sponge, plastic straws, cardboard.), paper cups.
</p>
<p>
Procedure:
</p>
<p>
1) Divide the class into groups of 3-4.
</p>
<p>
2) Explain that the problem they are to solve is to build a levee system that will maintain the boundary between the lake/river and the city represented as the two sides of the rectangular plastic container.
</p>
<p>
3) Explain that their model level must be 5 inches high and wide enough to prevent the water on one side of the container from flooding into the other side of the container.
</p>
<p>
4) Provide each group with their own rectangular container and $10 of fun money, which they are to use to purchase materials from the following list:
</p>
<p>
<img alt="" src="../../../images/2014/2/14.02.03.05.jpg"/>
</p>
<p>
5) Allow students time to do some research on how real levees are constructed.
</p>
<p>
6) Have the students take two of the materials and test how well they slow down water by putting a small hole in a paper cup and putting the material at the bottom of the cup. Measure a specific amount of water and pour it into the cup with the hole to observe how well the material absorbs the water. Have students write down their observations
</p>
<p>
7) Instruct the groups to brainstorm their ideas by drawing or writing every idea that comes to mind. Remind them that no idea is too silly as creativity is necessary!
</p>
<p>
8) Have students select the most promising concept. On a fresh sheet of paper have the students draw and explain their idea.
</p>
<p>
9) Allow students to determine their budget and 'buy' their materials.
</p>
<p>
10) Have students construct the levee and assist them in testing it by pouring water into one side of the container.
</p>
<p>
11) After students have tested their models, have them reflect on what worked well and what did not work well.
</p>
<p>
12) If time allows, let them improve their model and repeat steps 6-11.
</p>
<p>
Evaluation/Assessment: We will know we've got it when we have understood all of the necessary steps that go into designing, testing and reconfiguring a possible levee that will keep water out of a designated area.

If God is Willing and Da Creek Don't Rise. Dir. Spike Lee. HBO Home Entertainment, 2010. DVD. This documentary is directed by Spike Lee and is a follow up to his earlier documentary, When the Levees Broke.

When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts. Dir. Spike Lee. HBO Video, 2006. DVD. With painstaking detail, Director Spike Lee, covers the disastrous series of events that devastated the city of New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Through vivid images, eye-witness accounts, interviews and jazz instrumental music he paints a picture of the gross incompetence of those in power of the state and federal level who mistreated the poor and underprivileged community members by blatantly ignoring their needs—acts of indifference, which Spike Lee informs the viewer, still go on to this very day.
