Introduction
</h2>
<p>
"We the people," the first three words of our constitution, carry within them the hopes of an immigrant community. The United States has always been that patchwork of migrants-an imperfect community bound together in courage and hope. We are a nation of immigrants whose ancestors', whether by force or free will, came here and survived through sheer tenacity.
</p>
<p>
Today, we are slowly becoming a nation where the dominant white population is the minority. One in which no one culture is dominant.
</p>
<p>
Introducing students to immigrant communities thriving within our own city will provide an authentic experience that will not only meet Language Arts and social studies standards but will help students begin to grapple with one of the most serious ethical quandaries of our time. It will also help students understand their own history and examine the communities to which they are members. In my classroom, I have students from: Ecuador, El Salvador, India, Iraq, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and Syria. I have had students who, until learning about immigration trends today, did not know that their parents were immigrants. I have had students who after interviewing a grandparent, see a courageous side of their family and learn to view them in a new light. I have had students whose ancestors were forced to immigrate in chains. Finally, I have had students whose indigenous ancestors greeted the European immigrants who "founded" our country. Everyone's experience should be acknowledged and heard. There is so much we can learn from each other.
</p>
<p>
Community shapes us all in ways we may not even understand. We are all members of communities defined simply by who our parents were or what neighborhood we live in. This is profoundly true for many of our students. Their communities' norms and values shape them before they reach kindergarten. Our classrooms are a microcosm of all the communities in our city. Our students' communities are defined by many attributes, both positive and negative, and by examining them within the classroom, we will create a stronger educational community.
</p>
<p>
This unit will consist of three sections and is aligned with the third quarter of the sixth grade literacy curriculum for the district of New Haven, CT, and the Common Core. It is designed to meet a variety of literacy standards and is appropriate for grades five through eight.
</p>
<p>
The first section, Immigration Trends, will give you, the teacher, background knowledge and statistics- some surprising, some interesting, and some disheartening- about immigration. Included is a short immigration history from the most prevalent sending countries: China, India and Mexico. A basic understanding of history not always discussed will give you, the teacher, a foundation to start this unit. New Haven teachers will also find a synopsis of historical immigration trends in our city.
</p>
<p>
The second section, Immigration and English Language Learners in the Classroom, covers the opportunities and challenges immigration presents in our classrooms. Achieving a clearer understanding of population trends will make you a more culturally responsive and effective educator. You will be better able to address the needs of a diverse classroom and create a safe and intriguing learning environment. One that is inclusive and sensitive to the needs of first generation, ELL students, second and third generation immigrants, and "native" students.
</p>
<p>
As teachers, we have very little control over what type of program ELL students are placed in and how they will be tested. But there are proven strategies that can reduce stress and increase comprehension for these (sometimes fragile) students. Exploring this topic with your class, within the confines of the Common Core, will provide an invigorating subject that has the power to engage newcomers to our city, and enlighten those whose ancestors have lived here for many generations. At the same time, it will provide a model for the rest of your school to emulate.
</p>
<p>
The final section is Lesson Plans that Build Community and is broken up into three parts.
</p>
<p>
In the first part, Reading Research Data, students will, in order to answer precise questions, read a variety of informational texts, including graphs and charts, on immigration statistics from governmental websites. They will also be required to synthesize this information to answer questions about how these trends change our cultural landscape. They will then draw their own conclusions about the myriad of issues immigration can present.
</p>
<p>
In the second part, Immigrant Narratives, students will discuss selected readings, including first person narratives, from immigrants today. They will then be asked to respond to these texts in a way that synthesizes information from the different types of reading material.
</p>
<p>
In the third part, Writing an Argument Essay, students will write a research-based argument essay on a local issue. The writing task for the third quarter states: Students will analyze a local issue and develop a thesis statement. Introduce and support the claim with clear reasons and relevant evidence. They will use various primary, credible sources and provide a conclusion. Though designed to meet the needs of New Haven's educational standards, students from all over the country could benefit from examining the opportunities and challenges immigration brings to their own communities.

<h2>
Immigration Trends
</h2>
<p>
By 1970 the United States had the lowest percentage of foreign-born people since the eighteen nineties. Forty years ago, 9.6 million immigrants comprised 5.6% of the population. The Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 paved the way towards change for the blatantly racist laws enacted after WWI. Also referred to as The Hart-Celler Act, it was finally enacted in June of 1968 and shifted immigration policy to favor reunification of families and give preference to professionals with skills needed in the US. Today, 40 million people living in this country were born in other countries and became legal citizens. They make up almost 13 % of our population.
<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>
The top three countries people emmigrate to America today are Mexico, India and China. Though other latin countries contribute a large percentage as a whole, the larger population in these countries simply provide more people.
</p>
<h3>
China
</h3>
<p>
<i>
Historical
</i>
</p>
<p>
Though largely overshadowed by European immigration, Chinese immigrants have made significant contributions our society. In 1848, China was being devastated by civil wars and famine. Rumors spread of Gum Saan (the "Gold Mountain") in America, and the first wave of immigration began. Then, in 1865, a second wave came to build the transcontinental railroad. The breakneck spread of its construction was extremely dangerous and occasionally deadly. Chinese men agreed to work for wages much lower than other laborers. Many Americans, especially those on the West Coast, grew fearful of the country becoming overpopulated, spurring a retaliatory wave of violence against Chinese immigrants that lasted until the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882. This act made immigration almost nonexistent and restricted travel for those already in the U.S. The act was repealed in 1943 to appease China, who was an American ally in WWII.
<sup>

<p>
<i>
Push Factors Today
</i>
</p>
<p>
Although America's school system ranks 17
<sup>
th
</sup>
in the world and students in Shanghai were recently ranked in first place, 80% of Chinese immigrants today state that they come to the United States to get a better education for their children. The majority of immigrants today are significantly better off than their predecessors. They are, for the most part, educated and considered elite. In 2011, 90,000 Chinese citizens were granted U.S. residency. Parents feel that the educational system in China requires extensive rote learning and test taking. There is also a huge emphasis on "patriotic education." Curriculum is written by the Communist Party and offers a sanitized- and some would say, skewed- version of history. Higher education is extremely competitive, and includes grueling entrance exams, despite not being highly regarded outside of China.
<sup>
3
</sup>
This has led to a profound brain drain.
</p>
<p>
Poverty and lack of opportunity have also motivated immigration. In the last few decades, hundreds of thousands of Chinese citizens have been voluntarily smuggled into our country by brokers known as "Snakeheads." They are drawn here because the work, though long and hard, pays four to five times what they could make in China.
</p>
<h3>
India
</h3>
<p>
<i>
Historical
</i>
</p>
<p>
Though considered part of the 19
<sup>
th
</sup>
century "Yellow Peril," and deemed undesirable for their religion and turbans, Hindus- as they were once called- were not as feared as other immigration groups. This was due, impart, to the fact that they did not hail from more populous "oriental" communities. At the end of the century Indian workers typically worked 19 hour days, earning approximately 18 cents an hour. Indian men were considered hard workers and this slave-labor wage was still more than they could expect in their native country. When restrictions on Chinese immigration were lifted in 1943, Indians citizens petitioned for similar rights. The Luce-Celler bill was signed by President Truman in January of 1946. This law granted naturalization rights to Filipinos and Asian Indians. Four years later, India became the world's largest democracy. With this new found freedom many found the courage necessary to immigrate to the United States. These individuals were not the indentured servants (often called "Punjab") from the turn of the century. They were now, by in large, educated and skilled.
</p>
<p>
In 2012, the Indian population in the United States was 1.9 million, making it the third largest immigrant group. There are approximately 330,000 Indians on our Visa wait list. They comprise a vibrant community that has much to offer.
<sup>

<i>
Push Factors Today
</i>
</p>
<p>
India has the 2
<sup>
nd
</sup>
largest population in the world. It is home to an incredibly diverse culture. Indian society today retains much of its historic caste system. Immigration to the west- and especially to Canada because of its free health care- provides more opportunities for families to raise their social status. Other factors include a struggling Indian economy, pollution, natural disasters, overpopulation, and a prevalence of illness.

<h3>
Mexico
</h3>
<p>
<i>
Historical
</i>
</p>
<p>
Mexico and the United States' relationship has, from its very beginning, been fraught with tension and often times far from neighborly. In the second half of the 19th century, thousands of field hands immigrated to the US. This territory that, until recently, had been part of Mexico, so there was a fine line between migration and immigration. This contentious relationship continued after Mexican-American War in which Mexico had conceded its claim to Texas. This on-again off- again relationship became especially erratic when WWI began. During wartime, Mexican labor was essential for the military's war effort, then peacetime saw America restricting immigration. In 1924, the first border patrol was formed and with it, the stigmatizing term "illegal alien."
</p>
<p>
During WWII large numbers of laborers were needed once again ensure a steady food supply. Workers were known as braceros, and were encouraged to legally and illegally immigrate. After the Korean War, the US began to restrict its borders once more. In the 1960s, outrage began to simmer over the inhumane treatment of these workers. Between 1965 and 1985, many Mexicans traveled back and forth between the two countries for seasonal work. This cyclical movement ensured that there were not many undocumented workers at any given time. The strengthening of the border patrols and the building of the wall did not deter crossings, but did and does deter returns.
<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>
<i>
Push Factors Today
</i>
</p>
<p>
In Mexico 47% of the population lives below the poverty level. While the unemployment rate is typically lower than those in the United States, the income gap is huge. Minimum wage in Mexico is about 65 pesos a day. This translates to 61 cents an hour by US standards. Many Mexicans are farmers in a land that is arid; water shortages throughout the country have been devastating.
</p>
<p>
Money sent back home to Mexico by immigrants is important for the country's economy. In 2011, workers sent home 22 billion dollars.
</p>
<p>
Violent crime is alto a push factor. In 2011, there were 12,358 murders linked to drug trafficking.

<h2>
Teaching Immigrants
</h2>
<p>
In Connecticut and the United States as a whole, just over 20% of children speak a language other than English at home.
<sup>
8
</sup>
In New Haven, the percent is much higher: 32.8 percent. This number gives us insight into the number of first and second-generation immigrants in our classroom. It also justifies the need to address this topic as educators.
</p>
<p>
Immigrant children come to us with a wide variety of educational backgrounds. Some who come fluent in English and are on par (or better than) American-born students in other subjects. Some are completely literate in their native country come with strong content knowledge. And others walk through our doors who have only attended school intermittently- or not at all. Students with unique linguistic and cultural backgrounds provide the rest of the class with a rich lesson in diversity.
</p>
<h3>
Strengths of Immigrants in the Classroom
</h3>
<p>
As educators, we know well that our students are unique and have different strengths and needs. Yet, immigrant communities do tend to share some characteristics. The courage needed to leave ones country and many times the trauma motivating it, often creates stronger communities as well as individuals with motivation to succeed. What follows are the strength and needs of the majority.
</p>
<p>
The challenges faced by immigrant students, and the obstacles we face as their teachers, are daunting. However, their strengths are a powerful force. Most of our immigrant students have two parents at home. Many times, they also have extended families either living with them or residing in the same neighborhood. They are also more likely to have at least one adult working fulltime. Immigrants often have a strong work ethic and have overcome great odds in order to accomplish their goals. They are resilient in the face of obstacles. These factors combine and create children who are less likely to engage in risky behavior.
<sup>

<h3>
Challenges for Immigrants in the Classroom
</h3>
<p>
When people emigrate from their native country, they often arrive having experienced profound trauma. This may have been the impetus for their move, but simply leaving the place where you were born, family, friends, and people with a shared history is also difficult. Many immigrants come to this country with skills that are not transferable to the job market here in New Haven. For example, most people who come from Mexico are farmers, yet agricultural work in our city is rare.
</p>
<p>
Fear of deportation, if immigrants are undocumented, can cause a huge amount of stress on a family. Parents may not know their rights in many areas but particularly in education. Anything having to do with the government is feared in many households. This is known as "stranger danger."
<sup>
10
</sup>
</p>
<p>
Adapting to a new culture with different norms is harder for adults than children. Children often acclimate faster than their parents and this can create a wedge in families. Additionally, when children acclimate faster than adults, the children become the link between two worlds as they help navigate through adult matters. This creates a kind of role reversal that is stressful for many parents. Some families are blended, meaning that at least one of the children is a citizen by birth.
</p>
<p>
Discrimination and dealing with resentments of some native-born Americans takes a huge toll. Blatant and subtle prejudice is easy to dismiss if you are not experiencing it. New Haven county in particular, has dealt with profound example of discrimination at very high levels in the government. (More on that to follow)
</p>
<p>
Finally, lack of healthcare is a major problem. Under the best of circumstances the system can be hard to navigate. If you are not proficient in English, do not know your rights, and are fearful of government institutions, expensive out-of- pocket preventative care is something easily overlooked.
</p>
<h3>
Stages of Second Language Acquisition
</h3>
<p>
There are five predictable stages of second language acquisition. How quickly a child passes through these stages depends on a variety of factors such as family involvement and stability, as well as the length of time in their native country.
</p>

<h3>
Teaching in Diverse Classrooms
</h3>
<p>
Before a teacher can create a strong community in a diverse classroom, he or she must first examine their own biases and preconceived notions on race, religion, and sexual orientation. Over 90% of teachers in public schools today are white and grew up in middle-class, English-speaking homes. Honestly examining assumptions one makes is the first step to building a classroom that embraces diversity. In the book, You Can't Teach What You Don't Know, (whose title is drawn from a quote from Malcolm X), Gary Howard describes his experience growing up in a predominantly white small town near Seattle, being accepted into Yale University, and moving to the predominately African American neighborhood called, "The Hill" during the race riots of the sixties. He describes four basics assumptions on social dominance:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>
1.
</td>
<td>
Human social systems are predisposed to form social hierarchies, with hegemonic groups at the top and negative reference at the bottom.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
2.
</td>
<td>
Hegemonic groups tend to be disproportionately male.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
3.
</td>
<td>
Most forms of social oppression, such as racism, sexism, and classism, can be viewed as manifestations of group-based social hierarchy.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
4.
</td>
<td>
Social hierarchy is a survival strategy that has been selected by many species of primates, including Homo sapiens.
<sup>
12
</sup>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
White educators need to understand how being born into the dominant culture influences our everyday actions in ways of which we are completely unaware. Students from minority cultures are hyper-aware, consciously or unconsciously, of any conformation of presumed superiority from the teacher or other students.
</p>
<h3>
Best Practices
</h3>
<p>
Teaching immigrants does not simply involve retooling strategies for other learners. It is important that teachers understand the role of culture and language in learning. Teachers will need to help students make connections to prior knowledge and build upon things they have learned in their native country. This constructivist view is not always practical, but the more it is done the more successful ELL students will be in acquiring critical thinking skills.

Teaching Immigration
</h2>
<h3>
Reading Research Data
</h3>
<p>
Literacy is not just about reading narrative text. Being able to read and interpret data from graphs and charts is also essential. Finding reliable information on immigration is almost as hard as its interpretation simply because it is an extremely polarizing topic in our country, and the world. Information on immigration can be presented in a way that favors one political view over another. The United States census has reams of data that students can investigate and draw conclusions. Opening the unit with a discussion about this topic will begin to prepare students for the ethical considerations with which they will grapple. Some questions to consider are:
</p>
<blockquote>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<dt>
See Lesson plans …
</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is not always easy to begin addressing questions like these. However this difficult subject is already playing out in many of our students'' lives. In an article titled, "The Class Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest" Laura Varlas wrote, "Rather than shy away from controversy in the classroom, teachers draw on edgy topics as an authentic opportunity to practice the critical thinking and social-emotional skills needed to debate sensitive issues.
<sup>
13
</sup>
</p>
<h3>
Immigrant Narratives
</h3>
<p>
After investigating the vast quantities of data on immigration, moving on to reading personal narratives will allow students, both native and immigrant, to get a clearer picture of the human condition. They will read examples of human suffering and triumph that will, ideally, give them a sense of the courage displayed by so many people we unknowingly encounter throughout our day.
</p>
<p>
One important thing to consider is that New Haven accepts refugees from over 70 different countries.
<sup>
14
</sup>
The United Nations' definition of refugee states that he or she a person with a
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.
<sup>
15
</sup>
</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
The majority of refugees in New Haven are from Iraq, Iran, Congo, Guinea, Burundi, Ghana, Liberia and Vietnam. There are a growing number of people seeking asylum from Syria. Asylum seekers are people whose problems have not yet been established as valid and may or may not become refugees. In addition, people from Haiti and Central American can be granted temporary refugee status because their native country cannot provide adequate living conditions due to national disasters.
<sup>
16
</sup>
</p>
<p>
There will be many questions that evolve from the readings and discussions.
</p>
<p>
See Lesson plans …
</p>
<h3>
Writing an Argument Essay
</h3>
<p>
There are subtle yet striking differences between persuasive writing and argument writing. Persuasive essays combine facts (logos) with emotion (pathos) in order to convince the reader. In an argument essay, the writer seeks to critically inform the reader, using facts from both sides of an issue, and thereby establishes credibility (ethos). The writer shares information that proves the topic is important to consider. The topic of immigration lends itself to both styles, but for the purpose of this task, students must thoroughly research a claim and present facts both sides in order for the reader to agree with his or her opinion.
</p>
<p>
New Haven has been on the national stage because of immigration issues, many times. Our former mayor proposed issuing undocumented immigrants identification cards. (Should undocumented immigrants be given privileges like voting?) The Yale Law School filed the first successful class action suit against the Department of Immigration and Customs Enforcement for practices involving deportation. (Do illegal immigrants have the same protections against things like arrests without warrants?) Finally, the FBI investigated and tried the East Haven Police Department on its policy condoning racial profiling. (Is racial profiling necessary to deter crime?) Students would have to research from both sides of an issue, identify reasons, and clearly state their opinion.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
Immigrant communities are transforming our school systems. Not acknowledging and addressing this trend will further disenfranchise students with already fragile connections to our educational systems and deprive the rest of the class the valuable opportunity to learn about our increasingly globalized world. New haven and its surrounding towns have made news on the national stage, in regards to immigration-both positively and negatively- many times. Bringing this debate into the classroom will create a stronger classroom community, foster pride, and teach a valuable lesson in tolerance. The push and pull factors from all over the world have shaped our city into the eclectic mix we see today. Teaching students about this aspect of our city will show them how much we have to be proud of and also inform them of the areas that they can help make better.

Lesson Plans
</h2>
<h3>
Different People
</h3>
<p>
I have implemented this lesson with a variety of different grades and the result is always profound.
</p>
<p>
Procedure:
</p>
<p>
The class is divided into two groups. In separate rooms, members of each group are given introvert or extrovert characteristics to role-play. For example, introvert characteristics would include quiet speech, not making eye contact, and wanting to stay in their group with hands at their sides. They are very serious. Extroverts, on the other hand, speak loudly with lots of hand gestures and make clear eye contact with others. They like to tell jokes and meet new people.
</p>
<p>
First the students are asked to pick a name for their group. This process brings them together and helps them see themselves as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Next they practice their characteristics. The teacher moves through the group and prompts them on their acting.
</p>
<p>
Once both groups are comfortable with their roles, the two groups are brought together and interact for a short period of time. This would be no longer than five minutes. They are then instructed to go back to their seats.
</p>
<p>
The teacher then calls on individual students to talk about how they felt when they met this new group of people and he or she writes them on the board. Each time I have done this lesson, the comments have been overwhelmingly negative, with participants expressing feelings of disrespect and even anger. Count or tally the positive and negative comments and ask students what conclusion they can draw from this social experiment.
</p>
<p>
The idea that most people have after this exercise and the purpose of it is to see that it is human nature to be distrustful of people we do not know, and with this knowledge, we are better prepared to meet and interact with people from a different culture.
</p>
<h3>
Lesson 2: Citizenship Test
</h3>
<p>
In order to become a U.S. citizen one must get at least seven out of ten question correct. There are 100 possible questions that range in difficulty from: "Who is the Commander in Chief" to "Name one of the writers of the Federalist Papers." The cost of the citizenship test is $680.00 and 92% of immigrants pass on their first try.
<sup>
17
</sup>
</p>
<p>
As a class, choose 10 questions and require students test 10 people who are citizens by right of their birth, outside of the classroom. Most times very few will pass.
</p>
<p>
When all the data is collected students can graph correct answers in a number of ways using the whole classes' data or just their own.
</p>
<p>
An added benefit to this is that students will have memorized these facts!
</p>
<h3>
Lesson 3: Interactive Map
</h3>
<p>
The New York Times has a beautiful interactive map that allows users to manipulate data on immigration trends since 1880.
<sup>
18
</sup>
Students can navigate this map by choosing different decades and countries of origin. They can then point to any county in America and learn the population for that date and the number of people born in that respective country.
</p>
<h3>
Lesson 4: Prezi

State Standards
</h3>
<p>
This unit was developed in accordance with Common Core State Standards. However, the integration of all or part of this unit will meet many general standards.
</p>
<p>
Reading for Information-Key Ideas and Details: Students will cite textual evidence to support analysis of what the text says explicitly as well as inferences drawn from the text. Students will analyze in detail how a key individual, event, or idea is introduced, illustrated, and elaborated in a text (e.g., through examples or anecdotes). Students will determine an author's point of view or purpose in a text and explain how it is conveyed in the text.
</p>
<p>
Reading for Information- Integration of Knowledge and Ideas: Students will integrate information presented in different media or formats (e.g., visually, quantitatively) as well as in words to develop a coherent understanding of a topic or issue.
</p>
<p>
Reading for Information- Literacy: Students will trace and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, distinguishing claims that are supported by reasons and evidence from claims that are not. Students will compare and contrast one author's presentation of events with that of another (e.g., a memoir written by and a biography on the same person).
</p>
<p>
Mathematics- Content: Students will display numerical data in plots on a number line, including dot plots, histograms, and box plots. Students will summarize numerical data sets in relation to their context and be able to report the number of observations. Students will describe the nature of the attribute under investigation, including how it was measured and its units of measurement.
</p>
<p>
Literacy in History and Social Studies-Key Ideas and Details: Students will cite specific textual evidence to support analysis of primary and secondary sources. Students will integrate visual information (e.g., in charts, graphs, photographs, videos, or maps) with other information in print and digital texts.

<h3>
Immigration in New Haven
</h3>
<p>
When the first immigrants arrived in New Haven, almost 400 years ago, they encountered a small tribe of war weary Native Americans. In return for this beautiful harbor, the Europeans promised the indigenous people sanctuary from marauding Mohawks.
<sup>
20
</sup>
Thus began our city's tenuous relationship between native and newcomer.
</p>
<p>
The turn of the 21
<sup>
st
</sup>
century found New Haven like most other industrialized cities. It required a labor force- and a cheap one- to keep the factory lines running. Winchester Repeating Arms needed 10,000 workers at its plant in what is now the Dixwell-Newhallville area. In 1909, New Haven produced 58.5% percent of our nation's firearms and ammunition, as well as 38.5 percent of its corsets.
<sup>
21
</sup>
This seemingly never-ending supply of labor, mainly from Ireland, Italy, and Eastern Europe flooded in New Haven. They joined a migration of African Americans from the south. Census statistics show that the percentage of "foreign-born whites" rose from 3,697 in 1850 to 45,686 in nineteen twenty.

<sup>

</sup>
</p>
<p>
In New Haven, Latinos citizens were the only group to increase in size between 2000 and 2010. They currently comprise 27.4% of the population, which is a 34.6% increase. That translates to 9,148 people, and brings the total of documented Hispanic immigrants to 35,591.
<sup>
25
</sup>
</p>
<p>
Though far smaller in number, the Asian population also increased: from 3.9 to 4.5 percent during this time. The African American and white populations have decreased and comprise 33.4 and 31.8 percent, respectively, of New Haven's population.
<sup>
26
</sup>
I found that verifiable data was hard to obtain between censuses.
</p>
<p>
But population size is only one factor to consider; language also plays a huge role in immigrants' experiences. In Connecticut 80% of students for whom English is a second language have Spanish as their native tongue. Connecticut is also home to the largest population of migrants from Puerto Rico.
<sup>
27
</sup>
Though they have some of the same challenges that other immigrants face, they are American citizens and therefore do not always qualify for immigration-related government services.
</p>
<p>
New Haven is immigrant rich. Over twenty-seven percent of residents identify themselves as Hispanic;
<sup>
28
</sup>
thirteen percent is the national average.
<sup>
29
</sup>
One of the many ways in which people divide themselves is by their families' country of origin. Many of our students first understanding that they can belong to a different community is learning about their heritage. Examining immigration trends in New Haven will give us all a better appreciation of our city.
