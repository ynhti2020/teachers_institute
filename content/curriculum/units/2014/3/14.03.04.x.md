grade students at a predominantly African American, Intra-District Magnet High School. This is an inclusive educational environment, and my role as a PPT Chairperson is to provide support for special needs students with challenging behaviors and low-academic performance.  This is an alternative placement, where students come from "sending schools" throughout the district, where they have experienced very little success in their educational environments. Our school diversity is as following, 71% African Americans, 28 % Hispanic, and 1 % white with a total of 99% minority enrollment. At our school, the students flourish and benefit from a small and flexible learning environment, a nurturing administration, as well as having the opportunity to build on small successes. Our mission statement is that the staff will engage, value, challenge, and provide success to all of our students. Our vision is that our students can grow to higher levels of achievement in spite of other challenges that they face.
</p>
<p>
Good things are already happening at our school.  We provide a mentor program, volunteer service credit program, shadowing and internship opportunities, Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) and Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) training programs, school to career counseling, flexible scheduling, smaller class sizes, individualized attention, community support for the student and family, and leadership training with emphasis on character, growth and future planning. Our graduation rate deserves mentioning; out of 66 graduates, 63 pursued higher education.
</p>
<p>
As a History teacher, I found that the students are lacking knowledge in many turning points in American history, including knowing about efforts of a pan-humanistic organization like the NAACP.  When I asked the question "who can tell me about the NAACP?" Only one student said that he had heard of the group. I realized there was a disconnect of the past with  my students while they were watching the documentary, Little Rock, 50 years later. Over sixty years ago, Little Rock Central High School became a symbol of the struggles and hopes of the Civil Rights Movement in regards to education. The NAACP played an imperative part in providing legal support and advocacy to integrate schools.
</p>
<p>
The disconnection exists when discussing the past role of this organization and many Civil Rights activities. I recognize that students don't see the advantages in fighting for civil liberties until it directly affects their welfare. One of my students asked,"Why is the NAACP needed at this time?"  He stated, "Black people don't have the same problems now, like back then". It occurred to me that this could be a "teachable moment", and an excellent opportunity for the students to answer, "Is the NAACP needed at this time?" This unit will explore the history of the NAACP's landmark cases concerning Racial injustice in Education and Mass Incarceration. The students will determine the present needs of the organization, if any, and debate about whether the organization is necessary at this time.
</p>
<p>
"Is the NAACP needed at this time? The NAACP has been very successful in making major changes in this nation. Their track record speaks for itself, an organization that took on both policy and cultural concerns. No other organization can compare to the NAACP with promoting civil liberties for the citizens of color in the United States. The past need for the organization has been to address white racism in the school house, court house, jail house, Black house (African-American Community) and in the White house. The idea of the American Dream did not include all Americans until the NAACP fought for equal opportunity through racial justice and integration. The NAACP's vision reflected the principles that the Constitution was founded on; which demands Justice for All. Some of their successful outcomes were:

1958     The NAACP's string of legal victories caught the attention of the Eisenhower administration's IRS, which forced it to split its Legal Defense Fund into a separate organization. Deep South state governments such as that of Alabama also cited the "state's rights" doctrine as a basis for restricting the personal freedom of association guaranteed by the First Amendment, banning the NAACP from legally operating within their jurisdiction. The Supreme Court took issue with this, and ended state-level NAACP bans in the landmark NAACP v. Alabama (1958).

Is the NAACP needed at this time?  A poll was given to my two classes on this question; the poll revealed14% said yes the NAACP is needed at this time, and 86% indicated the NAACP was not needed at this time. That is a pretty "commanding" class response, and when asked why or why not? The students responded that African Americans  have progressed on many levels since the inception of the NAACP. African Americans have better chances in employment, education, housing and legal representation. They don't have visual reminders like signs posted stating "Whites Only". Interracial marriages and relationships are common, and more African Americans are on TV, pursing higher education, winning in politics, and controlling Corporate America.  I suspect why the students believe the NAACP is not relevant is because their issues are different now, like hunger, poverty and parenting, or other things that the NAACP has no special ability to speak to such as cyber bullying.  The fear of being lynched is a thing of the past, and African Americans can roam the streets freely without being attacked by white Klansmen. Churches are not being bombed, and they see very little racial disparity in healthcare, schools and transportation. African Americans are now part of the upper and middle class social economic status, and Black pride is very popular within the community.
</p>
<p>
Today, the education system is a vivid reminder of the complicated road to equality, because African American students are still in crisis when compared to other students in surrounding districts. In many districts, white students matriculate to some of the most prestigious colleges in the country, while many African American students cannot pass basic reading requirements. In a world that is technology driven, why are the affluent communities resources more advance than the low performing schools?  Schools which do not have comparable resources to the affluent schools are failing the students.  The resources in question are resources such as science labs that assimilate walking on mars to having I-pads and smart boards in every classroom. For low income schools not to have access to these resources is a travesty to the educational system, and all students are not receiving equitable education. To be competitive in this society students need integration of resources and technology. The students will explore why or why not?
</p>
<p>
One of the major issues with school culture in 2000 is "cyber-bullying" and technology. Albert Einstein stated, "I fear the day that technology will surpass our human interaction.  The world will have a generation of idiots." But at my school, our mission is to meet students where they are.  Under these circumstances, school climate and culture must be restructured to address a wide range of student needs. The administration needs to be equipped with the tools to deal with students who are affected by homelessness and hunger, an increase of student suicide rate, influences of technology, suffering with their terminally-ill parents, parental abandonment, incarceration of students and parents, lack of respect for authority, and gun violence. Students have a need for security, self-esteem and belongingness. In addition, schools must instill in students a sense of community and participation that are sorely lacking in today's society. In the case of individual perception, I suggest inviting motivational speakers for career day, place posters up that reflect the positive images of the students, or have awards assemblies for small successes.  In the locus of control, administration can't change the environment, but can find resources in the community to help students to be successful in school. The NAACP needs to continue to push for legislation to integrate technology in all schools and services.

History of the NAACP
</h2>
<h3>
Then
</h3>
<p>
The National Association Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) grew out of race riots that occurred in Springfield, Illinois, in August 1908. In the beginning, the black people were in such a crisis, that a group of white liberals and socialists, and descendants of abolitionists called for a meeting to discuss racial injustice. When I discussed the NAACP with my students, they were amazed that the NAACP was started by a white socialist, William English Walling, who wrote a magazine article that called for the formation of a group to come to the aid of African Americans. Although there were many white separatists practicing hatred against people of African descent, there were white people who aided African Americans and fought against racial injustice too. The organization formerly known as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and now simply called, NAACP is the oldest and largest Civil Rights organization in the United States, and began initially to advocate for people of color, but branched out to assist all racial injustice.
</p>
<p>
Many forms of segregation that were being practiced before 1950 allowed Whites to be in control of the laws. African Americans were prohibited from using public restaurants, bathrooms transportation and to participate in voter's registration. Large signs were posted with "Whites Only", to prohibit African Americans from patronizing their businesses. These facilities were separate, and not nearly equal to the quality and standards of the establishments reserved for whites. The policy with the bus transportation was for African Americans to sit in the back of the bus, and if a white person needed the seating, African Americans were to give their seats up or be arrested. Many of my students will be familiar with the case concerning Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her seat for a white man, which sparked the Montgomery Bus Boycott. The Boycott was led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the NAACP. This case also was the beginning of the civil rights movement. On the 1st of December 1955, Rosa Parks caught a bus home from work in Montgomery, Alabama and put in jail. She was the secretary of the local NAACP, and news of what had happened quickly spread across Montgomery. Martin Luther King organized a successful non-violent protest through boycotting the buses. November 1956 the Supreme Court announced that segregation on buses was illegal. These laws that protected Whites, and separated them from Blacks were called the "Jim Crow Laws". (From Jim Crow to Civil Rights: The Supreme Court and the Struggle for Racial Equality, Klarman, Michael) Without having Blacks in politics to change legislation, these laws were enforced by Southern whites. In addition, voter registration fraud was a major factor in elections when African Americans were not allowed to vote due to technicalities and peer pressure.  Whites used literacy tests and other obstacles to stop the African American vote from being counted. Another way that was used to hinder voter registration (which was not that of a law) was social peer pressure. A statement from Janet Harris, a civil rights worker for the National Association for the Advancement of Colour People issued this: "A negro in the deep south who tried to register might lose his job or his credit. He might be beaten, have his house set on fire or be killed. 'I don't want my job cut off', one man explained. Another man was more blunt 'I don't want my throat cut' he said."  Threats of being killed by white supremacy groups like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and law enforcement presented to oppress the African American people for many years to come.
</p>
<p>
The NAACP has had many victories in landmark Supreme Court cases such as brown v. board of education (1954) and the sponsorship of grassroots social programs.  A Newsweek article, dated 5/14/14; Newsweek Rewind: 60 Years since Brown v. Board of Ed Desegregated U.S. Schools by Rob Verger, reported that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
"The Supreme Court, by unanimous vote, ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that separate schools for black and white Americans were not equal. The decision reversed the 1896 ruling in Plessy v. Ferguson, which had said that "separate but equal" was OK—and was, to say the least, a major setback for civil rights in the United States. People waited in line hoping to get a seat in the Supreme Court for the Brown v Board Education. While Newsweek reflected in 1954 that Brown v. Board of Ed would "ultimately…mean the end of segregation in all public places, everywhere in the United States," it would take another decade for the federal government, with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to make segregation in places like restaurants illegal."
</dt>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
The NAACP has been a leader in the effort to guarantee that African Americans and members of other racial minorities receive equal protection under the law. From the beginning, the NAACP made legal action on behalf of African Americans a top priority. It won early Supreme Court victories in Guinn v. United States, (1915), which overturned the Grandfather Clause as a means of disfranchising black voters, and in Buchanan v. Warley (1917), which barred municipal ordinances requiring racial segregation in housing. The grandfather clause imposed a literacy test on persons who were not entitled to vote prior to 1866. This meant that all slaves and their descendants had to pass a rigorous literacy test based on knowledge of the state constitution and other highly technical documents. Just recently, a Supreme Court case was decided here in New Haven, CT. The NAACP provided legal action for RICCI ET AL. v. DESTEFANO ET AL. (2009).  This case was argued that the City uses objective examinations to identify those firefighters best qualified for promotion. Few, if any, African Americans passed the literacy test in the early years of the NAACP; which hasn't changed much from what happened when the fire fighters completed their exams in New Haven, almost a century later.

Racial Injustice in Education
</h2>
<h3>
Then
</h3>
<p>
From the Civil War to Civil Rights, whites treated African Americans poorly, brutally, and savagely: solely, because of the color of their skin. African Americans were branded as second-class citizens, and they received the worst paying jobs; education, homes and legal representation.  During the 1950's, there were many disadvantages for African Americans, and the nation was so crippled with blatant racism and violence. African Americans were discriminated against in many public and private services, as well as restaurants and schools. They were expected to attend schools with large class sizes, and received books that were used and abused, opposite to their white counterparts where the resources were current and class size much more manageable. Also, the white schools had well-trained teachers, while the African American schools were staffed with untrained and poor teaching.  One of the landmark cases that the NAACP was involved in was Brown v. Board of Education. The case addressed the issue of segregation and whether an African American girl, Linda Brown could attend a local, all-white school. Linda had to walk over twenty blocks to get to her school in Topeka even though there was a neighborhood school. On May 19, 1954, The Supreme Court determined that the constitution was "color-blind". The outcome of this lengthy battle led the Supreme Court ordering the Topeka Board of Education to end segregation in its schools. My students will be able to determine why the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954 case had an effect on public schools under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment of the U.S. Constitution; which prohibits states from denying any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Probably no 20

century Supreme Court decision so deeply stirred and changed life in the United States as Linda Brown. Many towns and cities began to desegregate their schools. Often the most run-down African American schools were simply closed down, and the children were sent to the nearest white school. Although the desegregation is what African American people were aiming for, it brought along with it several condemnations, mainly angry white people. When Clinton, Tennessee began to integrate its Central High School in 1956, massive riots broke out. Brown itself was not a single case, but rather a collective group of five lawsuits against school districts in Kansas, South Carolina, Delaware, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.  As indicated in Micheal Klarman's book, From Jim Crow to Civil Rights, Thurgood Marshall, an attorney for the NAACP, litigated these cases over the next two decades.  Marshall recruited Constance Baker Motley, a New Haven native to assist him in litigating these cases.  Marshall's summation of the case focused on segregation and discrimination. He completed his summation emphasizing that segregation was rooted in the desire to keep "the people who were formerly in slavery as near to that stage as is possible."
</p>
<p>
There are many accounts of the horrific ordeals that the students had to encounter while courageously integrating schools in the south. By researching the events of the Little Rock Nine, and examining how the NAACP fought to integrate schools, my focus will be to assist my students in valuing education and developing empathy for the pioneers of the integration movement. One of the Little Rock Nine, Melba Patillo Beals explains in her book, "Warriors Don't Cry", her dramatic battle to integrate Little Rock's Central High School. Beals writes compassionately by using her diaries and the current media coverage to provide an account; and a re-creation of her devastating walk through the halls of Central High School. The backlash of Brown v. Board of Education's decision carried with it more than the opportunity to attend school with white children, and integration had its price. One of the newspapers reported that, "one of Little Rocks Nine, Ernest Greene's diploma cost taxpayers half a million dollars", but Melba said it cost them much much more.  "It cost them their innocence and a precious year of their teenage lives." Her home was her shelter and refuge, and other times she felt like it was a prison. She lost her friends from her former school, and reverted her to exhibit low self-esteem. She felt inferior to white people and invaluable to her race. Also, it cost these students embarrassment, jobs, foreclosures, bruises, cuts and scars. Beal's book will be used to examine some of the NAACP's strategy meetings that were held to create their master plan for integration, as well as to understand how important the media coverage was then and is to our society today.

Criminal injustice/ Mass Incarceration
</h2>
<h3>
Then
</h3>
<p>
From not being allowed drinking out of water fountains to where to sit on the bus, were some of the burdens for African Americans during the early fight for equality; but African Americans were being faced with another obstacle.  "Slavery ended a long time ago, but the institution of chattel slavery and the ideology of racial subordination that accompanied it have cast a long shadow." (Glenn C. Loury, Race, Incarceration, and American Values) What we are seeing now is a continuation of mass incarceration as another form of slavery. African Americans are twice as likely as whites to be arrested for the same crimes. It is important for the students to realize that equality was the problem, but without the assistance of Black leaders, like WEB Dubois, Malcolm X, Medger Evers, who sacrificed their lives for the struggle, the student can use public transportation without having the fear of being arrested for where they sit. In contrast to the 1950's the youth were not killing each other, but trying to avoid being killed by lynching mobs. DuBois, the first African American to receive a Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1896, and other NAACP members like Ida B. Wells, organized a movement denouncing lynching and mob violence against blacks. The anti-lynching movement was another civil rights movement to eradicate the practice of lynching. After the lynching of her three friends, Ida condemned the lynching in two newspapers owned by her, Free Speech and Headlight. African-American women helped in the formation of the movement
<sup>
</sup>
and the movement was successful largely because of their involvement. The movement was composed mainly of African Americans who tried to persuade politicians to put an end to the practice, but after the failure of this strategy, they pushed for anti-lynching legislation. Du Bois carried his message to the political arena when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 1951 on the American Labor Party's ticket. Throughout the 1950s, Du Bois' concerns became increasingly international, and he traveled and lectured on a number of issues including disarmament and the future of Africa. "May 17, 1954 marks a defining moment in the history of the United States.  On that day, the Supreme Court declared the doctrine of "separate but equal" unconstitutional and handed NAACP the most celebrated victory in its storied history. DuBois founded The Crisis Magazine, and it is published quarterly to bring awareness to civil rights, history, politics, and culture and seeks to educate and challenge its readers about the issues that continue to plague African Americans and other communities of color.   The students will peruse the old and new Crisis Magazines to compare, analyze and interpret information about how the African American people were in crisis, and if they continue to be in crisis.
</p>
<p>
I concur that the Civil Rights movement was very successful throughout the 1960's. The efforts and lives of African Americans and White Americans were always challenged in the movement for equality, but major changes took place in our society; like drugs and increase in crime. But in the 1990's it was "the age of drive-by shootings, drug deals gone bad, crack cocaine, and gangsta rap" as mentioned in Loury's book, Race, Incarceration, and American values.  Between 1960-1990 the annual number of murders in New Haven rose from 6 to 31, the number of rapes from 4 to 168, the number of robberies from 16 to 1,784, all this while the city's population declined by 14 percent."
</p>
<p>
Several people had been killed throughout the process to gain equality in our communities and schools. Living in peace and harmony had been achieved through major supreme court decisions by giving African Americans more power and rights. African Americans now have more of a chance of changing and leading America in unity. African American people had been set free from the social restraints and had the chance to make a difference in their lives. But the attack on race has moved from the "colored water fountain and the back of the bus to the profiling moment and the prison cell". There are more than two million people imprisoned in the United States according to Jones, Mauer, and Alexander, "Race to Incarcerate: A Graphic Retelling," which is the highest rate of incarceration in the world. This book focuses on with the massive incarceration in communities of color.  If current trends continue, one of every three black males and one of every six Latino males born today can expect to do time in prison.  The alarming facts are "African-Americans are stopped, ticketed, searched and/or arrested by the police at far higher rates than whites, and many of them are law-abiding citizens. Relative to their rates of arrest and participation in crime, African-Americans are represented within U.S. jails and prisons at unreasonably high rates. Indeed, within a decade of Warren McCleskey, an African-American man who was sentenced to death in 1978 for killing a white police officer during the robbery of a Georgia furniture store, the number of minority citizens in prison exceeded the total number of persons incarcerated in the U.S. in the year preceding the decision." Loury agrees that the American criminal justice has become crueler and less caring than it has been at any other time in our modern history, and so does the dozen of men tell their accounts in, 12 Angry Men:  True Stories of Being a Black Man in America Today, Edited by Gregory S. Parks and Matthew W. Hughey. In this book, 12 Angry Men, a dozen men expressed their feelings about racial profiling which is still routinely done to African-American males. The writer gives a variety of accounts on how the men were stopped-and-frisked, and unlawfully detained just because of the color of their skin. Looking through the lens of these twelve angry men and empathizing with the pain that they had to endure like embarrassment and fear, their anger is understandable and justifiable.

In 2004, in Louisiana Supreme Court, A judge exhibited racist behavior by dressing up at a Halloween party as an inmate with wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and handcuffs, a black afro wig, and blackface makeup. His behavior was determined that that the portrayal of "African-Americans in a racially stereotypical manner . . . perpetuated the notion of African-Americans as both inferior and as criminals," and "called into question . . . his ability to be fair and impartial toward African-Americans who appear before his court as defendants in criminal proceedings." This judge was suspended and later placed back on the bench in spite of his deplorable behavior. But in Georgia, McCleskey appealed his conviction and sentence. According to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia McCleskey v. Kemp, was a United States Supreme Court case, in which the death penalty sentencing of Warren McCleskey for armed robbery and murder was upheld. The Court said the "racially disproportionate impact" in Georgia death penalty indicated by a comprehensive scientific study was not enough to overturn the guilty verdict without showing a "racially discriminatory purpose."
<sup>
</sup>
He relied on the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment and the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of Equal Protection to argue that the death penalty in Georgia was administered in a racially discriminatory -- and therefore unconstitutional--manner. "
</p>
<h3>
Now
</h3>
<p>
Today, the population that the NAACP serves is very urban and underserved, so there are a lot of social needs like, housing, benefits food stamps, and healthcare. James Rawlings, the president of the local NAACP, is very passionate about keeping African American culture and traditions alive for generations to come.  As a youth, he lived in a city where the "establishment" didn't really allow African-Americans to go into non-minority communities, and he recognizes the needs of the New Haven community at large. Following a passion he still holds today and under his leadership for the past eight years, many programs and initiatives have been established. Rawlings and the NAACP formed the branch's first health committee and created a report on health disparities that helped establish the state's Commission on Health Equity.  New Haven Register reported that one of Rawlings' favorite branch achievements is the health care career fairs that expose middle and high school students to a world of health care careers other than being a doctor or a nurse.  In addition to a mortgage program that has turned 15 renters into homeowners, other developments were established like an annual scholarship program, a $7.5 million community investment program, and a fund for entrepreneurs, an economic summit, an "Urban Apartheid" report that used data to show racial inequities in several areas, the college branches and mobilizing youth for marches.  The Urban Apartheid data revealed many challenges minorities face and which focuses on challenges in education, economic equity, healthy neighborhoods, and civic engagement around New Haven. Some of disturbing issues are the same struggles the NAACP have been addressing for the last 200 years." This report also reveals that the minorities are branded as a permanent under-class with very little opportunities of advancement to the upper class.  The New Haven Independent Newspaper reported that Rawlings stated "the underclass is mostly non-white and concentrated in poor urban neighborhoods. For children growing up in such situations, "knowing where they're born, we know they have no future." Also, according to the New Haven Independent Newspaper:
</p>
<p>
- Black New Haveners lag 40 points behind white peers on reading tests, have half the average income of white families, and are concentrated together in struggling neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>
- In New Haven, 66 percent of white students are reading at goal level by third grade, versus 26 percent of black students.
</p>
<p>
- Ninety-eight percent of families with incomes of over $50,000 have access to the internet, versus 78 percent of families below that income level, in greater New Haven.
</p>
<p>
- Twelve percent of minorities say they have trouble paying their rent or mortgage, versus just 4 percent of non-minorities in the greater New Haven metropolitan area.
</p>
<p>
- Median income for black families in New Haven County has dropped $9,000 since 2008, compared to a drop of less than $3,000 for white families, who have an average income that's nearly twice as high as black families.
</p>
<p>
- Black people have less access to transportation, and thus have less access to jobs and longer commutes when they do have jobs.
</p>
<p>
An emphasis needs to be placed on the importance of equal access to a good education to find a gateway out of poverty and hopelessness. W.E.B. Dubois penned, "To be a poor man is hard, but to be a poor race in a land of dollars is the very bottom of hardships." While discussing post-secondary plans with my students, a remark was made, "Why reach for the stars, when I see footprints on the moon!" His comment was very enlightened, knowing that he is a student who falls below the poverty level, and receives free reduced lunch because of his family income.
</p>
<p>
The educational and social issues are just as challenging today as yesterday, but our school system is faced with different social-ills than in the past. There is a crisis in New Haven where students are faced with mourning the loss of their classmates and love ones. The students are connected to the community through their neighborhood environment or family involvement.  When there is a "shooting" in the area, school safety and welfare becomes a major concern. New Haven has had nine shooting victims in six separate incidents from May 10 to May 19, 2014.  Although the NAACP has a lot to boost about, the need is greater in the inner city, which is plague with a rash of gun violence.  There is a lack of "GOD fearing youths" in the New Haven community, with no value of life, no empathy and no conscious about doing wrong. This is evident by the senseless killings, which leaves the community in constant fear of an on-going retaliation among the neighborhood rifts, and family and friends.  Some of the students are lacking home training in civil disobedience and the importance of citizenship, and the good deeds of students are not often celebrated.  Never before has such a demand been placed on schools, even schools that are lacking financially. The students' basic needs outside of school aren't being met; which have lead to retention.  How do instructional leaders change dysfunctional families, increase parental involvement, or make schools safe from gangs and violence? Students are experiencing life tragedies and are forced to face real world issues before they complete high school.  Many lack the necessities of life like: food, shelter and clothing. Schools must increasingly serve as safe havens for students, many whom come from dysfunctional families and neighborhoods. Even today, the work of Brown is continue to be addressed, and over 200 school desegregation cases remain open on federal court dockets. Recent Supreme Court decisions have made it harder to achieve and maintain school desegregation.  As a result of these developments and other factors, public school children are more racially isolated now than at any point in the past four decades.  This regression makes it even more critical to continue defending the principles articulated in Brown and leading the ongoing struggle to provide an equal opportunity to learn for children in every one of our nation's classrooms.  In 2008, when President Obama was Senator, he made a speech in Philadelphia, "segregated schools were, and are, inferior schools 50 years after Brown v. Board of Education – and the inferior education they provided, then and now; helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students."

African Americans have made significant gains during this century, victorious in the election of a Black president as well as many Supreme Court decisions. When there is opposition, there is opportunity. The greater the opposition, the greater is the opportunity. The students must understand that freedom is not free, and many people had to pay the cost. They sacrificed their lives so students can have futures not funerals. I would like to see a movement like the anti-lynching movement to be in effect against gun violence in the community. I believe the NAACP has the resources for the elimination of racial discrimination through lobbying, legal action, and education.
</p>
<p>
I struggle with ways to teach my students how difficult it was for African Americans after slavery.  That so many have fought for freedoms that they take for granted, like where they eat, where they study and whom they study with. I personally never experienced being deprived intellectual commingling with other students, but I believe there are still hidden racist tactics that are being used by the admission process to schools in this present day and time.  Schools are using discriminatory practices to determine applicants through surnames which implicate their nationality or ethnicity.  Standardized testing is non-effective for assessment and higher performing schools are receiving the best resources for education.  The book "Fight for Freedom: History of the NAACP", by the great poet, Langston Hughes is an old book, not particularly well know, but one of the most riveting, compelling books and compulsory reading for all students. Respectfully, it is unfortunate that so many of our youth are so painfully unaware of the history of the NAACP.  I would have the students collect data on the challenges facing African Americans (or blacks in New Haven) today.  The class will debate; conduct interviews and exam case histories pertaining to past and present civil liberties v civil rights decisions. The students will be able to attend college debates like the Yale University v. Morehouse College; these teams were debating Gun Control and the efficacy of Charter Schools during the Connecticut NAACP 5th Annual Great Debate April 11, 2013.  The debate will be used as a dramatic demonstration to encourage participation from the entire school population.
</p>
<p>
It's imperative that we educate our youth about the struggle. How can we develop young freedom fighters if they feel the fight is over? Hopefully, we are beyond the stage where dolt behavior is occurring. As some people say, "If you want to hide something from a black person, put it in a book".   Having said that, I believe just as they say, "ignorance of the law is no excuse", so too, ignorance of one's history is never an excuse.   The Jewish people do not allow it, Why should African Americans? Juan Perea, Richard Delgado, Angela Harris, Jean Stefancic, and Stephanie Wildman's book, Race and Races: Cases and Resources for a Diverse America, presents a critical perspectives on race and racism. It also provides expanded treatment of Japanese-American internment, Jewish Americans, and native Hawaiians in the U.S. This book is an awesome resource to use when presenting cases such as Grutter and Virginia v. Black, current statistics, and enhanced coverage of voting. The students will be able to make connections and linkages to other nationalities other than their own by using cases as a tool to ignite conversation about the treatment of major racial groups in the United States: African Americans, Indians, Latinos/Latinas, Asian Americans, and Whites. The book contains information that explores implications of enslavement, conquest, colonization, and immigration, as well as on equality, education, freedom of expression, family and sexuality, stereotyping, and crime, all areas of interest to support the question, is the NAACP needed at this time?  The purpose of this curriculum unit is to educate students, as well as make connections to increase relevancy for students, including connections to different lessons, to different content areas, and to each student's world outside of the classroom. The students will learn about how the African American people were in crisis, and if they continue to be in crisis.

Is the NAACP needed at this time? Education Inequality and Disparities in Connecticut
</h3>
<p>
Our school profile and schoolnet data demonstrated that the suspension rate and poor attendance have increased for the 2013 school year. School and class attendance, suspensions, expulsions and dropout rates are increasing in New Haven schools.  According to an online news source, the New Haven Independent (December 13, 2013) article by Melissa Bailey reported that the dropout rate is rising in New Haven.  The high school dropout rate for the Class of 2013 rose from 20.7 to 22.9 percent, and the four year graduation rate fell slightly, from 70.0 to 70.3 percent. Many of the students are "giving up" the very same freedoms that the NAACP fought for over two centuries. This curriculum will be used to ignite a dialogue about NAACP: Then and Now, and its efforts in the elimination of racial discrimination through lobbying, legal action, and education.

Not much has changed since the "Little Rock Nine" and New Orleans' "stand alone" student Ruby Bridges, as she courageously crossed their school's steps during the infamous Integration Crisis in the 50's.  Several recent court opinions speak volumes like Sheff vs. O'Neill.  An arduous journey was started in 1989 by Elizabeth Horton Sheff of Connecticut, when her son, Milo, was a fourth grade student at Annie Fisher Elementary School in Hartford. She felt he wasn't receiving the level of education as other students. Elizabeth joined with ten other families to redress the inequity between the level of education provided to students in Hartford public schools and that was available to children in surrounding suburban districts. This journey has become known around the State of Connecticut, and throughout the United States, as Sheff vs. O'Neill–a landmark civil rights effort that seeks to prepare all children to live and prosper in an increasingly diverse, globally connected world. Still Hartford has exhibited problems within their educational system.  Hartford parents are divided on integrating CT's schools. On January 16, 2014, Jacqueline Rabe Thomas stated that nearly half the students from Hartford now attend integrated schools as reported in The CT Mirror News article.  Another article with Alvin Chang, "By the numbers: Integrating schools in CT", Jacqueline reported;
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
"Over the last 10 years, the state has spent about $2.5 billion to offer Hartford students enrollment in an integrated school. Most of the state's spending has gone toward opening new magnet schools in the region to encourage Hartford minority students and white students from the suburbs to enroll. These efforts follow the Connecticut Supreme Court's ordering the state 17 years ago -- in its ruling in the Sheff v. O'Neill lawsuit -- to eliminate the inequities that exist because of Hartford's largely minority-student population." Despite these efforts and all the changes, more than half of all Hartford's 21,000 students continue to attend segregated schools, a term used when more than three-quarters of a school's student population are members of minority groups. And, as John Logan, a sociology professor at Brown University, reported to state legislators this month, a comparison of Connecticut's metro areas to those of most other metro areas in the country show that black and Hispanic students are more segregated in the Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk area, the New Haven-Milford area and in Hartford than most other cities."

<h3>
Is the NAACP needed at this time? Criminal Injustice/ Mass Incarceration
</h3>
<p>
As studied by many sociologists, "A black male resident of the state of California is more likely to go to a state prison than a state college."  Tyranny and the sense of fear have always affected African-Americans, from 12 Years A Slave to 12 Angry Black Men. The NAACP has handled many landmark cases, like McCleskey v Kemp, Brown v. Board of Education, RICCI ET AL. v. DESTEFANO ET AL. (2009) just to name a few, but their work is their work finished yet? People play fair on the basketball court, because the rules are clear, but when the NBA is investigating LA Clipper's owner Donald Sterling for alleged racist comments about Black people, the NBA is in trouble and this nation still has a long way to go to stop racism. Prisons are being built up while schools are being torn down. Black on Black crime is at an all time high, in this country. The oppressors are still using literacy tests, employment discrimination, economic injustice, incarceration, and segregation to provide an inferior life-style for African-Americans.
</p>
<p>
From state to state, African Americans were being victimized solely for their skin color. Studies show that that African-Americans were more likely to receive a death sentence than any other defendants, and that African-American defendants who killed white victims were the most likely to be sentenced to death.  Numerous studies conducted in the 20 years that followed McCleskey have shown that race continues to play a critical role in virtually all aspects of the criminal justice process. In 2006 a study on Punishment and Inequality in America by sociologist Bruce Weston, his findings were "that the extent of racial disparity in imprisonment rates is greater than in any other major arena of American social life; at eight to one, the black-white ratio of incarceration rates dwarfs the two-to-one ratio of employment…while 3 out of 200 young whites were incarcerated in 2000, the rate for young blacks was 1 in 9." Loury also believes that mass incarceration has now become a principal vehicle for the reproduction of racial hierarchy in our society.
