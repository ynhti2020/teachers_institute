The units which are contained here reflect the broad range of topics which were discussed in the seminar. The transmission of genes involves large random components, and thus the unit on probability. Almost half of the units deal with presenting a basic understanding of heredity (and

<p>
its molecular basis) to students. Discussions of the molecular architecture of viruses and protein polymers led to a second mathematical unit on geometry. Finally, two of the units present topics in sociology and anthropology.
