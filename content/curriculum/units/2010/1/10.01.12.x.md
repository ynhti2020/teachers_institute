These are a few of the questions that came to my mind as I browsed websites of French fast-food restaurants. Everyone loves food, and if they don't love a particular food item, they certainly enjoy telling the world how much they dislike it. Language students seem to derive even more pleasure from this act of declaring personal preference since they get to do it in another language; for some reason, they can't get enough of that! It is not only human nature but also very much in the nature of teens and preteens to be drawn to the familiar, so I knew that creating a unit around well-known American fast-food chains that have become popular in France would be a winning combination, a virtual value-meal, if you will, for my middle school French students.
<p>
Perhaps because of this affinity for sameness, when students, especially of this age, first learn about another culture, they are often quite consumed by the lack of similarities, by the differences they see. As our students struggle to place themselves in the world, it is often easier for them to discover first who or what they are not before they understand who or what they are. This lens of difference can make it more difficult for them to spot the often numerous similarities between themselves and whichever "other" is being examined. When teaching a new language, those similarities can be quite powerful tools to help students relate to and remember vocabulary and concepts as they explore the people, places, and products of the culture. Teaching students to be similarity-spotters will not only help them develop the interpersonal ability to relate to other people, but it will also help them develop the skills necessary to use context clues to determine word meaning, and to develop a deeper understanding of written and visual texts, in the target language (in this case, French) as well as in English. (1)
</p>
<p>
This unit will introduce students to American and French fast-food restaurants in order to engage students in the process of discovering the variety of similarities and differences among French and American fast-food offerings and advertising, in addition to learning vocabulary and seeing real-world examples of things like the different punctuation with which numbers are written in France and the euro system of currency. We will explore McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken, two American fast-food restaurant chains, as well as the European chain Quick, to gather different perspectives on the fast-food scene in France.

<h2>
Consumer Culture, Fast-Food Restaurants, and Our Students
</h2>
<p>
Though definitely not a classroom-friendly film, anyone who saw the movie Pulp Fiction knows that the Big Mac in France is called the Royal; but what you might not realize is how much local taste and cuisine factor into the menu offerings at American fast-food chains abroad. At first, the French resisted what they felt to be a global-market domination strategy on the part of McDonald's. Get 'em in, get 'em out, and open up more and more locations to get more and more people in and out. But this Americanization campaign wasn't working in France, so the corporation decided that an image makeover was in order. To help change that image, McDonald's revamped its bright red and yellow color palette to one warmer and more muted, offered free WiFi, and endeavored to make the environment more "cozy," one in which the customer would like to linger, rather than rush through. They also offered more locally-desired food choices, like salads, local cheeses, and yogurts. U.K. Guardian reporter Andrew Shanahan refers to this process as "removing the fast" and "changing the food" aspects of fast food (Shanahan 2008).
</p>
<p>
France has long been known for its haute cuisine, lending to the English language much of the vocabulary used to discuss and deal in fine dining. Gastronomy, the art or science of good eating; gourmet, a connoisseur of fine food and drink; connoisseur, a discerning judge of the best in any field; gourmand, a person who is fond of good eating, soufflé, a light baked dessert requiring such an amplitude of both finesse and time to prepare that it requires pre-ordering when dining out and must be delivered within five minutes of being finished, lest it start to "fall," or deflate, and crack. (2) It only follows that in order to really plant roots in France, McDonald's would have to make some changes to both the food and the dining experience it provided in France. To do that while still maintaining the value, convenience, and uniformity of the fast-food experience is the challenge McDonald's has faced and indeed risen to in order to become successful in France.
</p>
<p>
When I was growing up, my mother always repeated the popular catch phrase "Flame-broiling beats fried" to explain why she favored Burger King over McDonald's, and why everyone else should too. What's funny is that I grew up about 30 minutes from ANY fast-food chain restaurant (Wendy's) and both Burger King and McDonald's were just under an hour away. These chains didn't seem to play any part in our daily lives, except that they did, as my mother and I spent much of our time together watching television, and thus (since this was before the age of the digital video recorder and forwarding through them) commercials. So when we took the hour-trip to the mall or visited family several hours away, these spots were our weigh station, so to speak. It was a treat to go, to be able to actually order something you had seen discussed in great detail in television commercials, to eat the sesame seed bun and special sauce at McDonald's, to see if Wendy's is really where the beef was located.
</p>
<p>
These fast-food restaurants were where I first became conscious of consumer choice, that the things a person liked and ate (or owned, wore, used) might mean something about who that person was. It is possible that eating at Burger King was not just a meal for my mother, but an indication that she knew a thing or two about differing levels of quality food, someone able to enjoy the culinary delights of both the filet mignon and the Whopper with cheese. At the time, I was young and so mostly interested in whatever incarnation of a milkshake was offered, and what type of prize I would get. But later, I would become enchanted with the idea of consumer empowerment, of being able to seek, find, and purchase items advertised on television that were not available in my small town. It made me a go-getter in my eyes, an independent person who saw what she wanted and made it happen. Little did I know that I was playing right into the hands of the advertisers, that I was pursuing what they wanted me to pursue, molding myself into a happy little consumer of whatever their advertisements were peddling!
</p>
<p>
In the Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute seminar entitled Interdisciplinary Approaches to Consumer Culture, we learned and discussed many different ways that what people buy affects and relates to who they are. In anthropologist Daniel Miller's The Comfort of Things, we saw how someone's possessions (or lack thereof) communicate something about who they are. The book introduces the reader to thirty people through the unique and personal stories they told when questioned about items they owned, as well as through the author's observations about those belongings in the context of their houses.
</p>
<p>
If, as the saying goes, my body is my temple, then I think it fair to say that the things I choose to put inside it may tell a story, just as the things in my house can. In the same way that Daniel Miller explores the personal items stored in each person's home, we can consider the body as home, and as such, we can explore the items (foods) that we eat and drink for the stories they tell about us. Why people make healthful or unhealthful choices in their diets is a conversation worth initiating. Inspiring students to begin to consider such things can have long-lasting effects on their health and well-being. This unit can provide the backdrop to begin such questioning, as subtly or explicitly as you see fit within the confines of your language communication goals. (3)
</p>
<p>
In Purchasing Power:  Black Kids and American Consumer Culture, ethnographer Elizabeth Chin follows a group of young kids from a struggling neighborhood in New Haven, Connecticut as they shop at the local mall, documenting what they buy and who they buy it for. The kids shop with money provided by Chin, that is, money that is not already spoken for by their families; each child gets $20, and it is quite interesting to read as they reason out how to best maximize those dollars, for themselves as well as for their family. Their purchasing choices say something about who these children are, whether one wants to be helpful and buy school supplies to alleviate that need for the parent, or another wants to be thoughtful and buy shoes to replace ones a parent gave to her when she needed a new pair, or another who want to be stylish without being a bother and so uses the opportunity to buy a cute little personal accessory to wear. But all are conscious of the choices they must make, that their purchasing dollar can be used for a variety of purposes above and beyond acquiring items.
</p>
<p>
So kids make choices every day about either what they consume or what they wish they were consuming, if only they had the money, the permission, the access, the option. While this unit is not intended to completely reveal each child's reasons for every choice, it is hoped that it will lead students to start examining and considering their choices and maybe even to inspire them to change some of those choices occasionally. It is fundamentally a language and communication unit, and that goal of comprehensible, level-appropriate conversation will always be first. But while we are pursuing and participating in that goal, I believe that students will be able to consider their own feelings about not only if they like le Big Mac or if they think they would like le Croque McDo if they tried it, but also how they feel about the choices offered in both places. Do they prefer the French or American menu, and why? Which do they think is the healthier choice of two or three given options, and why?
</p>
<p>
Students will specifically examine the kid's meals at our three locations to decide what is most important to them in a kid's meal offering. Is it variety? Cost? Healthy options? A toy? Packaging? Quantity of food? Again, we don't expect to knock the kids out with the findings, just to get them to start thinking about these things, while discussing their options in French!
</p>

<h2>
Objectives
</h2>
<p>
In this unit, students will:  Engage in conversation about fast-food items, menus, and advertising, including exchanging opinions (about food items, restaurants, and what to eat at each meal) considering reasons for those opinions (taste, smell, appearance, whether or not you have had it/been there before, whether you like trying new things), ordering items and asking companions what they would like to order. They will also:  Understand and interpret fast-food menus, websites, advertisements, and lists of menu foods; acquire and use information from a variety of sources only available in the world language, using technology (interactive websites and menus), print (printed menus and print ads), and audiovisual media (videoclips of commercials); begin to demonstrate an understanding of the concept of culture through comparisons of French and American fast food.
</p>
<p>
In order to offer the most useful information to anyone using this unit in his or her own classes, I will expand upon a different method of approaching the content in each section. In this way, I hope to provide a variety of options from which may be chosen those deemed most inspiring, relevant, or supportive by each teacher based on the particular strengths and needs of that teacher's classes.
</p>
<p>
As for me, I teach grades five through eight at an arts magnet middle school in New Haven, Connecticut. The seventh and eighth-grade years combined are the equivalent of the French I experience in high school; successful completion of those two years allows a freshman to enter directly into a French II course. The curriculum in grades seven and eight is thus more rigid, with more specific requirements. Grades five and six are more of an introduction to language and culture, with greater flexibility to explore concepts in greater depth. The fifth and sixth-grade years are big vocabulary-building years, and then in seventh and eighth grades, students are able to call on that vocabulary supply while practicing targeted grammar concepts in thematic contexts.
</p>
<p>
Any of the lessons or ideas put forth in this unit can be adapted to any grade/experience level. But my goal here is to create a unit fit for my second-year, sixth-grade students to be able to complete during the last marking period of sixth grade. May is the month we will revisit and expand on the foods vocabulary learned in fifth grade, and since it comes toward the end of the year, students will be well acquainted with the general learning goals and skills practice methods we employ in sixth grade. After starting with that brief review of vocabulary, we will quickly move into this new, multimedia unit. Up to this point, students will have had tastes of these media, but predominantly within the context of vocabulary-building and question-and-answer based units. By beginning from a place of confidence, students will be best-equipped to synthesize what they have learned all year in terms of numbers, expressing likes and dislikes, and describing things. By digging into websites and commercials, students will be able to see how far they have come at the same time as they are challenged to put it all together in practice. There will be plenty of options so that each student will be able to excel at his or her own pace. It is my intention that the placement of this unit will get students ready for the increased expectations of seventh-grade learning in a fun and exciting way.

<h2>
Technology, Authentic Text, and Listening Comprehension
</h2>
<p>
Using the interactive websites developed for the French market by McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and Quick (a European fast-food chain), students will get to see exactly what French children see when they go online to check out their favorite fast-food spot. This is authentic text that gives students the opportunity to absorb so much more than a vocabulary list! Students will hear different accents and rates of speech; they will have the opportunity to revisit things they need to hear a second time. Also providing printed out hard copies of the menus will give students an opportunity to focus on the offerings without getting distracted by all the bells and whistles of the websites, and will allow them to easily compare menus. Many sources of input provide repetition as well as more occasions for different types of learners to feel confident and successful. Sometimes in today's 21
<sup>
st
</sup>
Century Skills world, we forget that some learners are overwhelmed by multiple sources of sensory stimulation and could benefit from a little less sometimes. It is the job of the teacher to figure out how to best package and present the variety of materials available so that each student can work at his or her own comfort level while maintaining cohesion to the learning process as a whole. Taking time to familiarize yourself with all the options will allow you to better make those choices.
</p>
<p>
In today's technologically-fluent society, businesses are compelled to compete for our online attention in addition to wooing us with commercials and print ads. This competition provides the language teacher with a wealth of target-language, real-world resources to use in teaching. As students read and experience material that was written and created for a native French language speaker, they develop comprehension skills that will serve them in potential travels and conversations with real people as opposed to setting them up for success only in the isolated language-learning classroom. Students learning world languages today need to be exposed to a variety of different accents and registers of speech to be most successful in these real-world language situations. Listening to different commercials, as well as some of the interviews and other bonus features on restaurant websites, will give students this crucial experience. As you plan the particulars of this unit, I strongly recommend giving students some semi-structured time to explore these websites; this is perhaps best done by creating a scavenger hunt comprised of those features that will help students connect to the information and the language used. This gives students a useful framework for their exploration, and helps prevent mindless clicking and veering off-site.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Selecting and Using Commercials
</h2>
<p>
When viewing commercials, I recommend taking notes on what language functions are being used, with as many examples as you can manage to jot down, as well as what role each commercial could serve in the classroom. Doing that upon first viewing the commercial can save you a great deal of time later as you try to select the best commercials to use for each task planned. Some commercials are great for reviewing vocabulary and can be used as a springboard for a language activity, while others are better-suited to explaining what an unfamiliar menu item is all about. And some just give kids an opportunity to practice picking what they can understand out of a mostly incomprehensible conversation. They all may have a place in your unit, but they must be used and applied purposefully for the best learning to occur.
</p>
<p>
For finding French-language commercials, I recommend the following sites, in order:  http://www.culturepub.fr/, www.youtube.com, www.dailymotion.com, www.video.google.fr. (4) There are of course many other ways and means of locating useful commercials; these sites have worked well for me and I offer them as starting points.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes it can get overwhelming and frustrating to start your search and end up with lots of unwanted videos. Refining your search terms, or conversely, making them more broad, can help you pinpoint what you are looking for. I mostly used keyword searches comprised of the name of the establishment ("McDonald's", "Kentucky Fried Chicken", or "Quick restaurant") and "France" (for McDonald's and KFC) or "fast food" (for Quick.) (5) Adding in a particular year can help if you are looking for more current commercials. Alternately, try typing in a particular product name, and France. There will be a lot of misses along with your hits, so give yourself time to browse, and again, take notes! I make a document and copy and paste each commercial's URL along with a brief description and my notes. It may seem like extra work, but when you find yourself reviewing the same commercial several times because you forgot you already viewed it and didn't like it, you may reconsider!
</p>
<p>
I think commercials are a great way to hook interest at the beginning of a class; a clip can be played repeatedly so that as students enter class, they will (hopefully!) be intrigued by the commercial, which will cause them to settle in quickly and get to task. I prefer to have a Do-Now question already printed on a bi-weekly sheet created for that purpose, so students are prepared to engage with the task right away with full focus. Since the commercial will be repeating, students will be able to work at their own pace. To encourage those students who finish quickly to stay engaged, prompt students to jot down notes to every detail they see or hear. Then ask the class a more challenging question after the Do-Now is completed, so those who gave extra time or attention to the commercial will have an opportunity to stretch their wings a bit and show what they know.
</p>
<p>
Print advertisements and page printouts from the interactive websites can be used in daily practice as springboards for questioning and practicing relevant language skills. Depending on the ad, the questioning and responding might center around:  color and type of clothing seen in the picture, the location of items in relation to each other, how one might describe the people in the picture, where they seem to be going, what they are doing, what time of day it is. Images can be used in many different ways, and so using the same image for different purposes across language lessons will provide the student with a richer understanding and appreciation of the content and discoveries to be made. In this way, the unit can help students recycle language structures, phrases, and vocabulary not immediately relevant to the unit itself, to keep students constantly thinking with, using, and recombining all their language knowledge. Again, the interactive websites are rich, and getting the most out of them will require that you identify your objective for each activity clearly, and then provide a guideline/questionnaire/scavenger hunt/checklist to help students navigate their way through the carefully chosen maze that you craft for them.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Interview Activity Variations
</h2>
<p>
There are many ways to approach an interview activity, depending on what you want students to practice. I prefer to use every student's name as the row headings, and usually three to six columns of options or question points. Alternatively, you could have students write in the names of ten students for the row headings. I prefer having students' names already on the sheet because they love to see their name pre-printed; it seems to make them feel special, like you took the effort to bother with typing their names in there. That is well worth the few minutes it takes to make a personalized interview template! Also, I like having grids with more areas to complete because it gives the opportunity for faster-paced students to visit a lot of people without accomplishing the whole task before the rest of the class is done. It gives each student an opportunity to work at his or her own pace, without feeling as if he or she is too slow or way ahead of everyone else. Since the objective is not necessarily to "finish" the grid, I don't grade off for students not finishing. If a student is not fully participating, I work to re-engage that student; if that proves unsuccessful, I warn them that their grade will be affected. Then I make a note and let the student know that they have been marked down, but that exceptional participation for the remaining x number of minutes could earn that point back. That way the student has the most chances possible to succeed and self-correct.
</p>
<p>
When students participate in an interview activity, I instruct them to ask each student one question before asking the same student a second question, so that someone doesn't ask every question of only a few people. The goal is interaction with the whole class, or as many different students as possible. I also ask students to vary the column category question they are asking, so that a variety of question points are being practiced rather than the same question asked 26 times in a row, exactly the same way. As I walk around, I encourage students to rephrase questions in different ways when appropriate, for the same reason.
</p>
<p>
At different points in the unit, you can choose different interview focuses, starting with more simple constructions and functions to the more complex. In the beginning, you might choose five different menu items for the columns headers, and students can ask each other if they like each item, filling in only oui or non at the basic level. As students progress (in that same activity or as a new variation), they could write phrases or sentences, speaking as the other person or about the other person. So, students could move (again, in the same activity, and/or over several different variations of an activity) from the following interview grid responses: oui/non to aime/n'aime pas, to aime un peu/aime beaucoup, to adore/déteste, to recording each partner's responses as quotes with J'aime&gt;&gt;/Je n'aime pas&gt;&gt;, to Il/Elle aime/n'aime pas, to X,Y,et Z, ils/elles aiment/n'aiment pas. (6) With each alternative activity, you will want to tweak the questions students are asking, demonstrating when different phrasing can produce the same or synonymous responses and when little tweaks lead one to a specific answer. You want to give students enough practice so that they are able to demonstrate comfort and familiarity with the phrases without overdoing it so much that the fun and intrigue is gone. Changing the question possibilities offers the faster-paced learner the opportunity to continue practicing and acquiring new skills, at no cost to the slower-paced learner. More advanced options for questioning would be to ask if someone thinks that X is healthy, etc. (Est-ce que tu crois que X est sain/e, etc.) For this language level, I would provide the end of the sentence that combines the item with the adjective, so students start to see the adjective agreement but are not yet responsible for producing it.
</p>
<p>
There are countless ways in which the interview grid can be used in these lessons. I will highlight some as they fit in the sections below, but be creative! The interview grid can be pared down for more concentrated paired practice by replacing the row headings with a number of items and/or question stems, and by replacing the column headings with two to four blanks, in which students write down a partner's name. In that way, students get the opportunity to share more information with fewer people.
</p>
<p>
Once students have completed the interview grids, they can be used for class-wide question and answer, as in Est-ce qu'Étudiant X aime Y? (Does Student X like Y?) and Qui aime X? (Who likes X?) Not only does this keep kids accountable and engaged, but it also gives them practice outside of the you- and me-centric world of middle school language-learning by using third-person singular and plural forms of verbs.
</p>

<h2>
American Franchises in France – Product Exploration
</h2>
<p>
American franchises in France have had to adapt their offerings to appeal to local tastes. Students can compare print or online menus from French and English versions of McDonald's and Kentucky Fried Chicken to list, in a Venn diagram or some other comparison-oriented graphic organizer, items that are on both menus as opposed to items that are just on the French or American menus. I would assign this as homework, since I would rather use class time for full target language use. I do, however, think it is quite a worthwhile assignment for home exploration. Have students write a paragraph summarizing their findings and drawing conclusions from them; a writing assignment and rubric that fits in with your local English language writing goals and guidelines should be used for uniformity and most beneficial student practice.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Le Menu vs. La Carte
</h2>
<p>
Traditionally in France, le menu refers to a prix fixe or fixed-price grouping of items. In this case there are a few choices for each part of the meal experience (appetizer, main course, dessert); there may be several different menus at different price-points. Note that the word hors d'oeuvre which we have adopted in English and literally means outside of the work - in this case, the meal - is often confused with an appetizer. The hors d'oeuvre is a small bite, the "finger foods" people pass around on platters at functions before everyone sits down to eat. The appetizer is a planned part of the meal, served as the first, smaller course; it is called l'entrée in French, which makes sense really, as the appetizer is the "entrance" to the meal. In English, we use the term entrée to refer to the main course, which is named le plat principal in French, the principal or main plate or dish. As a welcome surprise, dessert is simply, le dessert!
</p>
<p>
La carte refers to what we in the U.S call the menu, the piece of paper or plastic that has all the offerings of the restaurant written on it. Currently, some places are calling that a menu also, but traditionally, it is strictly called la carte. When ordering à la carte, it means you are ordering items separately off the menu (carte) rather than ordering a fixed meal package option. When faced with an à la carte menu in the United States, many Americans, unfamiliar with the practice, order the steak and are disappointed when all they get is the steak! However, when dining à la carte, sides must be ordered separately.
</p>
<p>
None of our three restaurants list prices for all food items on their online menus, or cartes. This can be frustrating for the teacher looking to use this information in class. Although you could visit online chat boards and enlist people around France to tell you prices at their local restaurant, that would be time-consuming and potentially inaccurate. I emailed each establishment a request for paper copies or online documents with all prices, explaining my goal; so far I have not heard back from anyone, but perhaps that will be an option. You could always estimate prices based on the information you do have and provide those prices in a modified document. I prefer to give the students the menus as they are and use that as a discussion/writing point, asking students why the prices are listed for some items (the values) and not others. After that, you could have students compare French and American menus and practice converting dollars to euros, thus creating a modified menu with the calculated prices; students could also practice estimating skills in the same way.
</p>
<p>
In the sections that follow, I will introduce each fast food restaurant, providing pertinent websites and resources for advertisements and commercials. I will also include here examples of necessary vocabulary lists and some ideas for using the resources in the classroom.

<h2>
McDonald's:  Restaurant Background, Resources, and Strategies
</h2>
<h3>
Background
</h3>
<p>
Brothers Dick and Mac McDonald opened up McDonald's BBQ restaurant in 1940 in San Bernardino, California. (7) In 1948, they closed (for alterations) and reopened as McDonald's. The first franchise opened in Des Plaines, Illinois, in 1955; this is the date used to calculate anniversaries. By 1965 (the 10
<sup>
th
</sup>
anniversary) there would be more than 700 McDonald's locations in the U.S. The first McDonald's television commercial was broadcast in 1966. In 1967 McDonald's went international, opening locations in Mexico and Canada. Today, there are McDonald's located in more than 118 countries worldwide. Fresh salads were first introduced in 1987; the McDonald's website was born in 1996. According to Nadim Audi in his NY Times article "France, Land of Epicures, Gets Taste for McDonald's," there were 1,140 McDonald's in France, as of October 2009.
</p>
<p>
The French website for McDonald's is:  http://www.mcdonalds.fr/. The current catchphrase of McDonald's in France, as listed on the website, is:  Venez comme vous ítes. (Come as you are.) In the U.S and abroad, versions of the English I'm lovin' it have been used, with both of the following variations cited as being seen on French advertisements and packaging:  C'est tout ce que j'aime (It is everything that I love);  C'est ça que j'aime (It's this that I love). Some ads also use the young and modern text messaging shorthand for j'aime, which is J'M. Note the way this mirrors the McDonald's arches at the same time, for some slick double-duty advertising power!
</p>
<h3>
Commercial-Based Activities
</h3>
<p>
There are a great many French language McDonald's commercials available on the web. The challenge here is choosing the right ones to use with your students. Below are three examples of commercials that I would choose, along with a summary of the commercial, and how it could be used in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
Le Double Cheese:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTsg3STk-4E&amp;feature=channel
</p>
<p>
In this commercial, two males are sitting on a bench talking about the Double Cheese. One asks the other if he likes the Double Cheese. He responds that he does, and starts to describe how the parts were layered in the sandwich. We hear him describe it in the past tense, il y avait…, and so we learn that it used to be offered but is no longer. The men are quite nostalgic about it. The first tells his friend that the order in which he remembered the sandwich being made was wrong, and proceeds to tell him the correct way it was made. The friend tries to add tomatoes and is corrected yet again, that only pickles and onions were added, no tomatoes. So the friend who had been wrong sums it up correctly, the other adds ketchup and mustard, and he agrees. A voice-over is heard that says:  Vous l'avez adoré, le Double Cheese est de retour. (You loved it, the Double Cheese is back.)
</p>
<p>
Students at this level won't understand the tense changes to indicate that the burger wasn't offered for a while, but they should be able to read the body language and facial expressions of the two men. I would ask questions like:  Est-ce qu'ils mangent un Double Cheese à ce moment? (Are they eating a Double Cheese right now?) Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire, que le Double Cheese est de retour? (What does that mean, that the Double Cheese is back?) I would demonstrate leaving the class - Je sors de la classe, je suis de retour, quand je prends l'avion, j'achète un billet aller-retour–using motions and movements to clarify meaning and to cement it for students.
</p>
<p>
Some questions, like the first one, should be Oui/Non answerable, or answerable in simple French terms with which your students are familiar. Others, like the second, should be comprehensible to the student, so that he or she starts to wonder about why an establishment would stop selling an item, and why then it would "bring it back." In this way, a consumer-culture thought process can be initiated within the student, without the demand for an answer in class. To answer these types of questions in French is not level-appropriate for my students, but they can understand the questions. The point isn't for them to know how to answer that question in French, but to start to understand what is happening in the commercial, without taking class time to explain and discuss it in English. The first type of question can be used to get students speaking in the target language, either reiterating what was indicated, or by responding to questions that use structures you have been preparing them to use and answer. The second type of question can give students more input, as an opportunity for your faster-paced learners to make connections to structures and vocabulary beyond the lesson's goals, as well as to get the class engaging their higher order thinking skills.
</p>
<p>
At the bottom of the screen for most of the commercial, the following message is listed:  Pour votre santé, pratiquez une activité physique régulière. (For your health, practice regular physical activity.) At the last section, it changes to this:  Pour votre santé, éviter de grignoter entre les répas (For your health, avoid snacking between meals.) The website for the French national nutrition and health program (Programme Nationale Nutrition Santé, or PNNS) is listed as well. Some questions that could be asked are:  Est-ce que tu crois que la santé est importante en France? Pourquoi? (Do you think health is important in France? Why?) Est-ce que les publicités de McDonald's aux États-Unis ont un message de santé aussi? Pourquoi? (Do McDonald's advertisements in the United States have a message of health also? Why?)

Chicken Shake:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWF5lYtlcaY&amp;feature=related
</p>
<p>
This is a cute commercial that can show kids what the "Chicken Shake" is. A father opens his baggie of chicken, pours in a spice packet, closes the bag and shakes it (to get the chicken coated in spices.) His young child watches him, with his own carton of French fries in front of him. He mimics his father, and of course when it gets to shake time, he makes a mess. The father is so engrossed in his meal that he doesn't notice at first. When he does he looks around in embarrassment but then looks lovingly at his son. There is no spoken language during all of this, but at the bottom of the screen is another message from the PNNS:  Pour votre santé, mangez au moins cinq fruits et légumes  par jour. (For your health, eat at least five fruits and vegetables a day.) Then a woman's voice is heard saying:  Épicer, Secouer, Déguster. (Spice, Shake, Enjoy.) Nouveau Chicken Shake. Barbecue, curry, ou provençal. 2E95 deux euros quatre-vingt-quinze seulement. (New Chicken Shake. Barbecue, curry, or Provençal, 2 euros 95 only.)
</p>
<p>
There is very little language in this commercial, but it perfectly shows students what the Chicken Shake they will have seen on the menu is all about. Show this before they view the interactive menu, so they haven't already seen an image of the item. Before viewing the commercial, ask the students to write down and draw what they think the Chicken Shake is – Qu'est-ce que c'est, le Chicken Shake? Listez les ingrédients et dessinez un exemple, s'il vous plait. After viewing the commercial, questions can be asked to get kids thinking about how they could have figured out that it wasn't a milkshake. Est-ce que tu croyais que le Chicken Shake était un boisson? (Did you think that the Chicken Shake was a beverage?) Le Chicken Shake, c'est où dans le menu? (Where is the Chicken Shake on the menu?) C'est sous la catégorie boissons froides, desserts glacés, ou poulet? (Is it under the cold beverages, frozen desserts, or chicken category?) Est-ce que nous avons un plat similaire aux États-Unis? (Do we have a similar dish in the United States?) Here we are looking for the idea of Shake-n-Bake chicken. (8)
</p>
<p>
This commercial can be used as a springboard to discussing the different categories of food, which items fall into which categories, and what students like to eat for each meal. Create an interview grid, with student names down the side and the six categories of what students could eat and drink  breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert, beverage. Or perhaps the grid would work better over two days, exploring three categories one day and three the next. Another variation, the back of the grid could be blank or it could be what students don't like to eat for those categories. These decisions should be made based on where your class is; make the task one in which everyone can be successful, as described in the section entitled Interview Activity Variations.
</p>
<p>
Following are questions that can be asked in this section:  Qu'est-ce que tu aimes manger pour… le petit-déjeuner, le déjeuner, le dîner, le casse-cro—te, le dessert? (What do you like to eat for… breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert?); Qu'est-ce que tu aimes boire? Comme boisson? Comme boisson chaude? Comme boisson froide? (What do you like to drink? As a beverage? As a hot beverage? As a cold beverage?); Est-ce que tu aimes manger/boire X pour le petit-déjeuner, etc.? (Do you like to eat/drink X for breakfast, etc.?)
</p>
<p>
For upper levels, have students say present tense of verbs – I eat X when I am hungry, thirsty, craving salty things, etc.

Kentucky Fried Chicken:  Restaurant Background, Resources, and Strategies
</h2>
<h3>
Background
</h3>
<p>
In 1930, in the front room of a gas station, Harland Sanders opened Sanders Court &amp; Café in Corbin, Kentucky, serving as cook, cashier, and station manager. (9) In 1936 Harland was made an honorary colonel by then governor Ruby Laffoon for his contributions to the state's cuisine! The business expanded its seating in 1937, and was destroyed by fire in 1939. The business was rebuilt and reopened later that same year. At this time, the pressure cooker was introduced, which allowed fresher food to be delivered faster. Franchises began opening in 1952, the first one in Salt Lake City, Utah. By 1960 there were 400 franchise locations in the U.S. and Canada. In 1964 the first overseas KFC franchise opened in England. By 2006 there were KFC restaurants in more than 80 countries and territories worldwide.
</p>
<p>
The French website for Kentucky Fried Chicken is:  http://www.kfc.fr/. The current catchphrase of KFC is Tellement bon. (So good.) This is the same one used in the U.S today.

<p>
First KFC Television Commercial:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy-FCpkdp8Q
</p>
<p>
According to the KFCfrance username entry on YouTube, Kentucky Fried Chicken broadcast its first television commercial in France in April of this year (2010). It follows the journey of a bucket of KFC chicken from breading station to warming oven (although the frialators are visible in the background, the chicken is never actually shown frying, as if it went from breading station to oven.) The bucket then travels to a series of really fun events, where everyone is thrilled that someone brought the KFC. The soundtrack is upbeat; the only lyrics, the repetition of a single phrase - Oh yeah. At the bottom of the screen is the upper quarter of the KFC bucket, seen traveling to each fun new party as if the cameraman is carrying it, from roller coaster ride at an amusement park to leisurely watching a sunset with a loved one, to a zany costume party. The slogan is said at the end, and another message from our friends at the PNNS appears at the bottom of the screen. The commercial stresses the importance of the bucket as a way to share with friends; the music not only indicates fun but also a particular fusion of French and American fun.
</p>
<p>
The song is written and performed by a Parisian duo called Housse de Racket. Although only the chorus is excerpted for the commercial, the actual song begins with the following line, in French: I have a big plan for the future, to please her I'll become. Next the names of a series of African-American musicians are given. Then the repetition of oh yeah to that catchy tune. The only other lyric is the last sentence, in French, saying I'll change, tomorrow or maybe never. (10) The group is popular with young people in France and England right now, as evidenced by a perusal of the band's wall/friend comments on their MySpace and Facebook (social networking sites) pages. (11)
</p>
<p>
This commercial would fit nicely at the end of a class, as a way to have students consider some of our big marketing questions. After viewing the commercial, students can write an answer to a higher order thinking question, in English. Current language arts high-stakes testing question stems should be used to create the question, so that you are giving your students relevant writing practice. Ask a language arts teacher or another helpful resource to offer guidance in both scoring and providing constructive feedback to the student. This would be a great Think-Pair-Share opportunity if you have a few extra minutes, so that students are getting the full benefit of exploring the concept without taking too much from our valuable in-class French-speaking time.
</p>

<h2>
QUICK:  Restaurant Background, Resources, and Strategies
</h2>
<h3>
Background
</h3>
<p>
QUICK is the only European fast food hamburger chain restaurant operating on an international level. (12) The first two QUICK restaurants opened in Schoten and Waterloo, Belgium, in 1971; in 1978 the first franchise opened in Brussels. The first French location opened in Aix-en-Provence in 1980, and on the island of La Réunion in 2001. In 2007-2008, QUICK started a small-scale expansion effort with locations opening in Algeria, Russia, Catalonia, and New Caledonia, and a franchise agreement established in 2009 in the French West Indies. QUICK is the number one fast food hamburger chain in Belgium and Luxembourg, and number two in France.
</p>
<p>
The website for QUICK is:  http://www.quick.fr/. Their current catchphrase is Nous, c'est le gout. (QUICK, the taste, or We are the taste.)
</p>
<h3>
Commercial-Based Activities
</h3>
<p>
The following are some commercial links that can be used to show students a variety of young people in France, in order to allow them to draw many similarities while still exploring any differences they notice.
</p>
<p>
The first is from 2007 and shows people lining up in the streets as if waiting for a rock star. The mob soon busts through the doors of Quick, holding a young man eating a burger above their heads. This is the "Méga Giant Tour" of three méga giant burgers being offered for a limited time only. I think one of the burgers will especially draw the attention of students; it is called the Xtralong Giant and is three patties laid across a sub roll. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr3nUTvfEEs&amp;feature=related.
</p>
<p>
Next is an ad from 2009 for the Googrill, a burger whose name plays on the sound of the word go—t in the Quick catchphrase, c'est nous, le gout. The rate of speech is very fast, with slang (argot in French) being used:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czlR9cezZaM&amp;feature=related.
</p>
<p>
From 2007, this commercial shows collectible mugs from the American television series "Friends" being offered on promotion:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22UM8NXqGIs&amp;feature=related.
</p>
<p>
The following is an older commercial from 1993 for Chicken Dips, featuring cartoon animals: http://www.ina.fr/pub/societes-de-service/video/PUB3774399104/quick-hamburger-restaurant-chicken-dips-fast-food.fr.html.

<h2>
Classroom Activity 1 – Le Double Cheese
</h2>
<p>
Here is a collection of key vocabulary, language functions, and grammar concepts used in the Double Cheese commercial, which can be used to create and promote a multitude of conversational activities.
</p>
<p>
Vocabulary of Quantity and Order:  Numbers 1-10; une tranche de… (a slice of…); des (for plural, as in des cornichons, some pickles); une autre (another); d'abord (first); second (second); ensuite (then, after, next); après çela (after that); puis (then); finalement (lastly, finally); Non, c'est l'inverse (No, it's the opposite).
</p>
<p>
Food Vocabulary:  Un steak haché (they don't use the word "patty" in French, pâté, but rather this phrase, meaning a ground steak or beef burger); un cheese (at the bottom of the screen, there is a message that says:  cheese  fromage fondu which equates cheese with melted cheese); le cornichon (pickle); l'oignon (m. - onion), la tomate (tomato), le bun de pain (McDonald's uses this term, otherwise called le petit pain hamburger (hamburger bun, literally little hamburger bread); la salade/la laitue (la salade is a generic term for lettuce, and the one most often used; it is also used to indicate a meal salad. La laitue is specifically lettuce. McDonald's uses un lit de salade (a bed of lettuce); le ketchup (ketchup), la moutarde (mustard), la mayonnaise (mayonnaise); pickle relish doesn't show up on this menu as it is not really used in France, but if students want to know it, the following three phrases have been used:  le condiment aux cornichons, le confit de cornichons, le relish aux cornichons).
</p>
<p>
Grammar concepts:  Taking nouns from singular to plural. There is/there are (il y a), from there was, there were (Il y avait); It is (c'est) from it was (c'était); What…? (quels…? (m.)/quelles…? (f.); There aren't any… (il n'y a pas de…), using Est-ce que to ask a yes/no question.
</p>
<p>
Language functions:  Asking if someone likes something:  Tu aimes…? (You like…?) Est-ce que tu aimes…? (Do you like…?) Moi, j'aime…, et toi? (Me, I like…, and you?); Replying that you do or don't like something: J'aime…. (I like….) Je n'aime pas…. (I don't like….) Moi aussi (Me too), Moi non plus (Me neither), Pas moi! (Not me!), (plus whatever intermediate levels of liking you have used with your students.)
</p>
<p>
Conversational Language: Eh…(Hey…), Ah ouais (Oh yeah); Vraiment? C'est vrai? (Really?)
</p>
<p>
Students can practice making fake sandwiches and having partners follow the directions, correcting them when they forget. They can use colored felt, cardboard, and/or paper to represent the layers of food items, or they can draw them if necessary. Following is an excerpt of the commercial, modified to be all in present tense, for use in this activity. Students could use the whole excerpt first, to practice the structures with support; then they can practice the ordering, re-ordering, and correcting with many different options substituted for the quantities, items, and order given.
</p>
<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>
<dt>
A:  Eh, tu aimes le double cheese?
<dt>
B:  Ah ouais, il y a une tranche de cheese, deux steaks hachés, et une autre tranche de cheese.
<dt>
A:  Non, c'est l'inverse. C'est d'abord un steak haché, ensuite une tranche de cheese, second steak
<dt>
haché, seconde tranche de cheese….
<dt>
B:  Et les tomates?
<dt>
A:  Quelles tomates? Il n'y a pas de tomates
</dt>
</dt>

<h2>
Classroom Activity 2 – KFC and Quick
</h2>
<p>
Although the online menus for Kentucky Fried Chicken and Quick are quite interactive, for some exercises they may prove to be a bit too much so. This activity will have students comparing kid's meals at Quick and KFC; print out the menu options rather than have students use the interactive site. I recommend using the following website for the Quick menus, as it reads more like a traditional document: http://www.quick45.com/menus.htm. This is the listing of different menus – fixed price meals, offered at locations in the north central area of France. Print and cut out the bottom two options, Le Menu Top (ages 8-12) and La Magic Box (ages 3-7). The KFC website, www.kfc.fr, doesn't change URL addresses with each click, so to get to the menu options, follow this click path: Home  Découvrez Nos Produits  Menus Énfants (Nouveau) – Boxy. Then follow the same path and click Ze Bag (ages 3-6) instead of Boxy (ages 7-12).
</p>
<p>
Pair students and give each pair an envelope with each menu option on separate paper (each group will have four papers, two from Quick and two from KFC). Students will work together to complete a graphic organizer comparing each meal by the following categories:  Choice/Variety (Choix/Variété), Cost (Co—te), Health (Santé), Advertising/Packaging (Publicité/Emballage), Toy (Jouet – don't forget to relate it to the verb jouer), Quantity of Food (Quantité de Nourriture). The graphic organizer should be double-sided, with two columns per side; students should decide if they want to put both meals from the same restaurant on one side or if the meals geared towards a particular age level from each restaurant should go on the same side. Each column should have the equivalent of a pro/con dividing line so that students can take notes on the pros and cons of each meal or package. An example of the organizer can be found in:  Appendix B – Kid's Meal Graphic Organizer
</p>
<p>
Pairs will determine the best meal in each category, as well as an overall winner. Results will be tallied and discussed. This will help prepare students for the culminating project detailed below.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>
Classroom Activity 3 – Culminating Project
</h2>
<p>
Just as fast-food restaurants have modified their offerings to reflect local tastes, students will now create a Kid's Meal that represents their own culture. They will name the meal as well as all the individual components of the meal, and they will create a catchphrase to sell the meal. After seeing many different examples from the three restaurants we have been exploring, students will have an array of input to help them decide upon their own creation.
</p>
<p>
All websites should be provided on a sheet detailing the parameters of the project and the specific sites being used, to be signed by parents (so that way the kids aren't on Facebook saying that it is for French class, and parents are involved in what students are doing.) Provide enough class time to use computers so that students can get what they need if they have no computer access at home.
</p>
<p>
The project should be clearly laid out, and each part due in stages with the opportunity for constructive feedback.
</p>
<p>
After the meal, its components, and its catchphrase are determined, viewed, approved, and given feedback, students will create an image representation of the meal, like a poster advertisement or a single screenshot of an interactive website, that includes all the pertinent information, such as choice of items, cost, descriptions, sizes, and catchphrase.
</p>
<p>
Once that is created, viewed, approved, and given feedback, students will view each advertisement and rate their favorites according to the categories we have been using - Choice/Variety, Cost, Health, Advertising/Packaging, Toy, Quantity of Food – with the Overall score being tallied by adding all those scores up. Students will work in groups of three to four, so depending on how many students are in your class, do the math and select the appropriate number of winning advertisements. The students who created those advertisements will be team leaders. In regards to which students work with those team leaders, how you proceed will depend on the dynamics of each individual class. Although there are many ways to make those choices, by the teacher and by students, I will offer here one option that gives students choice without alienating anyone. Have team leaders write the names of one to two students they would and would not like to work with, giving reasons. Have other students do the same for team leaders. That night, read through the responses and create groupings.
</p>
<p>
These groups will create a commercial for their product. Students can perform it as a skit, film it, make a PowerPoint Slideshow, use a program such as Microsoft Photostory, etc. (13) The idea is to give students the freedom to use whatever resources and skills they have, while not penalizing anyone who doesn't have the same resources. Give students a rubric reflecting the type of work and practice done in your unit. To view the commercials, it would be fun to bring in some snacks if allowed, whether healthy options from McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken or something that reflects French cuisine. The commercials should again be rated; perhaps the highest-scoring one wins a McDonald's lunch for its teammates.

(5) Putting phrases that  go together in quotation marks, ("Kentucky Fried Chicken," for example) will bring up pages that have those words together, as opposed to a page that has a reference to the state of Kentucky as well as chicken farming and fried potatoes, all on the same page.

(6) When I teach about guillemets, I like to use the English "air quotes" gesture and flip it on its side to represent the French quotation marks. It happens to look all at once hip-hop, peace-and-love, and somewhat heavy-metal, plus just plain silly, so the kids like doing it. For a funny "tutorial" on how to do air quotes, visit the following link:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzRPiFXMKpg. For my version of air guillemets, face your palms inward and horizontally for step one and proceed!

(8) At some point you will want to address the borrowing of English-language words in French as well as the borrowing of French-language words in English. See the Anthonioz article listed in the Resources section. Also, consider the idea that the Oxford American Dictionary adds colloquialisms to its listings each year; past entries include the verb "unfriend," used to describe deleting someone from your Facebook friend list, and EVOO to name extra-virgin olive oil, a term coined by television foodie Rachel Ray. The Académie Française strictly prevents something like that happening, but visit the following site for an extensive list of English words borrowed from French:  http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mots_fran%C3%A7ais_d'origine_anglaise (07/30/10).

(13) I learned so much about using technology in units, as well as everything else about teaching a world language really, from Japanese teacher Jessica Haxhi, at any of the many professional development opportunities she has taught that I have been fortunate enough to attend.
